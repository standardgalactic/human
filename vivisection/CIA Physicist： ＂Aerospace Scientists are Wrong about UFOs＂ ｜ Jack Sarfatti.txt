You were trying to explain to me last night when I was asking you about the grush testimonies
and all the stuff that he was saying and I was explaining to you that I was highly skeptical
of the whole thing.
The fact that they made it this big dog and pony show on national television and you know
I always question it when the government starts to get behind it I always question motives
and what's going on.
Okay first when you say the government there is no such thing anymore.
There's no government.
We're in a state of chaos.
The government is you know what Balkanization means Balkan you know like Yugoslavia there
are different what you see right now happening you know with the extreme Democrats are trying
to put in jail all the guys around Trump you know that's like civil war that's a civil
war we're in a civil war shooting each other but they're trying to stop their fear in the
election.
It's like a political war.
But it's getting real bad I mean they're trying to put this has never happened in the United
States like it's like a banana republic now.
Yes.
You know it's like I mean they what do they do you know yeah Putin might do this right
Putin just killed oh oh who's the guy Greg Ocean the one the guy the only thing you
haven't done I'm yeah it's not been great Donald Trump's airplane has not been shot
down yet right but maybe that's coming you know I wouldn't be surprised would you know
I honestly wouldn't be surprised so there's no difference between what's happening in
Russia with Putin and what's happening in the United States it's the same thing it's
it's organized crime all over the place what it is it's like the mafia it's like different
gangs are fighting each other Russian mafia against the Italian when you're talking about
these different gangs you're talking about different factions of the government like
they're all in the government now yes they're all in the government now the government we
don't have a legitimate government anymore so so you meant so that's what you're talking
about when you say there's a war going on in the intelligence community yeah right now
there are guys there are guys okay there's Trump deranged was there there's a there's
Sarfati deranged was there I have people in the CIA and or for ex CIA who are supporting
what I'm doing and then I have guys who are trying to destroy me they if I get hit by
a car who's trying to destroy you Christopher Mellon's trying to destroy me why that's a
good question why would he want to what would his motive be it because we got into a fight
over Donald Trump you and Christopher Mellon did yeah that's a we were gonna go on fine
he was gonna come up to do a thing at the Bohemian Grove on UFOs he's gonna come you
and him we're gonna go to Bohemian Grove I invited him we were gonna have a big thing
there okay I invited okay we should know this podcast of Bohemian Grove that would be great
yeah well I I mean you know the guy the guy can we get the big owl statue this is a big
statue still there yeah of course the owl yeah that was still there but they'll never
let me back now but you know what the hell do I care that but it's true no well there
was this guy Don Rich who's now died Don Rich was one of the top members of the Bohemian
Grove ah okay let me tell you about Don Rich just passed away about a year ago oh yeah
just about a little more than a year and a half ago he passed away Don Rich okay Don
Rich was born in Idaho cowboy he's half Indian half Apache and cowboy his grandfather was a
Texas Ranger yeah he grew up on a ranch in boy in Idaho and his father was a friend of Kenneth
Arnold worked for Kenneth Arnold who was a big ranch Kenneth Arnold is the pilot who in 1947
saw first saw the right the flying discs yes so Don was a little boy that four or five years old
when was there when Kenneth Arnold came back and had just seen the flying saucers and told what's
that you know Don heard Kenneth Arnold telling his father about what had just happened but he
just saw uh huh so right there at the beginning right there's okay there's some other stuff
for flying so so of course so Don Rich was into flying so it's from the very beginning because
he's the Kenneth Arnold his father worked for the Kenneth Arnold okay so Don about my age maybe
two years younger than me he would have been 82 now so Don goes into the Marines and becomes a
tank commander see some action I guess I don't know in South America I maybe I when they were you
know I forget where it was not the not uh not Granada I think was something else and uh and he
gets out of the Marines in the 60s yeah must have been was he in Vietnam I don't know
but he's an artist he's a sculptor so Don has a big forge you know Ford for Steve does massive
steel sculptures you know stuff I know and he had a forge in in Oakland famous thing and he can't
say he's quite successful he worked with Buffano you know a bunch of famous he got involved with
all these famous people and he started teaching of course this is the art institute here started
teaching at the art institute you know so it's like the late 60s and then this guy who I think
is probably connected with Chipman it wasn't Chipman but this guy Colonel Harry Wolfe which may
not be his real name this guy now comes up one day knocks on the door at about 1969
and Don's brother who's now a Colonel in the Marines his brother you know he went in because
his older brother was in the Marines okay and you know Semper fi the Colonel Harry Wolfe says
listen we what we need we need you to do some work for us he's CIA well you know CIA
and but his job is now if he does this for a couple years he you know part of it is a courier
what's called the courier they give him stuff where he has to you know hand comfort to himself
gets on airplanes and he has to deliver things small packages
and he's delivering stuff to the he said what time went to China Shanghai even and but the
French intelligence the bit of the MI6 the Australians he was going all over you know
with this stuff and but and turned they were now we were talking about they were the parts
for Roswell crash parts for the Roswell crash saucer that you know that Phil Corso talks about
trying to reverse engineer all that stuff right Dave so Don is you know he's involved and then
at one point Harry Wolfe see this is this Harry Wolfe gives he says hey keep this for me
by the way give us some LSD some L you know the CIA the LSD there's some LSD stuff involved
here too but I don't want to get into but because I don't know fully what was really going on Don
was never clear about it but apparently Don Wolf yeah Don this guy this guy uh Harry Wolfe was
also involved with MK Ultra that's what it was it was that they were doing LSD experiments on
people and stuff like that yeah he was involved he's probably so that means he had to be involved
with Chipman too back then okay this before I knew Chipman I know Chipman for all right so uh
but this is all a CIA operation or whatever the okay and so um so uh Harry Wolfe gives him this
army duffel bag like AAF 19 you know Roswell on it old you know and Harry says don't look in this
I'll be back in a week to get it so of course he opens it up right in it if you read Corso
there's about the strut like the aluminum was struck with the symbols like the Egyptian
hurried left symbols on it yeah that's a heat it's there it's there he has it in his hand
okay okay this is I'll show you a photo of me and Don and you know and he's got it and he's
and you know he says forward you know he's settling torches got everything and he tries he
he can't do it's like it's resists any kind of thing except sometimes he could cross some of you
could crumple like night like and it restores so and it hardly weighs anything it's like it's
anti-gravity almost and then it generally starts like almost floating wow okay so this is he's
telling me though I said I got other witnesses not just me Kim and this other guy Larry Lemke
who works for Jacques Valet and Gary Nolan you know Gary Nolan is okay so down you know
Larry works with me they analyze these materials right no this is back in 1968
this is Don Rich tell this is way before any of this stuff now okay it's back in 1968 1969
and Harry Wolf comes and takes it back okay so now all this stuff by the time I am content I had
it I mean oh yeah so Don Rich's nephew named Will Eroken who actually works I think for DreamWorks
for Spielberg or something like yeah he does you know computer animation his kid he's young he uh
his nephew this is about six years ago seven years ago I forget exactly walks in the Cafe atreus
me and Kim you know Kim he met and says hey I got you guys got to meet my uncle because he knows
about you and he's into flying saucers and all this stuff and he's very big at Bohemian Grove
he wants you guys to take you into the Bohemian Grove so that's how we met that's how we met
and Don he had you know he had a big library he read everything he knew exactly he knew this
stuff was real okay Don at this point they had a memorial I was at the memorial when he died
Bohemian Grove you know the tall the top guys you know think highly of him Don was one of the six
guys who run the Grove you know in charge of the you know they have you know make sure everything
you know physically you know make sure everything you know they have a fire police force and stuff
like that make sure you know the minute make sure everything is operating properly he didn't
like to go to the city club but he liked to go up to Grove so we would go up to the Grove with him
all the time you know hang out with him he had they built these different camps next door was
Clint Eastwood's camp okay and then we have a at his camp you know and there's all these camps
all these guys camp where Henry Kissinger and Bloomberg and all these guys I heard Robert Gates
Robert Gates giving a lecture up there on the lake there by the big statue you know and the
lake and Robert Gates this is back like 2017 or something like that I don't know if Trump was
president the idea and Gates is talking somebody asked about Joe Biden Joe Biden you know Bill Gates
no Robert Gates who was secretary of defense oh Robert Gates he was the secretary of defense
I've gotten to who not Bill Gates although Bill Gates would go there I'm sure yeah but now Robert
Gates somebody asked him a question about what do you think of Joe Biden basically
Robert Gates says Joe Biden's is dumb as a rock I know rocks that are smarter than Joe Biden he says
every foreign policy decision position that Joe Biden has supported has turned out to be a disaster
this is back before nobody was taking Joe Biden as president and this supports all and I heard Gates
say this and then this supports when Trump says that when he spoke to Teddy Kennedy this is back
when you know Trump was a Democrat was you know he knew the Clint Eastwood but the wedding in fact
in fact the Trump's daughter and Chelsea good friends with Jeffrey Epstein no oh no that's that's
bullshit okay it's not bullshit no no I know exactly what it is okay don't tell me because I know
better than you I have better I know a lot about Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump I've done a lot
of research on that now yeah but I know too what I know is this here's what I Donald Trump never went
to the island Clinton went to the island Jeffrey Epstein was a member of the Mar-a-Lago club as are
a thousand people okay and then Jeffrey Epstein started hitting on a 15 year old daughter of the guy
one of the guys who works at the club the gate the gardener or something like that
and as soon as Trump found that out he kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of yeah he said hang out
everybody but so did the Clinton so did everybody right everybody did right yeah everybody did
but but but I don't think there's any proof that Trump ever went to the island Trump was probably
more connected to Epstein than than anybody else if it was it was financial stuff I don't
I don't think it was sex I'm pretty sure it wasn't sex I don't know about that I don't think there's
any evidence of that with Trump doing that but I think it wasn't but I know I know Trump has been
to his um townhouse in New York a number of times but they were all war I mean they all were of
course right Clinton I mean I you know anybody's anybody was I mean Epstein I'm sure it's
this is this is Epstein is Mossad right 100% yeah I think yeah I agree I agree so Epstein's job
was to compromise so they have like it like like uh Jake who would you know had dirt on everybody
right yeah yeah I mean even though even though Hoover himself was gay right right right yeah yeah
no no no it's boy friend we know about that yeah so yeah so yeah so that's true but I do know for
sure that when Trump found out about you know the girl that the thing he he he kicked he kicked
Epstein out of Monologue so take your money you know welcome here right yeah I don't think I don't
think Trump uh there's any evidence of Trump doing any sort of business or hanging out with Epstein
after he was convicted the first time yeah yeah and unlike Bill Gates who actually like met up with
him and let me tell you something else a bunch of my physicist friends hung out went to the island
yeah Stephen Hawking Stephen Hawking went to the island yeah with Kip Thorne who got the Nobel Prize
they went and a bunch of other this guy who runs Santa Barbara if we want to get into all the dirt
I forget his name now um guy who runs the Santa Barbara Institute of Physics spent a lot of time
there a lot of people and this guy Seth Lloyd at my too it's very good physicist by the way
now I'm not saying they I don't think they I think when the let me say this when the physicists were
there I don't think there was any hanky-panky going no no no that was he held a lot of big events there
and he brought a lot of people there and that was part of his operation it it was easier to get high
level people with money like Bill Gates if you see that look all these other high level academics
and physicists scientists are going there what's wrong with me going there you're not going to
think twice about it well the same thing happened see Warner Ahron did the same thing but Warner
Ahron was not into sex or anything like that uh with me because Warner Ahron was supporting us this
is back in in the 70s and he did the same thing that Epstein did but he was not involved in anything
you know ulterior like that right there was nothing yeah it was nothing with kids or anything
like that right but they also he had all these famous the Feynman and Lenny Suskind and you know
all the famous Hawking and Kip Thorne they all went went there here and said this was in San Francisco
so yeah so that was and and uh and Warner was also an intelligence agent I'm not sure for who
but it could be the Mossad but probably CIA but it could be the Russians actually because he went
to Russia afterwards so I don't know who who who he was but it was definitely part of the intelligence
right um all right so that's that's a standard thing they do yes yeah um I want to get into
the warp drive stuff yeah okay can we talk about that can you explain to me your your warp drive
theory and how that works I'll try okay the warp drive theory okay so now it's a little bit okay I'll
I'll use if you look at Bob Lazar's videos where he talks about gravity a and gravity b when he
talks about the you said the the flying saucer falling freely through space yes okay that's what
it is but now what it is is Einstein's theory of general relativity about gravity gravity is the
bending of the space itself it's the warping of space itself what's called curvature
the curvature of space and time is gravity this is okay so gravity is space and time itself is
like there's an electromagnetic field there's a spacetime field it's a field
okay gravity field is spacetime no difference okay if you can control gravity you control space and
timing that's time travel okay the problem has always been everybody knew this this episode is

sponsoring this episode back to the show the promise always been that the strength of the
gravitational interaction i don't want to say force they say force is not these interactions
not a force gravity is not a force the way electricity is a force but the strength of the
interaction of gravity with matter is normally very weak okay and it's and so energy if i have a
concentration of energy in the volume what's called a stress energy density it's called
will warp space time so if i had enough energy and if i could shape that energy distribution
properly i can make space time warp anyway i want it to okay that's what these machines we see are
doing that's what they're doing the problem has always been that when you put in the numbers of
Einstein's actual equations the the coupling is so weak that it takes impossible amount of energy
to accomplish that task okay but we know from Ryan Graves and Commander Frava from the tic-tac
and all this stuff what we see them doing is that's what they are controlling gravity but with
small amounts of energy so there's something missing in our physics okay okay that's the missing
link that's what i saw the energy right yeah that's the energy barrier and so the thing is this i would
say right away as soon as it's warp drive like when kevin canuth with all these guys at when
they're at that congressional meeting said thing is going hundreds of geese that's impossible
because inside the ship they're weightless remember i told you inertial observers you're the space
suit floating through space right inside that's that's the the correct part of what
Lazar says where the thing the thing is the ship is falling freely like it's falling through space
weightless you know when you fall you're weightless right okay like on on the space it's on the space
station what's going around oh but you know they're floating around because no right they're not
firing the rocket engines right they're floating around right so what they're doing the ship is
it's like on the space station but it has a little maybe that little fusion react whatever you know
that the has a control system where it's able to change the shape of the space around it yes
so it can control anyway wants to go yes so even though on the outside it's going at 5000
what a pair it's called kinetic acceleration there's no actual the g-force the actual g
inside they're weightless exactly okay outside they're really all moving as if they're going 5000
g and you know a billion zillion jillion miles a second but inside they're weightless so we
understand that right away yeah easy right easy conceptually you know anybody understands but
the guy's the cia director doesn't understand it yet i don't think so hains none of these they don't
understand it they don't understand it yet i'm i'm trying to explain them they don't understand it
forever doesn't understand it ryan graves doesn't understand it i can explain it to him
and when i tried to explain to chris melan he got mad he didn't want to hear it he said no you don't
know why didn't you say that this guy christopher melan he's a schmuck he he i mean you know he's a
schmuck but it comes to science what what is christopher melan telling jack sarfati that that he
knows more physics than jack sarfati i don't think he would claim to have no more physics he did well
he effectively did he said no it's uh you you said yeah you can't be so sure i think he was trying
to like put it down you can't be so sure you know it's a thousand years ago we won't know and he's
never taken a physics course right and here i'm here to see i am he's a stupid guy who shouldn't be
independent he was he's a melan his guy you know and by the way his cousin uh john warner's a friend
of mine his cousin his cousin agrees with me they have the same grandfather they grew up together
john says yeah my cousin's an idiot that's incredible okay john warner
who was senator warner's son you know his mother was his stepmother was elizabeth taylor and all that
you know all right yeah all right so a navy secretary of the navy all into ufo's okay so so okay
so both john warner and chris melan we all agree ufo's are real it's a threat right is it a threat
of course it's a threat how is it a threat it's a threat because we because some of them are not
friendly because they're many different there's not just one which ones aren't friendly well i don't
know the ones that contacted me presumably are friendly but the ones the ones there are people
who've been hurt that's what that's what joc valet is working on that's what gary no one's working
on right they're working on the blood they've been they said at least people have died yeah i got
sick now may not be deliberate the main course because you see that's what okay in my theory i
explain when you have anti gravity if the thing if you're under okay if you have if there's a ufo
hovering and you stand under it you're not going to live long you can get radiation radiation yeah
because it's what's called the blue shift okay yeah explain the blue red shift how that works
that's really interesting that this is basic physics if you have an attractive force field
if you're an attractive force field and you're like in what's called in your if it's a negative
potential energy and you're down like toward the bottom what's called the gravity well and then
and you want to get out of it if you want to get out you have to like walk it up the hill yes okay
walk it up the hill you got exert energy you're losing energy so when light does that light is a
photon it's a packet of energy where the energy is proportional to the frequency so in order for
the light to escape the gravity field it's losing some of its energy just the way you're you're
expending energy by burning food you're walking up the hill so some of its energy so the frequency
goes down that's the red shift so that's okay the red shift means you know that's not ionizing
that's lower the energy then you can't do much damage it's just like heat you know it's low
energy red light yeah like reddish light the red shift but with anti-gravity it's the opposite
with anti-gravity it's like it's like you're at the top of the hill okay at the top of the hill
you're on a scooter you know one of these scooters in fact they do you're on a skateboard you're
on a skateboard and you're you're gaining energy yes and that's the photon so the photon increases
frequency that's blue and it gets an ionized that's that's that's like it's like a nuclear bomb
gamma rays high energy gamma ray high energy light so so the so the what happens is the light escaping
from below the thing it's anti-gravity right because it's it's hovering it's it's the anti-gravity
cancelling the earth's gravity right it's just hovering there so so but but but but radiation
any kind of light energy that's coming from the thing it's it gets enough energy and ionizes the
the air sorry and ionizes the air molecules and that causes ionization and that you know if it's
really high energy it's the same as a as a bond it's like radioactivity yeah it's like it's like
the effects of a of a nuclear bomb blast okay obviously it's happened because these people are
getting radiation sickness right that was on i think it was on the pdf you sent me it really
described it nicely where it shows you the person and it shows the the spacecraft moving towards you
or away oh yeah okay yeah that's the that's the that's the Sarfati uh this guy that's one of my
discovered so one of my predictions normally you know the Doppler shift the motion Doppler shift
if you know if if a locomotive with a whistle is coming toward you the pitch goes up right
right right and if it's going away for you the pitch goes down yep with the ufo it's going to be
the opposite as the as the ufo comes toward you if you have the right if you're if you're commander
favor in your f18 and you have the right instruments okay what Doppler radar with frequency shifts
and stuff like that when you see the thing is coming toward you it's approaching you it's the
frequencies are going to be lower redshifted just the opposite of what you would expect from the
Doppler shift and the opposite the other way so it's coming towards you the frequencies get lower
yes and when it gets farther away they get higher yeah and and if you see that that is
smoking on that's what then you know that's a warp drive ship it's a warp drive yeah very simple
that's jack sarfati predict i'm the first one to say that that's my prediction from the theory and
uh frank millburn who wrote these so why is it the opposite of a train because that's just
the way because i explained because the because that was the gravity thing if you think about it
you see that's it's gravity is different from motion it's not motion got it got it that makes
sense yes it's so they work opposite to each other right okay so that's how you can tell if now if
the ship is moving through air if it's ordinary motion you'll get a regular Doppler shift if it's
warping space you get the opposite so it's a very simple experimental thing that the military
should have by now but they're so stupid maybe they have it okay maybe they do but they have aren't
the top scientists from around the globe working for the government working in these no because
they're stupid because they don't listen to me okay because they're dumb are the jason were the
jason scientists dumb well back then the jason's i didn't know any of this stuff i was a kid then
that was too many years ago but you don't think we still have programs like this with super no
because they're too stupid they don't they well some of them are maybe not we now with
lauren spirkley laboratory is done in secrets i didn't know this until two days ago three day
four days a few days ago last week i find out that at lauren spirkley lab they they have this big
warp fuser reactor and they're testing the sarfati equation i don't they haven't done that's just
i think it's a have you trademarked this what sarfati equation yes that's what they called
yes who calls it that what who calls it that who who calls it the sarfati equation the guys on
lauren's living more they all call it that it's in their publication like oh yeah it's yeah and
they got it from my paper i mean this month there's a guy there the guy in charge his phd
named michael godner michael g anderson he's in charge of their laser fusion stuff this is
for some of us it took their weapons is right and apparently according to larry lemke who works
with jacqueline and gary nullan they must have been yeah because they quote a paper mine from three
years ago three or four years ago okay okay they've been working on this thing secret okay now how
do the meta materials fit into this okay well wait but first okay well that's the meta materials
okay what they're doing at lauren's berkeley living more it's not meta it's it's plaza it's few it's
it wasn't called it's a heavy ion fusion plasma fusion it's a different thing it's right but when
it comes to the spacecraft and the way the way it moves how the the way you just explained it with
that with the ionization of the light the meta material and you know all these guys like harrell
put off and louie elizando and and even melin they all talk about and eric dames they talk about
meta materials but they never explain how the meta materials help all they say is that well it looks
as though these are the stuff from that roswell crash they explain like a foil that the crumples
up they let me let's always tell you that's what don riche had exactly that's he had that but he
didn't know about meta materials this is like he's not a scientist to me you know you know he didn't
have an electron microscope to look at it right he didn't have the stuff gary nullan has he didn't
know so the thing is this okay so what i have a theory you know and we're working on it now
that by pumping the meta material with enough resonant electromagnetic energy we create what's
called a it's basically like a room temperature superconductor it's called a furlick condensate
it's like a laser it's analogous to a laser but the stuff that's lazing and what are called quasi
particles that are just emergent emergent properties of the material itself so it doesn't
go out into vacuum right you know it's like it's like the material itself develops a new kind of
quantum mechanical phase where it's coherent it's like it's basically it could be used as a room
temperature superconductor but the point is you have to keep pumping it with energy it's like
like a lazy you have to keep supplying it with energy okay okay and that's us we are that too
biologically we're lasers because what do you think all the same lasers yeah we're biological
lasers the the math of life is the same as the math of the laser very similar wow this is and this
is what this is well this is a guy these are guys in germany who've developed this i forget what
those guys say but i have the books here i got the books right there um i'm sure books in here
yeah and so so in any case so the point is see this is how the consciousness and the warp drive
are connected see every it's all the same physics when george kubin in 1975 says jack the cia wants
to know one how does consciousness work two how did the flying sources fly it's the it's janet
it's the two sides and it's like janice you know the janice the gestalt shift it's the same physics
two two aspects say it's duality it's what letty suskine calls er equals epr it's general
relative equals quantum mechanics i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm simplifying so are you saying that these
craft are op are operated through the mind like they think about what they're going to do and
their consciousness is directly connected to how these things propel through the universe
exactly that's what the guy that's what they told me 1953 it was a conscious it is conscious this
this is the meta material first of all is both a conscious artificial intelligence i'll call it
a quantum it's with a post quantum computer it's all built into the same architecture
nanos this is called nanotechnology you know a little lot of it's all done okay what's happening
now the chips the apple chip by my m one chip is five nanometer technology you know this is my
laptop i have a m one yeah what do you have an intel no i got the same thing you got okay so
they're coming out the m three is going to be i think two or three nanometers the m three chips
coming out in a year or two okay okay it's gonna be a lot more powerful for you guys that'll be great
because you'll need it because what you do okay and eric now the only useful thing eric davis
you know eric davis i have a fight with eric who's eric davis he's a physicist like me except
he's a second-rate physicist he didn't go to ivy league schools he didn't have that you know he
he was a military guy and they said to went to a kind of went to an arizona he went to a you know
he's but he's he's he's one of my competitors okay they're schmock then he's a schmock but he's
all right you know i could eventually all these guys eventually all the eventually we'll probably
all work together right yeah it's like donald trump talking about uh you know who's the guy the
texas ten crews remember when they were competing and then they suddenly they're working together
right right that's it'll have to happen because christopher melin and louis alizon though they
won't have any choice because the physics like that laurence livermore now saying sorry i mean
eric davis was going around saying so far he's crazy his physics doesn't work and meantime
he's pushing physics which i know how put us physics doesn't work so there's this conflict
because they're trying to get money she has a money thing follow the money okay uh but now if
laurence livermore they're gonna test so if the test works that's proof of concept then there's no
question so they're gonna have to you know ready already the fact that laurence livermore is taking
my work seriously already christopher melin if he's smart he'll come say jack i'm sorry let's shake
hands let's smoke the peace pipe and let's stop working together you know like why can't we you're
like rfk juniors as you know all right so i mean i attacked them because their assholes they've attacked
me so i attacked back 10 times worse do you think there's a plan do you think there is there's no
plan because everybody's stupid there's no plan because nobody knows what nobody nobody knows
the right hand doesn't know what the left the right that doesn't work left hand and they're
most inclusive but they don't know no physics the people in charge are stupid they pay that i mean
they're not you know when they start listening to me they'll get smart seriously there's nobody who
knows more about this than i do i mean eight could be 84 years old you need to schmooze a little bit
better now i can schmooze i mean yeah but i'm not i won't you know fuck them i don't care
i mean the russians invite me to musko yeah you didn't you say putin sent some people here to
talk to you yes yes yes twice why do you do that huh because he wants to know this technology
that why did they invite me to musko a month ago i can show you the papers
so i didn't have musko this was when obama was president before any of this war stuff you know
we were still on friendly tell you know uh oh you know hillary clinton was going to russia
hey obama went was talking to putin this is when obama was the president twice they came
and um and the first video uh a few about a few months after they come and film me and i've
putin's talking about all the stuff they i was talking to the russians on the video
about quantum teleportation and this and russia's going to get the quantum computing it's all you
know it's all and then and they came a second time okay they came a second time uh in june of
2016 during the campaign they wanted to talk about donald trump and putin what because they knew i
knew people who knew trump you know yeah yeah so uh so that was just a political thing and that's
you can see that on that's on the video you can see on rt uh no i'll i'll send you the link okay
it's on no it's uh channel five st petersburg uh which is owned by a close friend of of putin
and i was told that somebody worked they didn't say i was told basically they told me elliptically
putin monitors your stuff jack they really like what you're doing in musko and then i got invited
to musko this i didn't go this time because of the war wow all right so you know so the russians
are working the russians are working this and then um then i have this guy this this guy do you
watch history channel you don't not really okay yeah you're about the skinwalker ranch i know about
it yeah okay well you know the physicists that involve the skinwalker ranch i don't know the
physicists themselves no well anyway so any case finally i've watched i've watched episodes of it
actually i've never watched it i've only watched parts of it i've watched trevor a little bit
but uh but i guess i'm told that uh that my that a presentation about what i'm doing
is going to be given to the chief of staff of the senate select committee on intelligence
either maybe today or tomorrow or next week very soon so the so the senate they're beginning to
wise up and then there was a guy the angleton guy who you could talk to he was trying to get
he spoke to the chief of staff marco rubio because he knows marco you know the politics
and flow out of there and they were supposed to contact me they never did and this guy was a
nelson the head of nasa he said he was an astronaut once you know it's a head of nasa
they were supposed to contact they haven't yet and uh who else and then uh oh yeah and then
ron pendolfi another cia guy yeah who's ron pendolfi jeremy reese mentioned that name to me
ron pendolfi i've known him now for you know i don't know almost 25 30 years okay ronnie and i
know his brother i met his kid i know his kid and ronnie pendolfi okay he's i guess in his 50s
now maybe 60 already i'm late 50s ronnie's uncle was some high cia guy and one of the pendolfi
they're like the angletons okay not quite maybe but yeah so when ronnie went to ucla i think in
physical chemistry in like 1980 or so got his phd and his uncle pendolfi already got him say come
we want you in the cia so he rose pretty quick because he has phd you know he's a scientist
the siri so it's the science technology directorate and apparently he worked for christopher green you
heard of chris green right christopher green he's the guy with the with the dead bodies the aliens and
the guy with the blood but gary knowland giving them the you know christopher you just look you
got to do your homework there's how put off chris green these are guys i was these they're the guys
who engineered the new york times article with leslie keen i was actually with them in london
when they were doing it what yes yes chris green christopher green because yeah kit uh kit green
they call him kit green okay anyway keep going i don't want to get you off i don't want to get
you off track yeah harrell chipman it was called chip okay oh his cia name was orwell
nice you know doing operation now i like that orwell okay i don't know what and uh and uh christopher
green is kit kit green kit green yeah there was all mga ultra you know sri all this weird
weird desk so in any case it's called the weird desk and so when ron goes into the cia
he his boss is kit green at the weird desk to evaluate all this ufo and all this paranormal
stuff you know bob bigelow and all these things going on you know all this weird stuff going on
regala all this stuff and um so they're all networked so because of ron's background and also
ron at some point he's the guy or one of the guys that goes every morning to reagan and this was he
did it with reagan and bush i think and as far as i know what anybody told me clinton
and who was after clinton obama and trump
he would what are the team that would frequently i don't know i did it every day
he would go in in the morning the national intelligence estimate to the president of
united states give him the information sit there with the you know president all these presidents
pendolfi wow my understanding whether it's true i'm you know this is why
now maybe i'm a dummy maybe i don't know what i'm talking about but i'm saying this is what
i was told by okay by who by well by him and by other people okay all right so now so when
when trump was president okay so first of all the putin sends these guys they asked me
in june this is right before trump's 70th birthday he's a candidate and the russians asked me
what do i think is trump's attitude about nato what do i think it's trump's attitude to have
a lot of mere putin they want to know what i think that's it you'll see it's it's in there and um
what do i think about uh israel about syria about iran i don't know where they are i don't know i
you know but they're asking me this for some reason okay and i didn't i don't know what i said
so uh well i was talking i know this guy michael savage you know the he's like uh
you know he was like a right wing guy he's a close friend you know he's a friend of uh
he's a trump supporter and he goes to moro lago he's a yeah he's his family very well they're
billionaires they fly the private jets when they flew me to moro lago all that stuff oh yeah so so
the uh yeah so the this the obvious the russians know all this right these guys who came they know
because that was in 2011 they came in 20 yeah i came after that it was already in moro lago
so the russians monitored that they're smart i have a friend in london a friend in london
who is sandhurst you know sandhurst like the british west point and he was involved in the army
the military intelligence the british army he's the guy i have dinner with all the time
belong to a club you know with these all these guys belong to it in london and when he was and then
when he left the army he went into uh he was a special branch of the london met special branch
okay so part of his job part of his job is when you know when russians and people
international to provide security for the russians this is back this is back you know like in the
in the 90s the 80s 90s and up until recently i think and so he was telling me when he said
you know the k the old when the russian intelligence they have a word that this person
they have the term serious i don't know what is in russia but serious person
serious person the schmuck and the serious person okay the russians don't fuck around okay and this
is guy this english intelligence this english officer you know telling me this is a the russians
potent consider safari a serious person interesting okay i got this bullshit from chris melin who
who never took a physics course he didn't know what black he didn't know anything and i'm trying
explain stuff to him and he's telling he gets off telling me that don't be so sure about what you're
saying now it could be he knows what i'm saying is right and he doesn't want people to know see
there may be a legitimate reason he has or maybe they walked him into the belly of area 51 and they
showed him exactly how it works and they flew around in one of those things they're too stupid
did they know i know either that okay let me take the but let me try to be positive see one thing
okay i went to the rotc at cornell's in the rotc you know everybody had to be in the military
cornell in the 50s and one of the things in the intelligence seminar you see this is why people
are really dumb you have to get into the mind of the enemy to understand their motivations you know
be like you are the any good cop knows it's a homicide detective you get it you know get into
them a serial killer you got to think about the serial killer nobody's going to do okay anticipate
their next move yeah okay right now christopher melin is an enemy of jack sarfati cornell john
alex says enemy of jack sarfati the enemy of jack sarfati gotta come on maybe elizandro's enemy of
jack sarfati but i gotta think i don't understand why they would want to be your enemy though
but well because we can argue over donald trump that's a dumb reason that's a dumb reason but maybe
okay now i'm going to try to be uh not hostile to them i'm going to do because i look at rfk jr
who's a you know i respect rfk jr even though i may disagree with about certain things about
them vaccines i'm not sure i'm not a medical person i yeah i don't know but rfk i see rfk
jr and i can vote democrat for him but you know but i see rfk this man is a thinking man
he's a serious person he's an intellectual he's noble you know he's he's noblesse oblige
i mean his family is sacrificed and he's an intelligent man he could he's open to reason
and he's authentic he doesn't bullshit around and he's a polite man he says i will not say anything
against donal any of my uh you know my uh competitors yeah he likes to talk shit about
yeah and and i won't say that it's donald trump right okay and so you know so he's that's not who
you are though no i'm i'm like donald trump i make donald oh yeah you're you're throwing
throwing bombs everywhere i go i come out old guns blazing absolutely man i mean i'm from brooklyn
yeah new york jew from brooklyn you got jew new york jew and with the jewish mafia yet there's
right there's a lot of stuff exactly all right you know what i mean you know but you know you
got hootspa right you you fuck around with the sarfati i fuck you over 10 jobs see that's
interesting about you because you're unlike any academic in that way that's why i that's i quit
act i couldn't stand them yeah that's why i quit i quit academia 50 years ago you feel that there's
sort of like uh there's a bunch of pompous assholes i mean a lot of them are smart i don't
you know they do right a lot of right but they don't have bubbles there and you know
and a lot of them are idiots too but a lot of them aren't as you mentioned a lot of them are
communists you mentioned this briefly earlier you said that uh you said you're reading that quote
out of the book over there um that they wanted scientists who weren't afraid to speculate oh yeah
it's a CIA that's a CIA so what i see in academia and some of the most respected scientists and
people in academia that are studying this stuff is they hate to speculate they don't like to
they don't like to talk about them their their feelings on things or their opinions on things
because it can taint the science it can taint the facts yeah and also there's another reason
the real reason that's that's the public reason that's their bullshit reason real reason is that
they don't want to lose their grants right it's all yeah the real reason that every academic
i know basically no well not every but most of them they're all prostitutes they're all whores
they'll go with the money and to some extent i may be a whore too i'm not saying i'm any better than
them you know but the thing is that that's that's the way it works that's human nature
and they said that's now i gotta i'm like a catholic now you would believe in original sin
it's original sin the catholics are right right it's original sin yeah that's interesting
we're all sinners that's really interesting do you do you feel like kind of like a
an outcast of academia or an outcast of physics in general yes yeah well no i but i was i i was
an outcast by choice though by choice i couldn't i just i yeah i just said fuck you guys i'm leaving
you know and also because i had not cia said you know people were giving me money to you know
bob tobin starting with bob tobin um but okay sabah gilbert and sullivan guy you know and gilbert
and sullivan there's this opera called the pirates of penzance which is actually a pretty good opera
and so i'm like the pirate king and the pirates of penzance the story is that these these pirates
who are sinking ships and everything but what they are they're all really members of parliament
it's all satire right members of parliament who's like rebelled
and because because of the hypocrisy the hypocrisy there's a song the pirate king
if i am a pirate king and uh i sally forth to seek by prayer go forth in a in a royal way
i think a few more ships is true than a well bred pirate ought to do but many uh but many a man on
a first class throne if he wants to call his crown his own must manage to get through more dirty
work than ever i do okay this is this is a good song so i'm like the pirate king and at the end
of course the opera they all go back into the parliament they take over the country they take
over yes i'm right so listen i'm ivy league you know i'm a i'm a pumping i'm i'm white privilege
guy you know and jewish to boat i'm i'm the words are you know definitely white privilege
you want to ivy league school by privilege okay uh what else do they say about i have toxic masculinity
i'm not woke and either we're we're gonna take back the country yeah you're you're
you're radioactive to this i'm radioactive man to these i'm radioactive but to see a
male so that's the other side this is why it's easy for them to dismiss you also yes because the
communist party okay now let me explain something we were not going into politics but there's no way
to avoid it because the country look we're running on fumes the country's falling apart yeah i'll be
right here the old homeless if you go down not where i am but you go down i'm shocked how a little
homeless there is here in san francisco no no everyone was telling me how much of a dystopian
hell okay but wait no you don't understand you're right now in approval it's like futile it's like
you're right now in a privileged area of san francisco right sam altman lives right next door
to you sam altman is my next door neighbor uh uh steve jobs widow has a place up not far from here
there's all kinds of powerful people billionaires live here and and you know i mean if something
happens here if i call the cops and i say there's some yeah cops will be in two minutes right right
all right it's not that way in other but you know yeah so we're pretty um yeah i'm as i say is my as
my friend my michael carrella friend of jerry brown who's a philosophy professor at san jacob
state when i was a professor and he says when booking passage on the titanic it's best to go
first class we are on the titanic i see oh i see the hey we better we're gonna go into that glacial
man we're gonna sink yeah you know but nobody's paying attention the band that just play this
yeah they're all the stuff so whatever have you getting back to the uh the ufo stuff yeah have you
heard about what gary nolin talks about in regards to the human brain he talked specifically about
i think it's the basal glint ganglia he did some no i know okay this is gary i'm not i see i i am
okay so what what he did was he studied a huge group of people and he found out that oh yeah they
have certain structures they have certain they have extra structures in like the certain part of
their brain yeah and those people are more in tune to the ufo phenomenon yeah they were contactees
so yeah okay so you see that okay i believe okay first of all i'm not a medical person i don't know
anything about i know certain things and i know see a smart man and when we learn the phd but a
phd you don't know everything but you know when you don't know right and you know how to get information
to find out as much you know that's the talent that's what a phd level means and guys like chris
melton they don't know that louis else are they're low they're low level i mean they don't they don't
respect they don't realize that they they should respect the safari i'm like you know so but in
case uh but that's what i was telling you about walter brine in the crash i think it's a roswell
let's assume it's a roswell crash and then he claims he suddenly got superpowers so that's
consistent that they something happened they zapped him and he got these powers so probably his
okay urigella same thing happened to urigella urigella beam of light went into his head when he
was five six years old around the same time i was getting my phone calls maybe a few years
difference but and then he got the power to bend the metal he claims and then there's this guy
at the time who witnessed this was a young soldier about 19 years old israeli defense soldier
who saw this happen saw the the thing come down the orb of light and zap gala who later came out
only recently he was a general in the massade and the idf saying yes i now i didn't want to say until
i retired but he witnessed this incident with urigella okay so everything that garry nolan says
and i accept garry nolan's expertise i don't know what he knows angle that might that way a little
towards you just just grab it okay can you hear me yeah yeah we're just trying to optimize
so the answer is i support whatever garry nolan says in his field i don't know if he supports me
because he works with chris melan says anyway so gary nolan has to decide which side he's on
or he has to get the sides to come together yeah um so yeah so going back to that there's also a
connection to like paranormal shit too well that's what i'm telling you yeah so so he in his studies
it was not just people who were able to to experience or witness these ufo's it was also
the same people had more paranormal experiences like i have had like you have had well i just tell
you all this weird shit that's happening right well that's paranormal right yeah that's kind of
paranormal of course but like if you listen i don't know if you've ever heard uh bob bigelow
talk about poltergeist of course he talks about seeing like hearing poltergeist in his house and
seeing ghosts you know okay and it's not just him it's john ruby it's a cia guys john remeeris
viewing shit yeah well i remote viewing that's what the that's what hal put off and bustle talk
and then remote viewing i know some of that is is real because i experienced that with
marshal navy i was i was like literally back in ancient egypt if you were taking lsd
yes and i was there i mean it was like you know it's like spectacular vr i mean but i don't think
my brain my brain is that good i can do that but yeah it was like i was there it was mental
time travel friend allen wolf has written a book about this by the mental his experience on
the psychedelic spokasa he went you know with the shamans in south america you should read his
book he talks about it and then it's in the glaston talks about it there his trip but i actually
with marshal navy i went back i was in some ancient egyptian emerald temple emerald temple
an emerald temple wow yeah with the these like the gods of egypt the ancient gods of egypt i was
with them and they had like coming back they're like he teased you know so it could have been a
real contact and then i was also a knight's templar and i got i remember oh i got the spear i got the
spear in my leg or something like the spear on jesus or something i remember it's on the battlefield
with the spear oh and then i was also a soldier in world war two in the trenches and got killed
oh wow so these are lsd experiences wow so like i was i was like somebody else's mind okay
yeah okay so this is real and this only happened with marshal navy who's a very unusual guy
who made by using his psychic powers he died i guess in 1980 with about worth four billion dollars
which you know it's not as much as somebody's guys out but back then i think this is pre-internet
you know all this crazy stuff what what is your opinion on some of the work john mac has done oh
yeah okay oh in fact i know a kid in fact what i know this kid
these are ufo experiencers these abductees yeah i know john mac
he's a friend of mine i knew him you knew him personally yes yes he's part of the whole
way he's part of the whole thing of course of course we're all kidding what is your opinion on
everything he's done and specific like it seems like there's more 100 percent it seems like there's
more of these sightings around schools involving young young children well that's what happened to
me they want to teach us a young receptive mind so they can instill with their stuff
yeah of course the answer is yes everything john and john i believe i still think although i get a
lot of pushback i still think that john was assassinated i was with john right before he
went to london and got himself killed in san francisco here and he uh he had just come off the
caribbean was on a yacht with word of air one of the guys who had funded me this whole thing in
really yeah and he was going and you see john was also he had double life john you know got a like
a Pulitzer prize right for uh te laurenz biography laurenz of arabia laurenz of arabia okay it separate
from his and john was going went up to um i think oxford and cambridge to give a seminar on laurenz
of arabia he was getting a prize of laurenz of arabia and when he came back it was midnight
and i know the air it's this big street it's a well-lit street i mean come on it's a well-lit
street it was no traffic and this guy from czechoslovakia said he was drunk a truck a check
a you know an immigrant from czechoslovakia and a truck runs him down come on now and they said
you know they said he looked the wrong way he said looked the wrong but which happens but
this is a broadly like a boulevard bright lights that he was right across the street
so even a truck could have seen him a mile away the guy said he was drunk he was he but this
this was an assassination because i'm pretty sure and i don't care what his family
about that these assholes tell me no don't say that i'll say i think he was assassinated
because he was involved in intelligence operations john the old days harvard these are all part of
the cia stuff so god oh yeah he was and he was involved something with the islamist you know
revolution and things going on around that time so so i think he was he was hit also i have another
friend who was in the french intelligence who was assassinated in the same way that harrell chipman
was the guy from the french intelligence uh john raisa nadal who i knew and who was actually working
with françois truffaut transfer truffaut who played the french scientist who plays
françois truffaut plays jack valet in close encounters of the very kind where i got valet
into the hollywood connection through the party that francis coppola gave at his house in 1976
with spielberg and all these guys the kennis all these guys were there and that's how he connected
and uh but françois truffaut was involved in an intelligence operation with my french friend
john nadal who was i knew in san francisco and i'm not going to go into everything he was working
for the french cia and he had found some stuff connected with people and you know maybe the russians
i know something he had found out oh yeah there was they were going to assassinate this is 1977
there was a plot to assassinate nelson rockefella who was still alive who rockefella died it's
and there was some the union there was all the kind of stuff any case he and truffaut knew about it
and this was when we were up oh this was when we were up in the apartment i still had the apartment
opposite that laurence rockefella was paying for our pcrg apartment it's an hippie state physics
and john is up there and john says he feels his life is in danger this information
and he says if something happens to me and he's holding my arm he says if something happens to be
he please you know investigate it a year goes by i get somehow somebody tells me oh my french
friend another french friend of mine michelle my friend michelle whose father was a general of
french army he's like yeah i hang out with all these guys and he says uh john nadal is being
buried in peril a shea cemetery sudden cancer yeah it's a little polonium i'm sure it was polonium
poisoning yeah he was killed the same way herald chipman was killed france whatrufo
died suddenly not too long after just look and see how wentrufo died okay so there so yeah guys get
whacked have gotten whacked and this fits right in what grouch is saying too that member david
grouch is talking about yeah of course yeah yeah yeah yeah so i don't know what did he say about
people getting whacked well i don't know because i you heard but i he didn't say much because he
can't say but i don't know was he implying it's a cia killing people or his own guys killing them
or the right who knows who i don't know what do you think about what he said about there's actual
bodies that we have possession of bodies yeah well i know that i mean that's what that's what you
know it well i i don't know it for sure i haven't seen the bodies but i know it from uh because i
believe what colonel corso said colonel corso said he said and other people said i i don't know that
direct i haven't seen it myself but kit green basically says it so i believe kit green i know
kit green do you think they're planning on disclosing it to the public eventually or do you
think they're just gonna hide it already been disclosed right now this just that's what the
war is about now right it's reality war it's reality it's a reality reality it's a war i call
reality war right yeah we don't know what's real this deep fakes what you could do with the you
know deep fakes that you can have anybody saying anything they want yeah okay so
i am a reality man i am a puppet master to some extent because of my intellect and because of my
education seriously and i could you know i'm i see big pictures i'm putting together and there
i'm giving you my narrative right okay like okay what we are we're still cavemen we're back
in the cave we're on the campfire right up scouts we're telling you we're telling you
so at the market at the company you know the bookie man's going to come in but we're still
though we're like apes we're intelligent we're still sitting around everything depends on stories
we've all been sold stories i'm giving you my story i'm shaping an narrative the sarfati narrative
what reality is you could take it or leave it of course i could be wrong there's what's
called uncertain knowledge all we can do is take pieces of information and then we try what's called
oh in artificial intelligence there's a landscape and you optimization this is what the computer
this is what ai what sam altman's algorithms are doing i'm like an algorithm you're an
out we're all algorithms but we're conscious algorithms and we're doing exactly what it is
you know we're trying to optimize we have all these pieces of information any piece by itself
is very uncertain and we're trying to make a coherent story out i'm giving you the sarfati
story which i think and i could be wrong and i'm willing as new information comes in i changed
my story i adapt to new information i weigh it it's called bayesian uh uh probability that's
very good putting in yeah and that's i'm giving you what i think is the best optimum fit to all
the data that i have what is the best storyline what's the best narrative to get a coherent
understanding of reality now if somebody else i welcome anybody to come and you tell me your
story of these events you tell me get this guy nick west he thinks he knows yeah he's a schmuck
all he does is look at at the uh at the the fravoa video the tic tac video yeah okay i don't
care he may be right about that i don't give a damn what that video is real or not that's one
little piece of data over a vast thing of data and we could throw that out and there's still plenty
of convincing information right okay that fits plus i have the physics to explain it see that's
what i have that they don't have they're still thinking things going through air and stuff like
that they don't know what about the idea that a lot of these ufo's are living under the oceans
oh yeah i don't know if it's true you know i gotta be careful now i have to be very careful now
i'm like david grush because i've been told classified information not from the american
government from a different government i've been told classified information where if i say too much
i gotta be very careful that a guy i work with you getting a lot of trouble i'm so i'm like david
grush in this thing i'm in the same position grush is in to kind of be you know just real
not that i would maybe i would get in trouble too i don't know but the answer is yes i know for
sure i have all kinds of details and i even know where in one case but i don't want to go into it
because until he this guy decides to come public uh the answer is yes i know a tremendous amount
about it and the answer is yes yes yes yes 500 miles yeah yeah a lot in fact most of maybe the
they're based yeah they come yeah they they definitely and uh you know very very much so
and i have privy information what government that give it away can you tell me what government
it's not is it not the us or is it all i can say it's not the us it's not the us that's it that's
all i'm gonna say all right so it's israel well i didn't say that
is this a program that is controlled by human beings
yeah yeah he's a military a military oh it's a military program military program and yeah
this guy who's trying to figure it out reverse engineer it yeah he had it every day
who's there they go in every day to work with this so these things that are underwater
are military things no i didn't i did not i want military they're not our military no no no no
we're talking about et we're talking about not any we're talking about et's we're talking about
same thing grush is talking about okay okay talking about talking about the same thing
phil corso and rick dony talking about rick dony if you go look at my somebody's stuff rick dony rick
dony air force intelligence yeah um has a chat you know people don't like him but i like him
and uh rick dony talks about the same machine kind of machine that phil corso talks about
that my guy worked on may not be the same kind of machine but i'm not saying it's the actual
same machine same kind of machine my guy worked on that's identical okay and um and the machine
is real and uh and it was uh this was at a u.s. or actually it's a u.s. military base i know where
that base is i don't think the machine the machine may not be there now because it was years ago
but i have a good guess where it is now at least what one of these machines are now which i cannot
say is this machine recovered or is this machine intact it's operational it wasn't reverse engineered
it was recovered yeah no this is uh this is an actual machine this is uh yeah i don't know how
they got this this one maybe it's a roswell you know something else something else landed
was led they said they found it remember what gruesome somebody did like 12 or 30 of them
they're a bunch of them going back to the 30s yeah those are that's italy that's my italian friends
right they have they have the access to all those records of the musselini records
speaking of dodie i was just watching i just watched my first ever the guy you punched in
the face or almost punched in the face oh steven greer steven greer i didn't punch him i
i was we're getting to the point he would have killed me he's big he's muskin i'm the little
jewish schmuck he's yeah he's like charles and i mean he's he's he's like the hulk he's you know
he's he's on steroids yeah i see on steroids i he probably he looked like he was and he's goofy
yeah that would explain a lot would it um so he in one of his documentaries uh i was watching on
youtube yeah he was asking richard dodie about false flag operations and richard dodie's like i
can't talk about that that's too classified yeah no there are false flag operations latest one was
january 6 but i won't get into it so when it comes to ufo stuff yeah the false there are a lot of
false flags sure what's the point of that well i don't know you're asking me stuff that i don't
yeah as a physicist i don't really care there's a lot of stupid schmucks who in the intelligence
agency they're idiots like john brennan you know these we have these incompetent idiots who never
should have gotten there some of the communist moles like james jesus england and they have all
seen you know we can't handle it whatever they whatever reasons they have some of them because
they were working maybe for the soviet intelligence they didn't want us to know who the hell knows
people have different motives for being idiots and for keeping the truth yeah what does rfk say
say rfk jr says you know there's there's a lot of evil people stupid people and they have different
motives for being evil and keeping the truth from from the public right now we're being kept
from the truth it's like orwell right 1984 i see stuff and i yeah i'm a subscriber to the
london times the new york times i see stuff what they're saying and then i see stuff from
intelligence people i know it's just opposite you know the london times right they say oh
you know ukraine's winning ukraine's winning you look at the map ukraine's not winning everything
you know you know all this stuff i mean that's just the opposite that's a crazy thing about about
the media i have i have firsthand knowledge of of an example of the new york i don't know if it was
the new york times or one of the big it was one of the top two three biggest newspapers in the
country a friend of mine jack murphy who's an x army ranger yeah he's now a journalist and he
reports on different sort of like military stories kind of like kind of like the subculture of the
military and reports on corruption and stuff he's based in new york he was working on a big story
for over a year about about this cia using a nato proxy spy service to to do sabotage
operations in russia blow up railroad tracks burn down ammunition warehouses and stuff like that
Nord Stream pipeline that wasn't part of this but this was yeah but this was it was before that it
was sabotage operations where where the cia would not be legally allowed to be doing that yeah and so
they're using a nato ally um so this big article that he wrote this big story many years ago was this
this was this past year or this was 2022 rather last year so it could have been uh the pipeline
what was the pipeline was that just now recently pipeline the pipeline was also i think last year
yeah i no maybe it's just beginning of 20 i think it was 2022 with the pipeline the beginning of
2022 well they did the pipeline too so maybe anyways the point is he was getting ready to
publish this big story with one of these top three um newspapers in the u.s and right before they
pressed the button his editor at that newspaper said hey we got to get on the call with a cia deputy
director yeah of course and he got a three-way call with the deputy director of the cia and
he said uh no this is we this is completely false he's like uh this is not uh this is not true
whatever we don't want to believe so so he said we're not gonna work we can't verify this at all
so he said okay that's fine we'll put it we'll put it they call that there was a a book about that
there's a movie about it too of what they call that when they crush a story there's a term well
here's what happened okay he said okay fine we're just gonna put that in a footnote of the story
that you denied all this stuff he said it's that you said it's false right so it was like great they
got off the phone whatever um they hung up the phone the story never got published he called his
editor at that newspaper the next day he's like what's the deal like uh we're not gonna publish the
story they he because the deputy director of the cia has an off-the-record agreement so if they
don't agree with it it just doesn't get published yeah so it's bullshit it's crazy no it's not great
we're living in a banana republic there is no real freedom in america anymore we are no different
from russia except we're a little more subtle and it's we're getting less subtle about the
binds are getting unsubtle well i mean technically it's not like he didn't have the freedom and he
was able to self publish in his own website it's just the that yeah publisher website right exactly
yeah exactly yeah it's a it's a it's a form of suppression yeah they're suppressing the information
and yeah we're living and it's getting worse we're losing our constitution the bill of rights
we're losing it but rfk jr rfk jr says look they're doing it to him yeah so i i mean i would definitely
if if trump is eliminated looks like he will be there with all this i don't know i think this
stuff all this these indictments i think these are are helping him well it'll help yeah but the
point is they may also rig the election you know that we don't know that you know with that there's
ways to when i say rig the election they can also not just changing the votes and fake votes
but through the algorithms of google and stuff like that you know like they suppress the information
a hundred laps right right things like that right you know and through the media and through all
i see the times radio in uk london and i'm a subscriber and i used to read it i still read
it for other things but they're giving totally opposite picture from what colonel migrager and
other people i know are saying and then you look at the map there's an objective you can see
institute for the study of war which is i think a british think tank i'm not sure maybe it's
swashin and they show you know the the front line and they show what's being contested you know like
how much russia has what what what the ukrainians are trying to have and you see they haven't since
the beginning of the offensive they haven't done anything but they've they killed the hundreds
you know i don't know how many tens of thousands of ukrainian soldiers it's a meat grinder right
it is yeah it really is you know so it's it's terrible it's all because biden got bribed by
ola kloxer gave a hundred millions of dollars because the country we're falling apart if you
want to keep your funding you better shut up about politics jack well yeah no but that's here
that doesn't that doesn't right actually seems that my funders like what i'm doing that we got
there right okay well good you don't have to worry about being a scientific prostitute
no but but of course the enemy they could they could let me you know it can't hit by a car right
right i mean you know so i don't want that to happen so well you know hey i'm right now i'm 84
gonna be a ksara sarah maybe the sub maybe they're protecting me too i hope so yeah you try to kill
safari you could zap by your phone are you familiar with what eric winstein said recently
about he was talking a lot about ed witton and he was saying that people like ed witton aren't
even within striking distance of this anti-gravity technology and and eric's opinion was that this
whole tic-tac thing and all these congressional hearings are smoke screen yeah because eric's an
idiot eric okay and i and eric yeah he's he's angry with me now because i told him he was an
idiot i didn't say in somebody no eric's a smart guy eric is what einstein called an intelligent
fool okay i know i grew up where eric saw my life eric he's he's he's he's he's a very smart jewish
guy like a rabbi he's got kind of avatars he's got kind of avatars you know and he's hangs out with
you know with all these with ellen muskray and lexfried he's part of that little peter teal
peter teal and he hangs out and he and they respect him but the you know he's smart i know
people who have known pretty well and his theory is no good he has this geometric unity theory
you know it's math he's a mathematician trying to do physics he's very smart but he has no physical
intuition and he's like louis ellisander with a phd now i'm willing to debate him any time you
know he has these seven time dimensions and this and that and uh it's but what he says about eric
about uh witton is true witton doesn't have a clue because witton's not interested but i don't
think witton you know his father was interested but louis witton was part of that wheeler group
you know right but i don't think ed is and and ed witt okay and then uh
ed witton to eric weinstein it's like god he's so but actually ed i don't see why everybody
thinks ed witton is so great i mean he's done he's a mathematician he's done some you know
but he hasn't done there's no physics there he hasn't predicted anything to be tested
so it's a false idol eric as far as i could see you know and i could be wrong
but ed witton is like the the golden calf what did the eric davis worshiping the golden calf
what is what has ed witton done that has affected technology that has led to an experiment that
could be papa falsified like what i have here you know they're testing an equation here and it's
either gonna work or not work it could be papa falsified so from what i can see is that ed witton
has done some very beautiful mathematical art but it's conceptual art there's no i don't see any
physics there it's a nothing burger in terms of physics interesting now i could be wrong and i would
love if ed witton wants to come on with you and if eric davis want to come out and if they want to
teach me why see if i'm wrong it's dynamin huh eric whatever his name you were saying davis yeah
yeah okay i got eric davis on the way so the thing is uh now that would be very interesting
maybe come on and and uh tell me what what is it that i'm missing and if i'm wrong i i have no
problem saying wrong okay guys you're right now i adapt right so what was going on in the 50s with
his dad lewis witton when he was studying anti-gravity and everything all of a sudden i don't
there was skydavis everything went dark out of nowhere yeah no the point because they failed they
didn't do anything because you want to know if they succeeded i know i'd buy no wheeler i don't
kip thorn would know all these guys but the guys right now if we had this stuff back in the 50s
we'd be flying it around now why are we flying why are we spending money on jets well maybe these
things are ours no they're not ours definitely not ours that's clear that's uh don't even say that
that's kind of there's no way that ryan graves uh that grush and all these navy pilots that they're
that at this point 20 years later if it was ours we would be okay and if it was russia's
potent would be using it in ukraine right now are you kidding but if it was ours why wouldn't
we test it against our most elite navy fighters yeah but the why are we using it how do you
know we're not using it we're not using there's footage of them over in the middle east yeah but
they're not well no they we'd use it it would come out the congress doesn't know who provides the
money it's not ours right but some of these companies like the tell institute now they're all stupid
you gotta understand they're all engineers they're smart what they do they don't understand what
i'm talking about they don't understand general relativity they don't understand it they know
the mathematics see there's a thing they're different layers there are plenty of guys who
have done good work in the theory in the mathematics general activity that they don't
understand the physics behind what they're doing they can't relate their math really to physics
because they don't really understand it okay that's why they haven't done anything now i could i would
love to be proved wrong but i don't think i'm wrong you know i have enough experience i sort of
know how things work we don't have it if we had it after 70 years we'd be using the dam that we
wouldn't be spending you know almost a trillion dollars a year on obsolete military technology
which is no good maybe we would because if we would if we are see somebody then all these 44
four star generals all these secretaries defense they should all be court-martialed their pensions
taken away and tried for treason because they've been keeping the real stuff from the you know
jeopardizing the defense of the united states and i'll tell you one thing if putin had it he
wouldn't keep it secret you know why they don't why the fuck what they invite me to moscow if they
had it why they need me for they don't have it there's the proof i mean you gotta you know i have
a little like they're they're they're a little common sense they don't have it nobody has it
except i may have it i have some of it i certainly have some of it okay and i'm the only one who has
it and i'd love somebody to prove me wrong show me you know so and and and eric wineside he's what
he's a big poo ball with lex freedman and they elin musk was kind of a schmuck to smile i mean
i like elin but he's a schmuck elin but he's putting all his money into rockets and he's going
a little bit crazy he's a little bit of sugar you know when he talks on the street sounds worse
than trump whatever was you know he's gonna be boxing uh mark sucker and why do you want to
box i'm in box like a box a little would you box erin's what eric wonstein no i'm 84 years old i can't
have i am yeah if i was maybe 24 i would that's stupid you know they're stupid there's they're
smart in many ways but they're stupid in many other ways okay and that's why i'm saying sarfati
space corporation is going to kick the a s of space x because we're going to show that every
then you should use the graphics now we're going to show that all the rocket technology
that space x is using it's brilliant engineering great you know the thing comes down that's but
we don't need any of that it's dumb it's you know it's it's you want to get to mars like crawling
on your knees to get to mars we'll get to mars in what half hour we'll get to mars you step through
the warp to the warp drive yeah if you get there and maybe through a wormhole you may just step
through the doorway like like a like in uh doctor who and you wind up here on mars how do we go
through a wormhole we just walk through it buddy you go through you walk through it how do we make
one well how do we make what that's what we're that's that's what the experiment
yeah i want to put speed to put speed bumps that's that's sam and his Lamborghini no no no
that's that's some some asshole in a motorcycle but the point is this that the the experiment
that they're going to do at lawns live a more testing that equation is the first step toward
making a wormhole if that works then we you know we we now if it doesn't work we have to go back
to the drawing board see why it didn't work so that's called it's manipulating the fabric of
spacetime anything you you you know you warp you change the shape of the gravitational
fissure but it's a wormhole so they're going at Lawrence Livermore they're going to test your
equation yeah they test one of the you go they're testing one version there's a simplified toy model
they're not testing the general theory they're testing a particular uh application of the general
theory based on certain assumptions that are very simple for a homogeneous plasma for simple
it's not a metamaterial metamaterial is more complicated metamaterial you know is not homogeneous
is not isotropic and it's changing time this is for a plasma heavy ion plasma you read the paper
and they're testing it to see if it works there okay okay and if it works then it's a sufficient
proof of concept if it doesn't work it's not good but it's also we've learned some that that that
particular application of the general theory is the wrong way to go at least it doesn't work for a
plasma okay okay so they've tested some of it now what they're testing they got this huge machine
and they got these beams of heavy ions they're smashing them together in a like a tenth of a
millionth of a cubic meter a tiny little volume bubble and they're going to create a gravitational
field that's 16 000 times the earth's in other words you would weigh if you were in the little guy
in the bubble your weight would be 16 000 times your earth weight wow 16 000 what would that do to
time well that's a good question you know but um and uh and it's going to uh yeah that's a very good
question actually it'll be a time distortion maybe i can actually thank you i'll calculate that but i
did i was i was worried about whether it would make a black hole which might be bad
haven't they already made a black hole in a lab no no no they've done what i call simulations
where they simulate it's like it's like it's a computer simulation of a black hole using
metamaterials but there's not a physical black hole this would be a physical black hole so i
check it turns out even with their tremendous energies what they're doing it's nowhere near a
black hole but it but it is 16 000 earth g and the curvature what's called the curvature is
tended to 22 times the curvature at the surface of the earth now with the earth makes a certain
curvature here it's very weak it's like turns out it's very weak but this is 10 22 powers of 10
stronger curvature according to the numbers they've got but it's still not a black hole it doesn't
make a black hole so we don't have to worry about that okay you explained a little bit about the
when we're talking about the warp drive that um we would you would need very little power
you the power supply you can do it with a shall we try your cell battery
yeah should we try okay let me let me let me see do i have hang on a minute okay can you see this
tell me if you see this yes yep do you see the hole look get hold that it's going to fall
yeah get it i don't know what happened okay hit it okay so you see this nope you got it too all right
okay this is einstein's gravity field equation okay okay and you see that thing called the capital
g divided by c to the fourth mm-hmm okay that's the coupling capital g is what's called newtons
constant of gravitation the little c in the denominator there to the fourth power that's
the vacuum speed of light okay okay now just mathematically now guys you have to know some
math the high school math if you let that c in the denominator get small okay if you let the
denominator get small then that coefficient g over c to the fourth gets bigger there's what you
know in the denominator you let the denominator go to zero eventually you go to zero that's
infinity one one over zero is infinity so in general when if you haven't been totally dumbed
down by the communist party making americans stupid oh and i want to say now math is gender
math is white privilege don't teach math because you make blacks look dumb i want the
fuck are you i mean you not out of your fucking minds yes you are you won't bastards
okay i don't even want this all right all right i know but seriously yeah they're making us stupid
russians are laughing at us yeah yeah well critical race theory bullshit you're the real
racists we're not the racists assholes all right so what the hell does this mean
well here the speed is is 300 000 300 million meters per second but the point is inside the
metamaterial it's not really the speed but it's as if the speed is being going down to zero
and since the speed is going down to zero the coefficient itself is getting big so this
is the warp field this is the gravity field you want to control oh lift it up lift it up higher
okay the g the g the big g here g mu nu that's the warp field okay okay got it okay this is the
energy we needed the power the t the big the capital t that's the energy needed okay okay so you
want to have you want to have for the tic tac to do whatever's going to do it requires a certain
amount of g okay whatever that is you keep that fixed okay you make the effective c a lot smaller
and since g is fixed and this is getting bigger the coefficient getting bigger that gets small
that's the idea this is the amount of energy you need so it's only because it's only because g
was small and c was so big that they couldn't get it to work but in the metamaterial you
can make the effective c very small and then you get the amount of g you need for a very small
amount of energy it's just math it's a it's the math of a hyperbola you get that you know and and
you see the fact that most people can't get that is why america is going down because because
we see the russians the chinese kids get it the russian kids know it for them it's nothing
but for most americans it's something and that's why we have been defeated and we're going to be
defeated can you give me a beautiful can you give me a beautiful analogy to understand that no no
this is an equi this is what the higher a little bit higher z equals x y hold it up higher z equals
x y right okay okay so you want to have z fixed so this is okay you want to have to fix z you want
to fix what you can't hear you because you're not talking to the mic okay this is the this is the
basically this is Einstein's equation in the simplest terms okay z equals x y z equals x y what is z
is the gravity field z is the gravity field is the warp field that's the propulsion field
or that you okay the tic tac warp field is z okay okay y is the energy you need base the power you
know the how much voltage okay advise the volts the power how much how big a battery you need is y
okay okay x involves that capital g over c to the fourth power the coupling that's the coupling
the transmitted so to be that's the transduction how an input y is the the voltage input and then
you know uh okay do you know ohm's law what the resistance if okay if you have a voltage
and if you increase the resistance you get a smaller current but if you if for the same voltage
but if i lower the resistance like a superconduct i get a bigger current right so the same way here
what we're doing the whole trick is with the metamaterial we're making x big z can you see this
no yeah now we can see it what the trick is you keep z fixed z is how much warp power do you want
how much warping of the spacetime do you want that's z you keep that fixed because there's a
certain amount you want to escape the earth let's say okay okay and uh y is how much voltage you
need on your on your tesla battery inside the ufo yeah how much power i mean how many you know
what are they oh kilowatts of power you know the the what do they call it you know you buy
you the battery less a certain number of miles yeah okay so that's that that that's what y is
how big a battery how big does either must have to make your battery how much range do they get in
these ufos well wait a minute first let's just get the idea okay don't ask me that so i'm just
making an analogy now you know don't take it too literally so now but an x x is the coupling that's
where the metamaterial comes in where we make x big we make x big keeping z fixed so you make x
big keeping z fixed that means y gets less right is amount of battery power ah i got it okay so
that's the idea that's the trick that's the idea warp drive so what the point is everybody all these
smart assholes like ed witton they think that you can't change x
they can't change that they say x is fixed you can't do anything about it that's why they
don't believe any of this they don't think you change x what is x again x is the coupling
of them of the voltage to the to the warp drive okay okay x okay what is x is like uh x is the
engine okay x is the engine x the engine i understand that okay so so i i okay it's like
the horsepower of the engine okay okay and why is how much gasoline you need okay how much gas
okay got it okay so the okay no no x is the efficiency of the engine the efficiency the
efficiency you know the efficiency the more efficient the engine the for the certain amount
this is like the amount of horsepower okay the horsepower is like the warp okay so so as you
make the engine more efficient you need less fuel uh to get the amount of horsepower right
or something like that you know right uh maybe that violates the energy concentrate i'm not
trying to make analogies the more you know people get it but the point is that look it's simple
mathematics as z is fixed you make x big for z fixed y gets small okay there's a graph it's called
a hyperbola okay let me just draw a graph this is x and this is y i'll make it red and this is called
this is z fixed this is it man this is it so a little higher this is this is for fixy that
red curve is called the curve of hyperbola okay you can see which way so when x is getting small
what does it mean for x to get small x to get small you're moving toward the origin that's this
zero right uh x is getting small so it goes x and and y is going up there
y is the uh or the other way around i have the other fix it okay yeah yeah yeah i wanted to go
the other way around i want uh okay no i'm sorry no x it's x starts off small i gotta just exit
x starts off here and x is going there so y is getting small y's amount is the amount of energy
you need okay that's it so this is you know that's basically this curve it's the curve hyperbola
that's it curve hyperbola yeah this is hyperbola see now this is i want to tell you something
in russia and in china even in they used to be i don't know if in france the kids learn this when
they're 10 years old the 10 year old kid your your kid should be knowing this by now by the time
11 or 12 for sure okay okay and the fact that most americans don't know this is why we're going under
this is the biggest national security threat is that the average american kid like you guys who
are pretty smart don't know basic mathematics and and that's why the the congress doesn't know it
the burn who the heavens that the oh okay the the cia director now is a phd in physics actually
who oh yeah who's the cia director right now that woman i forgot her name is it a woman right
now it's a woman yeah and she's a phd in physics though she's after so she she may already understand
this you know i don't know and maybe she's keeping secret but she should you know she could understand
this in two seconds who is the current cia director the current will william burns is the
current cia director okay no oh no the dci the national intelligence director okay who's that's
that a woman check out those what's it called dci director the national intelligence director at
national intelligence national intelligence directorate or something yeah she's like the boss
you know the senate the oh yeah avril hains avril hains she's a p look at her she's a phd in physics
oh wow okay so avril hains should be calling jack so far in the goddamn telephone jack sorry
you know let's do a zoom and we'll have a discussion right and who avril hains knows
ron pedophiles to work for these people so this is all they should do this yeah stop being stupid
in meantime the russians want me to go to Moscow right you want the russians to get it
schmucks and it's all i blame chris melin because chris melin was assistant secretary
for intelligence at the pentagon because he was boy because he was a melin because of yeah you
know and and and melin should have told him this melin should have told him this he is not doing
his job right so that's the problem that's the problem the problem is and we see it what's
happening in ukraine you know everything everything we're doing is stupid we have open borders so
now what's happening with the open borders we have chinese communists iranian and god knows
the north korean special forces sleeper cells all the young guys these are military age men
coming through and they're ready and they get the order bang what happens they blow up hoover dam
they you know they they they blow up our nuclear reactors they incapacitate our uh uh energy
generator refoil refineries and we're dead in the water we have no we have no home defense now
well there's no home defense they can they they can take us over any time
well didn't you say we have that biodome that blocks all the nukes no we don't have i want to
make it we don't have it that's what that's what they they're hoping and i'm not sure we can make it
i think maybe we can because because the tic-tacs have it we have some evidence anecdotal the tic-tacs
have this thing they have a force field yeah they they could they could bounce they try to shoot it
down with missiles and it bounces off they try to shoot it they try to shoot the tic-tac with
missiles on the saw or the ui the ui the stuff coming out of the water yeah they tried to shoot
it down what you know who tried to shoot it well i can't tell you that the guys who tell me you
know that my guy i'm getting trouble i don't want to get him in trouble and what happened to the
the what would they shot rockets at it yeah what happened to the rockets as they bounce back or they
nothing happens they can't get through it well they even have to think when they have to see ufo
and they take a settle in torches and they try to they can't they can't dent it even until
they can't dent it when it wants until mentally if if it likes your brain waves it'll obey your
commands really yeah that's the people can consciously tap into them what people can
consciously tap into them that's the only way you can't say when they're controlled because
they're conscious they're alive in a sense they're artificial life there are they are post-quantum
artificial uh living uh conscious intelligence they are chat ai oh they are
what's happening but what might what's our fighting corp is going to do if we're successful
if we get you know we may not we may not think they may what's our fighting corp is going to do
you have an iphone in which the ai is a conscious ai
it's going to be as conscious you are maybe maybe not quite as good maybe like a dog is
a you know dogs are conscious yeah but but it'll be able to talk a dog can't talk a dog has emotional
conscious just like us maybe better than us you know the dolphins they all have it you know it's
all right because i know we understand the physics of it we have to resolve the physics of it we
understand how to do it you know with nanotechnology that's what we're going to do here it's our fatty
space corp um and so the point and you can get into your tesla car i don't like electric cars
that's bullshit i'm going to i'm going to get into my e e-pace jaguar like 2030 e-pace jaguar
and it's going to have a conscious say you know let's say uh jack what do you want to go
in a beautiful english lady's voice like they have a nail but except that it's going to be much
smarter than this you know than what they have now because what they have now is a zombie
it's not conscious right right but they're also gonna have but we also have to worry because
you have conscious robots it's going to be like blade runner you can't tell the difference you
can have deep fake people you know and there can be some problems there but you know the science
fiction you know blade runner and all that stuff what are your thoughts on what michu kaku says
about the multiverse where he says there's i i'm open-minded to it i know me i've met michu kaku
we discussed fly he's into flying sources yes yes and he's a visually a smart guy
and very good communicator a great communicator yes and whatever michu says you take seriously
he's ah as they say in the kgb the michu kaku a serious person there's some drinks of vodka
i drink vodka with michu kaku he's a serious person
so yeah have you ever talked to him what what is yeah i had i was in a bar with him in Santa Fe
and we spent like an hour drinking he was telling me about the the uh this is uh this is what i got
into the fight almost got into the fight with steve gris steve was michio was there oh wow and
after and somewhere in Santa Fe this hotel in Santa Fe New Mexico and he was we were sitting down at
the bar you know drinking you know uh and uh and he said he's investigated the j al you know he's
he's a japanese america and so he was interested in the j al thing and he said everything is real
he investigated it it's real it happened as far as he's concerned what is the j al that's the the
close encounter of this uh japan air you know airline with this flying saucer i don't know that
i forgot the details but back you know 20 years ago this was oh really yeah oh yeah just look
on there just so just you know google uh michio kaku j al ufo flying saucer right and and so
so he's you know he's he's not even skeptical about it anymore
yeah i've heard him talk about this uh and i've heard him mention um like the concept of avatars
yes well there's movie avatar well that's what i'm talking about right you know see that's the
other thing ah see the big thing i should have because all these silicon valley young billionaire
your generation assholes you know they got billions of yeah they bought oh sam altman's
one of them yeah next to him so they want to live forever they want to live forever
safari space corporation has a chance of showing them how to live forever because the cia
george kubin 1975 says jack we want to know how consciousness works so let's call the hard problem
tom stop and wrote a play called the hard problem at this point david charm is a scientific
americans philosopher they all pussy foot around now i solved the hard problem back even 20 years
ago it was one of the first i first okay c i said two problems how do consciousness work
and how the ufo's fly i basically solved the hard problem back in the mid 1990s
you know people are stupid they don't get it finally two years a year last year a year ago
there's this guy pavo pilkin who's now he's a respectable uh cognitive site it's kind of
biophysics guy philosopher of sa uh kind yeah he's he gets grants from the fetza foundation
you know he's part of the in-crowd the kind of it was steward hammer off and all this yeah he's
he's a mensch he's a serious person according to the establishment okay and he is a Finnish guy
he's a professor in Helsinki and in sweden okay and he published a paper in december of 22
on the brain as a quantum measuring device and section seven of that paper in a very
respectful peer reviewed journal is the sarfati theory of the mind matter consciousness interaction
and he basically says it's the only thing i am the only theory in town that explains nobody
even else comes close i explain using bomean physics you know it's all in there okay and
just like these guys at law so okay and then it took me only at 2011 basically 2011 i basically
solved the ufo warp drive low energy problem and i gave a talk i was working with these guys
creon levin larry lemke who works with uh with you know now with joc valet and gary noland and uh
i was i was uh general pete warden who's the head of uh of nasa aims back then in 2010 2011
he had retired from the same he was a he's he's the air force general brigadier general who ran
the space command he has a phd in astrophysics from university of arizona so he's a smart guy
and then he took and my uh a kind of informal this guy creon levin who's now the research director
planet corp they do these satellites for the cia small you know they do like space x uh what no
sky what what does elin must have that sky thing all these little satellites they do stuff like
that maybe the internet yeah oh they you know the the space surveillance will be small satellites
space surveillance yeah what starling is the internet they do like the planet score by they're
here right here it's ever planet corp it's a spin off of nasa aims the guys i i knew and they've done
this any case back in 2010 2011 there's a big meeting with darpa defense advanced projects agency
yeah nasa and what they're called a hundred year starship and general pete warden pays my advice
me to elando this october 2011 and i sort of solved the problem by then i give my basic paper
but i'm trying to explain to you guys it wasn't as good as i have it now i have it you know
things get better within time but i give the first form of it eric davis a tries to put me down
even though he believes in it i guess he was afraid that it was you know two fringe
what was fringe about it who knows you gotta ask eric davis go interview him
what do you what do you think he thought was for sure i think because he was after the money and
he knew it yeah i think uh ron paedavi calls them crooks and loons i don't know but the thing is this
sharon weinberger was there sharon weinberger is a defense journalist she writes you know and
she wrote an article about what happened this whole thing about me at this meeting and what
happened you could read the article korean levin said it and she writes about the whole thing
it's on the bbc website british broadcasting corporation so everything everything i'm saying
could be checked so i solved the problem then back then and thanks for the last 10 years i've
been improving anyway but i've been getting all this opposition from the eric davis chris melin
louis elizondo uh curtel alexander crowd mainly because of uh that they hate donald they have
trump derangement syndrome so because that they have star fighting derangement syndrome because
i was supportive of donald trump that seems to be it or they're trying to keep the real secret
secret because they don't want anybody to know but it's too late to catch that out of the bag so i
don't know why they're doing but see this is something now for you to find out you can ask
you should interview you should call up you know you're a major guy now you should call get in
touch with chris melin get in touch with john alexander get in touch with eric davis
in fact i give you a list of people they're the ones who are anti jack but there's also
ronald pendolfi project travis davis kind of project irie lemke you get jack valet you have
a panel guy just have a thing you know and all get everybody in the same or i'd zoom do a zoom
whatever the hell you want to do and let's just get it all out in the air all these guys that
you're mentioning they're all experts in different fields right obviously christopher melin he's a
politician he's a defense guy right he's a well he's not a politician he's a what is his title i don't
know what his title is okay he was he was secretary to defense right for intelligence for intelligence
yeah back during clinton right and a little bit under george bush but you know uh but but he was
yeah his if his job by definition is not to be understand physics is it well intelligence you
got to know something about but he's he's now the i'll be chris and i agree on some very core issues
chris says ufo's are real tic tac's are real machines jack safari says yes ufo's are real
machines uh chris melin says ufo's are our military threat jack safari says yes chris melin's
see ufo's military threat and elezandro agrees with him and actually put off agree eric davis we
all agree on this so on the important stuff we all agree when they start attacking me is they say
jack safari is a nutcase conspiracy kook everything you know he's a nut and his he doesn't understand
physics and his physics is wrong we got the physics what do they say specifically is a conspiracy
would you they say you're a conspiracy kook what part of about what you say well because i support
donald trump and i believe that january 6 was a it was a rip off it was a uh uh like the rice
dog that they had like because i think they have been fbi and government agitators leading it on
and and i think trump was stupid to do it in the first place he fell into their trap right you know
so and so i think it's a lot of bullshit all the indictments are bullshit you know i basically
you know i'm on that i'm on that wing i'm with matt gates and uh who is it some of the you know
some of the other guys um you know what's her name that they hate her the the girl from uh
south carolina uh the congresswoman you know who's uh green is it but whatever i i can't think of
names over and and um uh oh well that's actually what took across and you know all these people
you know and so that's why so that's it's part of the political the civil war civil war going on
yeah no it's uh that's you're basically just giving them an easy excuse to dismiss you
yes by talking about all that yes because i'm not going to compromise i'm not going to pretend
no matter what no matter what's true they're going to be able to justify that because exactly
half of the country and i'm not like for a while i supported what's it of sanchez uh sanctimonious
he calls up because he's good governor ronda sanctimonious ronda ronda your governor and
your governor comes off this is entering and he says at one point early he says uh we shouldn't
be giving money to ukraine ukraine's lost the war it's a you know stupid stupid strategy
and then because this is kernel uh uh douglas mcgovern talking he says then one of a uh sanctimonious
is uh donors a big donor that calls him up and the next two days later sanctum he does a 180
because in other words because the money right you see see these are these are just politicians
he's about dead just going the script of their dough these aren't just good these aren't good
people who want to make the country better these are no that's right but rfk jr and i support trump
but i would support rfk jr is the real thing okay i may not agree with everything he says
on certain things which i'm not you know but he is authentic and he is honest and he's not
bullshitting he's not lying about anything he believes he's you can and that's why i support
trump sir trump has done yeah because trump says what's on his mind he doesn't bullshit around he
says what buddy but you know he acts on he did what he said he was going to do he doesn't get
he's like me trump is like me he's in new york he had and he has enough money he didn't go in for
the money he lost billions of dollars by doing he could have had you know enjoyed his his he's
doing this for the because he's a patriot he's going to see the country going down but he's
stupid assholes that's why he did it yeah that's the reason you know that's why i can't stop saying
as i'm a patriotic american man right yeah in the old school hmm so there it is you know and i
agree with okay one of my politics my talk is the same as douglas migrega rey mcgoverns scott ridder
scott ridder got some some trouble but doesn't matter he's a smart guy and there's a couple of other
guys uh that uh there's a judge diapolitano tucker carlson basically michael savage who's a
personal friend you know yeah and um and that's it and rfk jr hey i think if i i think if
if trump survives all this you know the Stalinist show trials 1936 banana republic
you know uh treason that that that that they're doing in new york and and jack smith that asshole
and all of them you know if he survives this and if he and rfk if rk guy went in as vice president
they'd have a winning ticket well as far as the indictments i mean i don't want to like turn this
into a political podcast but the the indictments it seems like the georgia ones kind of uh that's
kind of a straight shot for them because they have like the recorded conversations with them
them and i don't know what they have they have some pretty damning evidence have you heard it i
haven't yeah i've i've heard people talk i can't remember it i can't recall it right now but sort
of why did you hear them say that they do what they would like yes yeah basically that either it was
the guys that were working for him or trump there said something about there was a quote he said find
the votes oh no but that's oh no no no they're not gonna they'll win on that no no oh no that's
bullshit that's all if you just find the votes yeah that's bullshit that's like saying that is
total crap that's a ass oh i even i i'm not even a lot i could defend him on that yeah and he said
fine he meant by that he believed that's not lying that's he meant that there were phony votes and
there were real votes they haven't counted properly they by find the votes he means weed out the
illegitimate votes the phony votes with the you know they he's talking about find real legal
votes okay let me tell you something i have people i've a friend guy worked with a physicist down
orange county okay and they voted and and and then some of their friends they're republican you know
they voted republican and their votes were lost they lost they were disenfranchised in the 2020
election in the 2020 they were disenfranchised i know my vote doesn't count here i i don't i don't
i've lost my vote because they have all this bullshit thing about this graded thing you know
you know i'm a phd theoretical visitor with IQ and god knows what and i can't figure i mean i'm not
interested you know i want to know you know what i'm saying and i can't figure the thing out so
what are all the dummies they don't know what the fuck is going on right so they we don't have any
voting here in san francisco for locals i can vote you know i can vote for the uh you know for for
trump or for so somebody or for rfk jr but then they they still you know i mean so we don't have
any votes california is a uh one party rigged election state we have no voting rights i'm my
civil rights have been by over a long time there's nothing you know but why don't you move to florida
what why don't you move to for now because i can't stand the weather i know i'm a beautiful wedding
here you kidding look where i'm living so you'd rather you give up some freedom for good weather
yes
and also i'm in london you know almost half a year okay half the year wow okay well that's been
for me i mean i plan to spend money if you know part of if this thing comes through we have a
london branch london company uh and um and my my my my better half is british citizen
hmm and we have a you know i belong to a british club if they don't throw me out for
ballad players because they're all pro ugrade and i'm not but but whatever i'm with this very
exclusive club and you know the club world you know and um and um and i just like london you know i
mean i'm you know have you been to london i've never been to london and you guys if you have the
money if you want to do maybe come over to london for a couple it's not that far from
florida play over to london yeah for a couple of days and let's see we can walk around you know
as long as i don't look the wrong way when i'm crossing the street like john mac yeah yeah yeah
right no no london is great london is still and even even england is going downhill also
some of the they have some of the same problems we have yeah but yeah but still the londoners are
just you know they're just uh more in general and i'm with a very elite group of you know people
in the in the theater world the government world the army the police the london my my friends
are assistant commissioner of the london met you know we have dinner and we you know and they play
rights and you're a big shot well i'm involved yeah i'm part of the you know i'm i'm integrated
behemian grove yeah london yeah right right yeah well no more behemian grove because my guy died
my guy died you know uh i could are you sure they don't do sacrifices at behemian no they don't
do anything like that is that have you seen alex jones's documentary about alex jones look i some
of these alex jones an asshole he's an asshole on the left i like some of the stuff alex jones says
you know because i'm a conspiracy nut too like it but alex jones really screwed up
you're a conspiracy nut you just made fun of chris melvin for calling you a conspiracy nut you
just called yourself i am a consumer but but but anybody who isn't a conspiracy nut it's just stupid
you gotta be stupid not to be a conspiracy nut these days because it couldn't be worse
you know everything you think is bad it's worse than you think what's the difference between a
conspiracy theory and the truth you know not much six months yeah okay right right right
so what we're talking about okay the grove okay for alex jones basically screwed up on the sandy
hook thing oh yeah big time that was dumb that was real i don't know how it could be so stupid
i like him as a personality you know i like him but uh and then he screwed up on the bohemian
grove that's stupid i've been to bohemian grove many times and it's it's just like me being in a
london club but it's a bunch of basically old guys like me okay old guys like me who are relaxing
because they they feel safe okay and then they have a few guys like you up and coming you know
and you know and hedge fund guys and you know rich a lot of them are rich and powerful you know
and like henry kissinger you know but then george bush when he was there there's this whole camp
where it's all like ropigates defense intelligence uh heads of the cia admiral's the four stars

probably not by some of the top guys you know i don't what they have against clinton no clinton
wasn't there clinton was a straight shooter i don't know maybe maybe the guys i just spoke to didn't
like well maybe they were republicans i don't know i don't know if obama's been there or not it's a
good question no but the people go to kissinger you know bloomberg bloomberg uh what are some of
