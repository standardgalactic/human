There's no civil war there.
What's made things worse, though, is sanctions.
You know, we've been sanctioned the living shit out of them, right?
Yeah.
We've sanctioned the living shit out of anybody we don't like.
Everybody.
And we've overplayed that here.
For sure.
Because now people are like, you know what?
F*** your sanctions.
And that's what China is.
We're going to go to the Chinese.
Right.
Bingo.
All our sanctions have done.
Our sanctions, combined with a 20-year global war on terror,
have allowed a competitor in the marketplace to rise up.
So now, if you don't like American financial work
or financial systems, you can choose Chinese financial systems.
If you don't like American weapons systems,
you can choose Russian or Chinese weapons systems.
If you don't like American telecommunications,
you can choose Chinese telecommunications.
If you don't like American-made vehicles,
you can choose Chinese-made vehicles.
China's done a fantastic job of getting themselves to a place
where they are a viable alternative to the United States
for development.
In every sector.
For developing nations.
Yeah.
It's not first-class, first-world stuff,
but it is absolutely good enough for the third world.
Absolutely true.
