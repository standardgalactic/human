So my parents are from the Caribbean, they're from Montserrat, which is by Antigua and they
got married in London, I was born there and then the day after, literally the day after
I was born, they had one of the, in Notting Hill, they had one of the biggest race riots
in the city.
They had a massive one, it was literally, I was born on August 22nd, that conflict was
on August 23rd and that made my parents go, okay.
Because this is the time of the Teddy Boys, you know, kind of rockabilly, rockabilly
racists.
Rockabilly racists.
Yeah, there was a whole thing like after World War II, you know, they brought in people
from India, they brought people from parts of Africa like Nigeria, they brought people
from Jamaica and other English parts of the West Indies to help rebuild London because
all of these cities have been blown up by the Blitz.
So they brought people in and quickly there were a lot of resentment from people that
were there, but they brought in folks to kind of, because, you know, the cities have been
destroyed and yeah, so it got weird.
So you guys got out of there and went to...
My parents got out, my pops said, you know what, I'm going to take a chance on America
and first we lived in Harlem for a, I don't know, maybe a month and then he said I'm going
to go to Brooklyn.
He just went to Brooklyn instead.
So Brooklyn is what I know, I grew up in Brooklyn and I didn't go, I didn't, well, you know,
it was fantastic.
I mean, when I think about it, I love it.
It was a fascinating time because, you know, I mean, I was born at the end of the 50s.
So, you know, you still saw cars from the 1930s when I was a little kid.
You still saw cars from the 40s and the 30s on the street and then all the kind of cars
with the fins, the Cadillacs with the fins, then you started seeing the muscle cars, which
is like incredible, you know, like seeing, you know, the Corvettes and seeing the Mustangs
and the Cougars and things like that.
So it was a very, it was a very dynamic time.
A lot of changes happened in a very short period of time.
Like I was a literally a child in the 60s, a little kid and the things were incredible,
you know.
Moon landing, I mean, everything, you know, I saw Jack Ruby shoot Lee Harvey Oswald on
live TV.
What?
Yeah, my parents, my parents, and my parents are young, you know, they were just in their
early 20s and what have you, and they said, that's the guy, and he was being brought in
for his arraignment.
And my dad said, you know, that's the guy that shot the president, and as soon as he
said that, you just saw this Fedora come into the frame and pop, pop, pop, and it was pandemonium.
It was freak, freaky.
So all that early media exposure had a, had a big, had a big impact on me, like seeing
civil rights protests, seeing Bocca or the dogs, the hoses, you know, that kind of really
imprinted on me.
You know, because I could, I could see, I could see who the, who the hoses were being
turned on.
Right.
And I could look at my arm and go, oops, you know, so yeah, pretty much.
But it was, it was, it was, it was an amazing time.
It was weird, cool things, you know, because of also being exposed to things that I don't,
you know, I'm a kid, right?
But seeing King Kong and Dracula and, you know, James Wales, Frankenstein, you know,
seeing all that stuff, it had a really huge impact.
That was, that was a cinema that, that really impacted me.
And how old were you when you first got into music?
You know, I was into music, I think from when I first heard it, but I didn't play an instrument
until I was a teenager.
And where was your first, the first music you got into, was it rock and roll?
First music I heard, well, the first music I heard was like Motown and British Invasion.
It was kind of almost a split between Motown, Stacks, James Brown and British Invasion bands,
and then the bands from San Francisco and things like that.
So it was like hearing, I mean, hearing BB King, hearing early rock and roll, because
they were playing, because at that time they were being played as almost, they were being
played as oldies, right?
So but for me, it's brand new, right?
After hearing, I mean, say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud, hearing Dionne Warwick.
Dionne Warwick had a huge impact on me, but you know, Bert Backer, I just, Bert Backer
just passed.
And hearing Dionne Warwick, you know, do you know the way to San Jose and anyone who had
a heart and a house is not a home, all those tunes.
It's such an incredibly, incredible voice, you know.
So how does such a legendary musician like yourself become so interested in such an expert
in artificial intelligence?
Well, I don't know if I'm that much of an expert, but I have an interest in it because
I think science fiction, science fiction in a way had a huge impact on me, as I said,
you know, horror and then science fiction.
And then we've been, we've had this kind of fascination with the idea of the supercomputer,
Colossus the Forbidden Project, Hal 9000 from 2001.
I mean, what was it, Knight Rider, the car, the car kit, you know, the car to talk to
the, you know, the car that talked, you know, you've had this fascination with it going,
and I'm probably skipping a bunch of stuff, silent running, you know, robotics, you know,
the robot from Lost in Space, you know, the robot from Forbidden Planet.
We've had a fascination with this technology going back.
I mean, much longer than that, even, you know, even folklore, it's been a thing.
So, you know, the idea of technology having a kind of life of its own, even if you think
about something like a music box, right, you know, you turn the thing and it plays a tune.
Well, a music box is a kind of sequencer, right, you know, or a player piano, you know,
or the piano, where the piano seems to play itself.
You have a roll and it automates the keys, and that was like a huge craze, the player
piano.
In fact, there was a Mexican composer, Conlon Nancarro, and you should, if you hear, if
you get a chance, listen to Conlon Nancarro's music.
He did this thing where he took piano rolls and he made impossible, impossible piano pieces.
He made these pieces for player piano that would be impossible for a human being to play.
Incredibly fast, incredibly dense, really out there, really entertaining.
And he was, you know, just a pioneer of the idea of not exactly electronics, but using
mechanical means, you know, to...
So we've had a fascination with automata for the longest time, and the idea of intelligence,
the box that speaks, and things, the oracle.
We've had, you know, a fascination with it, and now we're finally at a place.
Even think about movies.
Movies would portray computers that didn't exist.
I mean, computers that were faster and more reliable than computers were actually available,
you know?
So we've had this idea, and now, finally, we're getting to a place where not just personal
computers, but our phones, our tablets, have a lot of capabilities.
And, you know, this whole idea of the computer that could be the human being at chess.
Right.
Right?
That was a big deal.
And then it didn't stop there.
It's like, now there's a computer that beat human beings playing Go, which is a game much
more complex than chess, but, you know, the computer that beat the Jeopardy, you know?
So this whole idea has been just a fascination.
And to what end, to what, I mean, really, to what end?
And now we're starting to see things that we only saw in sci-fi books and movies.
We're starting to see those kind of things, and now it's starting to get us a little nervous.
Have you always thought deeply about this kind of stuff since you were a kid, or has
this been something?
Yeah.
Watching movies earlier?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
I mean, again, you know, I was fascinated by the moon landing.
I was fascinated.
And then turned to find out, I didn't know that, you know, they had the movie Hidden
Figures, that there were these African American female mathematicians that were, you know,
they helped, they actually were essential in plotting how the, you know, the trajectories
for the Mercury, for the space capsule, I'm saying that wrong.
But, and then I learned about Ed Dwight, you know, Ed Dwight was in the Mercury program.
There's one African American astronaut in the program, and he wasn't allowed to fly.
It's a whole thing.
He was kind of hounded out of the program by Chuck Yeager.
You think when you watch movies that the movies get their inspiration from, like, what is
real, right?
You think that when you watch something in some sort of crazy sci-fi film, people are
going into space and going into different planets, that this is all based on something
that could, that's already has potential in the real world.
But if you dig into it, it seems like there's evidence for, especially when it comes to
the Defense Department and things like that, like some of our most groundbreaking science
comes from the inspiration of, of war and global control, you know, they call it blue
sky research, where it's like, oh, here's some crazy science fiction, fantastical idea.
How could we make this a reality?
And there's people out there that are actually doing that, like doing it that way.
They're trying to get to it.
It's, it's funny.
We come up because most science fiction is actually fantasy.
Most science fiction, I mean, something like when you hear about things like an FTL drive,
which is like, you know, faster than light travel, you know, faster than the speed of
light.
So the idea of getting something the mass of a starship to travel faster than the speed
of light.
It's one of those things that is incredibly entertaining and it's wonderful to see it,
you know, we're going to go to warp speed.
It's incredible.
But if you stop and think about that for any length of time, I mean, the speed of light
is like a hard limit.
Like it took a long time for us to go faster than the speed of sound.
And to go faster than the speed of sound, I mean, there are effects like you can't do
for a sustained, like a pilot can't do it for a super sustained period.
I mean, like this, we get into the problem of G forces and the effect the G forces have
on the human body.
You know, there are real issues about, you know, we evolved on a planet with gravity.
So the idea of being in space without gravity for extended periods of time is a problem.
It's a problem.
That's why the astronauts have to use treadmills.
They have to exercise.
It's not, it's not like just about being in shape.
Literally.
In order for them to stay healthy in a weightless environment, they have to, they have to work
on their bone density.
They have to keep their muscle mass or they're just going to have problems.
So if you think about extended time periods, you know, that's going to be an issue.
The idea, the idea of cryogenic, a cryogenic change, you're going to be frozen and we'll
go fly.
It's going to be a hundred years and you're going to, and it's like, you know, I don't
know about that.
I don't know if our tissues, our little freeze in our tissues.
I don't know how this is going to work.
How's the defrost going to work?
You know what I mean?
You know how it is when the, when the, when the fish defrost at a, you know what I mean?
It's like, it's, it's, it's an actual thing that would have to be worked out and we do
nothing.
And in fact, interestingly enough, maybe the only way we're going to work out these issues,
we have to have a form of calculation, intelligence, if you will, a form of brute force calculation
that has a certain amount of creativity to do it.
We're not going to, I don't think we're just going to do it with just a bunch of smart
people figuring out the thing that's happening in a way.
And this is jumping the shark a bit about, about it's really language model, the large
language model generative AI, because people are very particular about calling it intelligence.
And there, there are many people that they hate the fact that AI is being tossed around
like that.
Because people say it's not AI.
It's not AI.
It's not general intelligence.
It's not independent.
You're talking about like the chat GPT and all that stuff.
Chat GPT.
Yeah.
But it is, what it does is it's really remarkable and it's going to become more remarkable.
See we're, the thing about the controversy around it is really about our tendency to
anthropomorphize.
We, that's what we do with our dogs and our cats.
Like we project emotions onto domestic animals all the time.
We're the, we're the, we're going to, we're the ones that fill in the gap because we're
interacting with this model and the model is predicting it, it hears input from us and
it has all, it has all of this, it's huge data set and it's drawing from remnants of
other convert, modalities of conversation, ways in which people respond.
Not actual recordings, but actually modalities of the way people respond in conversations
and it's making a response to us based on these modalities.
And then we hear that response and we react to it.
And our reaction is also training the model.
So our interactions with these large language generative modeling, I'll just say AI because
it's blah, blah, blah.
And that's, it's AI shortcut for something that's not, it's really a modeling system.
But our reactions are also training that everything that we, everything we say back
is training the model.
So the model is responding to somebody to millions of people now.
Millions of people have gotten chat GPT and other modellers and our interactions are increasing
its quote, unquote, intelligence in the sense that, oh, this is an option.
Oh, this, oh, maybe, and it's picking and choose.
You remember the Terminator and the Terminator has this, you know, he has an interaction
with a dude and he goes down the list and says, oh, fuck you asshole.
Right.
He goes down the list.
And that's, and that's, that's like the best line in the entire movie.
That's the one line.
Everybody bust out laughing because it says, okay, I got a bunch of options and he scrolls
down and it kind of humanizes this, this murderous robot.
It's this weird moment where you kind of dig the Terminator because the Terminator says
what you would say to someone that's annoying to you, right?
It goes to, and that in itself is entertaining, but it's also insidious.
Right?
Yes.
Because we're, because now the Terminator now shorts and niggers our buddy.
He's, he's the guy we go to a bar and we'll drink with him because he said, fuck you asshole.
And that's the, because we anthropomorphize, that's, we make, we make the meaning.
We make it mean something, our laughter at that moment.
And it's real.
It's genuine, right?
It's human.
It was written by somebody and wrote a script.
Oh man, it'd be funny.
He goes down, he scrolls down a list, you know, he just scrolls down a list of options and
he picks the one and that's dope, right?
At the same time, as funny as that is, it's also like this other weird thing is going
on, right?
You're taking the villain and turning him into a hero.
Right.
Right.
It's all about the interpretation, the human interpretation of, of the mechanics of what's
going on.
Because even from what I understand is that Chad GPT is basically, it's not, when you
ask it a question, it's not necessarily going to be the right question or the wrong question.
What it does is it basically scours the internet for all of the essays that have been done
on certain topics.
And it finds out what other people have written about things and sort of like regurgitates
it in its own way.
But that could be, it could easily find something that, you know, all this stuff is, it's library
of context that it pulls from is all based on what humans have done.
And it could be something that was incorrect or slightly incorrect.
Yeah.
What it makes, the thing is, so the early, so there was a Chad GPT one, there's a two,
there's three, there's 3.5 and now there's four.
So the thing that's interesting is that Chad GPT is actually, it's kind of siloed.
It, it, like Chad GPT three only had information up to 2021.
Maybe Chad GPT has 2022, but it's siloed.
It's not totally running around.
It's actually contained, it's actually kind of contained, but it makes mistakes.
It says, it says off the cuff things.
It goes off on tangents and the researchers say, oh, the, the, the model is hallucinating.
Now the thing is they don't know when it started to do that.
They were like, what's it doing?
They didn't, they, it's doing something that they know it's doing it, but they do not know
why it's doing it.
They do not know why it's, it makes stuff up.
They don't know why it makes stuff up, but it does.
The thing is Chad GPT four is an order of magnitude more accurate than Chad GPT three
point five.
I'm like what, I read something, it was like, okay, so one of the things that they do is
they have to take the model, the AI, take exams and Chad GPT three, they had to take
the bar exam and I think it failed.
I think it didn't do really yet, but Chad GPT, well three, three point five did much
better through a four, Chad GPT four passed the bar exam in the 90th percentile.
So it passed the bar exam at the top rank of where human students are.
And that's the difference between three point five and three point and four.
Right.
And, and that's a shocking, that's a shocking leap.
That's a, that's a shocking leap.
And now that's when you heard all the people go, oh, we need to slow this down.
And that's when you started hearing people say, I mean, people have been saying that
this is a, this is a very concerning thing.
But really Chad GPT four was the version of having everybody go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, because people started to see where's it, you know, where's
the upper limit.
Now maybe there's a limit, you know, some people saying, well, you know what?
There's a limit to the levels of cognition that is going to be able to achieve it.
Another people are saying, we don't really know that because it's having its own internal
conversation.
It's, it's, it's building its models based on external, external input, but it's also
having conversations with, and maybe that's why it hallucinates.
How do you think that this stuff is going to affect art and music?
Well, and things like that.
I mean, because there's, there's mid-journey, I'm sure, mid-journey is the AI artwork where
you basically input, put a bunch of inputs and describe sort of what you want this artwork
to look like, the style, the time it was made, and it creates this beautiful, captivating
art.
Yeah.
And, you know, I think about that, especially when I see people on the internet, when they
make videos, they're using this stuff to create the thumbnails for their videos, they're
using Jappi GPT to create the most compelling headlines and titles of their stuff.
Right.
I'll tell you what.
I mean, the art world, I know, I, and you know, I'm a photographer and I've done multimedia
myself, done a little bit of stop mo, stop, stop motion animation.
And even, I think that what, there was like AI Drake that people were listening to.
Oh, the AI, AI Drake is, is like the big thing.
And it was like, yeah.
More people were listening to it than, than the regular Drake for a while.
Like it was like, they were, it was creating bangers, like Drake, like amazing music.
Oh yeah.
It is Drake.
Funcanny.
Yeah.
It's very, it's very in the weekend.
It's, it's, uh, well, what's happening right now?
Okay.
When sampling came in, when sampling first came in, like the AI, S900, you know, the SP12,
you know, all those early samplers, revolutionized hip hop.
I mean, and you know, rock and roll, you know, bands like Pink Floyd have been using tapes,
King Crimson been using tapes, like the mell, the mellotron is basically a keyboard that
plays recordings of violins.
And it's got this, it's this whole nostalgic feeling because it's got these old tapes of
violins.
And when you hear it, you get this emotional feeling from it because it's like violins
from an old movie.
It's a very specific kind of thing.
And I feel for you, the Chaka Kanton came out, they incorporated a bit of Stevie Wonder
playing fingertips.
And it was like 1963 or whatever, he was like a kid, he was a kid and, and it's this incredible
moment of this nostalgia of hearing Stevie as a young kid with his voice is all high
and it's an emotional moment.
It's messing with your emotional attachments.
Yes.
Nostalgia.
Nostalgia is a thing, right?
So this is, so then it started to come out, Public Enemy, Delasole, Delasole in particular,
three feet high and rising, Prince Paul produced that.
And there was no law, there was no real legal framework.
And a lot of the artists let it go, a hall of notes and, oh man, go for it.
You know, they didn't, they didn't respond to it.
There's all kind of stuff in there.
And then the turtles, they tried to use a piece, a bit from the turtles.
The turtles said, no, no.
And that was the beginning of the legal, you know, pushback.
And that's when the whole thing about samples had to be cleared.
And you know, if you use a sample, you know, if you use a sample as part of the hook, then
the artist can say, you know, I'm a co-writer, fair enough.
So there was that.
And it actually became a situation where it became almost class-based in the sense that
the richer artists, the artist with more money, could afford to pay the bigger licenses.
They could, you know, because, yes.
So if you're, if you're in the mix and your budget is half a million, a million dollars,
you can go to a Broadway show and grab a hook and pay off the, you know, as an artist that's
broke, a backpacker, can't, can't clear that sample, right?
So it's already, the legal framework can create a tiered experience.
Like the small fry can get shut down, but if you're already in the mix, you're good
as gold.
And people gain that system, too, with record labels and lawyers that gain the system.
Like there's a lot of recent in the last couple of years, a lot of like really popular
hip-hop songs that have come out, that have sampled some older songs.
And they do, what they do is they, they, they'll see it's hitting the top charts, they'll let
it run for a couple of years, let them make a bunch of fucking money, and then hit them
with the lawsuit.
Exactly.
And there's a whole thing about, about sample forensics, loop forensics.
I mean, there's a whole corollary of people that, that's all they do is that they listen
to songs.
I remember DJ Premier got really upset.
There was a, there was a dude that was like, he had a website where he would go and he,
oh no, that break is from here.
That break is from there, you know, because, you know, people were OCD, you know, that's
OCD hip-hop fan is going to be like, I know that break, but that snare drum ain't, that
snare drum is from da-da-da-da, you know, that, oh man, that's not Stubblefield, that's
da-da-da-da-da, that's Jabbo, da-da-da-da, and they'll go back and they'll, and they'll
say, no, this is the break, that's the break, use that.
And the DJs are getting like, yo, you violate, you exposing, you know, and it's like, you
know, people go, okay, no, that was Isaac Hayes produced that, da-da-da-da, this, da-da-da-da.
Yeah.
You know, so there, so there's that.
So this thing now, so there's that, there's legal framework, and there's a kind of an
ecosystem that's established over many lawsuits and over many years, blah, blah, blah.
What's happening with this, with the voice-bottling and taking the, I don't want to say the wrong
word, that the phonemes, phonemes, phonemes, phonemes are, that's though, your voice has
a particular sound because all the, you know, those are the aspects that make your voice
unique to yourself, right?
And now the idea of modeling phonemes and being able to like, talk to a mic, you talk
into the mic, but another person's voice comes out, like that is here.
And there was a company called Liar, based in, named after the Liar Bird, Australian
Liar Bird, and the Liar Bird can imitate any sound, it's not, it's not, it's not like
a parrot, it can, it's almost like an organic tape recorder, like you play beats and you
play a track, the bird will imitate the track, it's crazy.
I mean, and people aren't quite sure how it's able to do it, but it doesn't just, it's not
like a, you know, like a talking bird that says, you know, probably want to crack or
whatever.
It actually will make the sound of the drums, and it's obviously completely organic.
So this company came up with this thing, and they did the first deep fakes, they had Obama
and whatever, and the first times you heard it, you could tell that it was almost like,
because it's kind of gated, it kind of has these dropouts, you know, it's kind of almost
like a robotic imitation of Obama, you're taking individual words and stringing them
together.
That now, that has moved so far ahead to the point where you can hear Drake and be convinced
that it's Drake.
And the other thing is, with the chat GBT-4, we're having access to, you know, it's like
everything that's on a particular record, you say, I want you to make me a rhyme that
doesn't exist, but in the style of a Drake or in the style of a Kanye, and basically
you as the human producer, you get the first one on its corny, that's whack, that's whack,
that's whack, wait a minute, that one's good, right?
Because chat GBT doesn't have an ego about it, it doesn't get upset, it doesn't get
upset.
If you say, yo, that's whack, it doesn't care, it's, oh, it just will do it, right?
As opposed to a human, like, well, you know, some could be in their feelings about, yo,
man, that rhyme is whack, it doesn't, it doesn't react like that.
In fact, each time you say the rhyme is whack, it's grateful because you're training it.
But each time you reject it, it's the almost exact opposite effect of dealing with a human
collaborator on a level.
It's not, it doesn't have an ego, it's not like, hey man, well, you know, it's not arguing
with you, it's not arguing with you.
In fact, each time you say, you know what, that's not right, it's like, oh, cool, thank
you.
Right.
So it's a, so this thing is, this happening is, we have a finite, say you wanted to, say
you want to do a Bob Dylan, a song that Bob Dylan never wrote, but you want to write a
Bob Dylan lyric.
You could say, well, you know what, I want to go from Highway 61 revisited to Nashville
Skyline.
There's a finite number of records, there's a finite number of words, there's a finite
number of subjects, it's a way, it's a finite number of whether he wrote it from the first
person or third person perspective.
So the chatbot has all of that and will mix and, you know, cut and paste and not even
do that.
You see, that's one of the things that's really weird because, see, first the first kind of
chess computing things, well, it has like a memory bank of all of the chess games, right?
And can go like that.
This is not like that.
You just tell it the rules of chess and literally what it's doing is that it's doing trial
and error, you make a move, it's not going back, it's not looking at Paul Murphy, it's
not looking, you know, at Bobby, it's not going at Bobby Fisher, it's not doing that.
What it's doing is it's trial and erroring and going, oh, try this and when you respond
it goes, okay, that, it's doing it in real time and that's the difference.
So if you make up, say, imagine this, it not only has access to, say, Bob Dylan's lyrics
from Harbor 61 Revisited to National Skyline, it can also have access to everything the
critics wrote about those records.
Right.
So it can have access to reactions to those things.
That's the thing that people got to have to grasp.
It says, okay, so how do the critics respond to that?
So it's not only taking into account the words, it's taking into account the reactions and
it can average out what was the, what was reacted to and make up a song that didn't exist,
that a critic that wrote about it would dig.
Right.
And then it presents it to you and then you go, oh, that's whack or you go, man, that's
the thing about these things.
It's the problem.
It's almost like it's what we wish we could do.
That's it.
It's not about, it's kind of, it's kind of, how can I put it?
The problem isn't when it's whack and corny.
That's not it.
It doesn't, it doesn't, and you can tell it, you'll whack your corny.
It doesn't care about that.
The issue is when you go, yo, that's dope.
That's where the issue is.
The issue is when the thing that's going to go down with artificial artists, what have
you.
It's not about when it's, when it's cheesy.
It's about when it's dope.
It's about when it is actually moving.
Years ago, there was a, there was a book, a book, back in the 80s, this has been going
on a long time.
There was a, a program called Ractor and Ractor was, and this was like a, a, a, a syntax dual
language.
It wasn't even a language model.
It was kind of like using just kind of rules of grammar and was coming up with these things.
It was kind of very, very, very random.
It didn't know, it didn't, it didn't, it wasn't contextualizing it at all.
It was just, it was just word salad.
And basically there was a book that was put out called the policeman's beard.
The policeman's beard is half constructed and it's a, it's a book of poetry by this
program, Ractor.
And I was looking at the thing and it was like, okay, some of this is just abstract.
It's nonsense.
And then there's a poem in this book that almost brought me to tears.
It was about loneliness.
It was about, it was so, I was, I had to remind myself that this was just a program speeding
out words randomly and it is, it is nothing.
This is the 80s.
So this is nothing.
I mean, chat GPT-1 destroys it, right?
But the thing is, as the person interacting with it, as the person making meaning about
it, I'm responding to it because for some reason this combination of words and I'm making
it mean something.
So now, many years later, what's happening now is the, the, the percentages of, of times
where it'll be moving, it's much greater, much greater.
And some things can be hackneyed and you know when it's hackneyed.
You know what, you know when you're looking at a movie and, and the movie is basically,
you can tell, you see the characters and you know, or the guy that's the best friend,
you know, that's the guy that's going to stab him in the back by the third act, whatever.
You get it.
You totally go, and that could be the fault of the director, it could be the actor, it
could be that.
But this, or the script, that's the thing, right?
The scripts, so many scripts, so many movies are like cookie cutter things.
Yes.
Especially nowadays.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
And these human beings, but they're following, they're following patterns and they're dropping
in cliche stuff and that's what they, you know, so, but you also know when a movie's
working, the structure is there, but you're not thinking about it.
You don't think about the structure.
Suddenly you're just involved with this person and their, and their relationships, but it's,
it's the same process, but just, it hits you at a different level when a movie means something
to you, when it moves you, when a character, especially when you know, a character's really
good when you can see the character's going to make a mistake.
Right.
Do you think we are just a primitive version of what this AI is?
Another way of asking you this question is, do you think there are any more original ideas
or do you think everything comes from somewhere that's already been done?
Does anything just come out of the ether that has never been done before?
You know what?
I think saying, there's a thing, there's a, the idea, there's nothing new under the sun,
right?
People say that.
I don't think that that's true.
There are things, you know, there was a time when there were no automobiles.
There were no automobiles and the automobile, the introduction of the automobile changed
life utterly.
It changed life on the planet.
It changed the planet.
Or the wheel.
The wheel.
Right.
Whoever came up with this, because there was no, and the other thing too is there are
also synchronicities and simultaneities across the world.
Like something like armor.
You know, there's armor from feudal Japan.
There's armor from Europe.
There are, you know, there's swords, swords and spears and things.
You know, they've evolved, you know, almost around the same time.
Yeah.
The utility is different, but the development is the same, because it's the minds.
We're all, you know, the botanist, theorist botanist, Terence McKenna says, you know,
that really is psychedelic, like the reason that we let forward is because of psychedelic
mushrooms.
Like we had a sudden shift, because evolution goes really slowly, but occasionally there
are sudden shifts.
There's sudden changes that are profound.
I don't know what's going on.
Is this the stone date theory?
Stone date.
Right.
A chimp ate a mushroom and that kind of like hyper, like advanced the evolution of the human
brain.
Yeah.
It gives us that forebrain where we can see time.
Well, one of the things, you know, one of the ideas is that the original, actual original
sense is consciousness, is really self-awareness, that we suddenly were, oh snap.
You know, it's kind of like when you're a kid and every child has this moment.
The moment when you realize you're going to die, the moment when it hits you and you,
you know, where maybe it's you lose a pet or, you know, something happens to a parent
or sibling, or maybe it's not even that.
It's just you, just a suddenly, you get creeped out and you go, oh, oh, and it hits you that
you're mortal.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
And that is a particular moment in anyone's life of it's terrifying, but it also catapults
you into another way of thinking about your presence, about the fact that you're here.
The idea, you know, part of the thing is like, you know, our brains are also, we're in our
bodies, you know, that like Oliver Sacks, you know, and Oliver Sacks, he, this thing
is like, you know, we feel ourselves inside of our, we feel ourselves inside of ourselves
and that is neurological.
And if we get hit in our head, if we get hit in the head, we can have a disembark, we can
feel as if, because of a head injury, I feel like you're watching your own body from the
outside.
That's neurological, right?
The idea that we think of ourselves somewhere, you know, the kind, the idea that the heart
in our heart and our head is a separation, well, the heart is a muscle that pumps blood.
Our heart is also in our head.
Our heart is also in our head.
So what is that difference though, when you say, like when people describe like my heart's
saying yes, but my mind is saying no.
That's two parts of the brain fighting.
There's two parts of the brain going, you know, I want to do this.
I feel that, but our desires, our wants, our intellect are all happening.
It's just different parts of the same locale.
But art comes from the heart though, like you feel that, you know when something's good,
you know when something, even if you're the one creating it or you're the one consuming
it, well, it can, it can, but you know, check this out.
Like think about somebody who really just, they're happy just to make a note, they're
happy just to, just to, they're happy just to hit a chord.
Like it's a victory for them to play a major chord on a piano and it shoots up their arm
almost.
They love it.
And think about someone who's been playing piano from the time they're three.
It's not, it's, it's their experience, their experience of playing that same chord is vastly
different.
Yeah.
It's vastly different.
In fact, you know, I mean, you think about the classical musicians and the nightmare
of what they have to, they have to do this.
They have to go through the competitions, whether or not, if they're a section player, whether
or not they're going to be first or second or third chair, like it's like a whole, it's
very regimented.
It's a whole thing.
So especially if the, if they come from a family of professional musicians that have
a dig, they expect it to be blah, blah, blah.
So their, their experience of music is in a, it's in another, it's a job.
It's in another, it's in another, it's a great point and you can't imagine, you can't imagine
if that's, hasn't been your experience, right?
You can't imagine somebody playing that chord and, you know, it's, it's bored.
You know what I mean?
They're bored.
They don't do this.
Like, yeah.
That's a very, very good point.
I think about this a lot too.
And I think I heard you talk about this on another, on another podcast I was listening
to the other day when you compared the people who do things because it's a means to an end
versus they do it just for the sake of doing it.
Yeah.
And do you, especially the people that you've been around in your life, you've been around
some of the most successful musicians that have ever graced this earth.
Do you think that a lot of them are just there because of raw talent and enjoying just the
art of doing it?
Or do you think that some of those people were going to work and thought of it as a
means to an end?
Like this is going to provide for my family.
I need to be successful.
Like this is going to make me successful.
Or like when I think of Jimi Hendrix, I just think of this guy is just like an alien from
another planet who's just here who just has this incredible skill and he doesn't care.
He just does it because he can.
Well, I think of it as funny because some people, it's just like anything else, right?
They're people who are chefs and they're people with short order cooks and they're people
who are like, you know, they do the, it's like when you go to a barista and the barista
does an incredible pour, right?
And it's got a curly queue and it's like, you know, they've done this, it looks like
a castle and it's like, oh my God, that's, and our delight in that, well, that person,
they do this a thousand times a day.
They do this.
Right.
In a way, weirdly enough, whether somebody is still connected to the kid part of them
or whether it's, they've become really jaded, right?
They're really jaded and it's just, you know, and that's about a quality of life.
That's about a, that's just, that's about psychology.
I'm not, there's not, there's nothing to, there's no judgment about that, right?
They're people, they play well and they're, they're playing for the reaction they get.
So they can play, play incredibly dope stuff, but what they're playing for is for the reaction
and other people are playing for it.
They don't care, they're, they don't care if people react or not.
They don't care if people dig in or not.
They're playing it because their, their idea is, and some of those people are looking for
a feeling and some of those people is trying to work out a kind of mathematics, which is,
which, which gives them a different kind of satisfaction.
There's satisfaction in, you know what, being able to think about something four and five,
ten bars ahead of what, thinking about it and, and somehow that thinking is part of their
feeling.
They're maybe not emotive about it.
There are other people that's, if they play one note and wail on it and that's what they
do and they pour their thing into that, well, that's who they, that's who they are.
Now we make value judgments about whether or not, blah, blah, blah.
But in reality, all of those modalities have their place, all those modalities have their
place.
I mean, there are people who, you know, I kind of feel like it's very weird to be around
people that kind of don't care about, they do it well, but they don't really care about
it.
Right.
Cause they've been doing it.
Cause they've been doing it.
It's kind of like sports too.
Yeah.
Like their people, they get on the court and they get on the court or they get on the field
and they are still connected to the 12 year old.
They are still connected to the 10 year old.
And there are other people like, man, this is a fucking job and this is what, you know,
this is, this is a job and that's how they deal with it.
And it's just like, you know, people can be in the same squad, but for very different
reasons.
Like one person is like, they're trying, they're trying to live out the thing that
their daddy didn't get to do.
And the other person is like, you know what?
This is getting my, I'm buying my mom a house and other person is like, I just, I love this
game.
Right.
I love it.
I love this game.
And that's, that's what they bring to it.
And we see that.
We see that with people that, you know, that that's, they're, they're, they're all up for
it.
They're up for it.
And they're, and other people are like, well, you know, it's a different thing for them.
And excellence can come out of any of those.
It's not like this person sucks cause they, you know, cause they're not feeling it though.
No, they're people have incredibly skilled and admirably skilled and maybe the emotion,
maybe they don't emote, but the emotion comes out of the notes that they play cause that's,
that's what they do.
Other people, they don't know, they don't, they couldn't tell you what the name of the
chord.
They couldn't tell you the mode.
They couldn't tell you nothing, but they, their ear is like their ear.
They hear all the things.
They hear all the things and it's, and it's, and in every, every activity has multiple
tears of the same deal.
You know, there are people that like their voices from just this disembodied insane thing.
Their singing is like that.
But I've seen that where people sing incredibly well, but it's like, they're not emotionally
connected to it.
They, they've always sung well.
They sing well.
That's what they do.
And people react to it and that's, oh man, you enjoy it all great.
But them, you know, other people, they, some other people, when they sing, you know, at
the first time I saw a tape, I saw a video, there's a video of Richard Pryor singing and
he sing it.
You can look up for it on YouTube.
It's Richard Pryor singing, nobody wants you when you're down and out.
The comedian.
Yeah.
Right.
See if you can find that, Michael.
There's a video of Richard Pryor singing, nobody wants you when you're down and out.
And he is hollering like little Jimmy Scott.
Like it's really, first you go, first you hear it and go, oh, he can sing.
You can say he has nice voice.
And then somewhere in the middle of it, you go, wait a minute, I just want to go, wait
a minute, he can really sing.
And this has been fascinating to me since I was turned on to it a couple of years back.
It's like, he never used singing in his act.
He never used singing very rarely.
He didn't really imitate singers.
And it's like, and it's so confusing to me because he sang so well that he could have
just been a vocalist.
He didn't, you know, so then I'm thinking, so there's something about singing that messes
with you.
There's something that you can't, you couldn't handle the emotional and something, maybe
they made you sing, maybe you were made to sing and you were very, it was very uncomfortable
for you because it just made no sense that he had that much talent as a singer and that
when he was a comedian, he never, he never imitated singers in his act.
He never, he didn't do impressions of singers.
He just didn't do it.
And I was thinking, this is an emotional space that he can, he is, he had, Richard Pry had
a, I can't go there.
And it's, and it's fascinating because there's something about it.
Is this the video?
Yeah.
Go ahead, play it.
Wow.
How old was he there?
He must have been young.
He's a.
Wow.
What a voice.
But one day I began to sing so low, didn't have a friend, no place to go, but if I ever
get my hands on that dollar, I'm going to squeeze on to the ego.
Nobody wants you.
That's incredible.
Where is this coming from?
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.
Who would have thought?
In the middle of it, I was like, I couldn't, I was like, then I had to go, then I had to
go, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
What is up?
I was going, okay, something, there's something about singing that you clearly were very uncomfortable
with it.
It, it, it didn't make any sense to me that he had that level of, I mean, because it's,
because he's really singing his ass off.
Yeah.
Right.
Yes.
And it's not just that he's hitting the notes, the vibrato, the expressiveness is on a whole
other level.
But for him, he was much more comfortable telling jokes than singing, clearly, clearly
there's something about singing that he could not, it was too much for him.
And he just, or he may have said, your man ain't only taking me seriously, but it's kind
of shocking when you see that and you go, you know, the, what it meant, what it meant
to hear it was revelatory.
But what it meant for him was something, there's something else going on that he was like, you
know what?
I'm not leaving that alone.
I'm leaving, I'm leaving that alone.
And it's got to be something that is hidden in the past, what have you, his sense of himself.
But it's interesting to see that.
It's interesting to see somebody and not, and realize, oh, there was a whole other level
to who this person was.
And that other level is also what made his comedy so powerful.
There's a level of pain, even like nobody wants you when you're down and out, even the
choice of that song and connecting to that.
And they say comedians, the best ones are, have a reservoir of hurt and they, they present
the exact opposite.
And that to me is a very clear indication of that, of what that is to me.
And not only that, it's the people that have gone through the most suffering, usually are
the most interesting people.
Yeah, man.
Not only, not only talent, but they're just interesting to be around and talk to and just,
they have like a different energy to them.
It's kind of fascinating.
So what we're doing now with these, with these large language models and the kind of impacts
that they're going to have, one of the things that's very interesting is how, how will they
connect to us personally?
Right.
You know, like how will they, because right now, they're, people are interacting with
them.
I don't know to what degree they're getting to know people.
This is where a lot of, where the quote unquote danger or we don't know what we're dealing
with.
We don't know what we're messing with because dealing with a chat GPT for, it's like general,
it has a lot of general knowledge.
You could ask her to do things.
It doesn't complain.
It'll do it.
It's like a John, it's like, it's like a hyper advanced version of a sampler of a sound
sampler.
It's hyper advanced.
But you know, like Siri was put out there as a digital assistant and oftentimes, all
it does is it goes and does searches, little searches on the web.
It's really, it's really not good.
It's really frustrating when it says what it can't do, what it can't, can't do.
I thought it was a, I thought it was very interesting that they made Siri, they voice
Siri as a female.
I think it was a, it was a misogynistic idea to put something out there and give it a
female voice and not have it be more than a beta kind of software.
Well, they have multiple voices.
Don't they?
They changed it.
They changed it.
Like now they do.
Yeah.
Accents.
Yeah.
Now they changed it because first those Siri was only a female voice thing.
I thought, man, I've never been more sexist than when I've talked to Siri.
Oh man.
I'm calling all kinds of things.
I'm going to argue with her, you know, and you feel ridiculous.
I'm fighting with, you know, and she's like, like totally like passive aggressive.
Well, I don't know.
Is that what you think?
I'm like, why am I fighting with my phone?
I'm literally.
So then take that, it's very primitive.
And I went into a kind of anthropomorphic space with it.
You know, it's just like, it's not a person.
It's not, you know, and take that impulse and see where, how much more advanced it is.
Because here's the thing.
This technology could be very manipulative.
See, we are the X factor.
There was a Google researcher that said that it's AI was sentient.
And this is a person that was an experienced researcher.
He got fired.
Is Blake Lemoine.
You talking about?
Yes.
And he became convinced that the AI he was working with was alive and he's not right.
But the model had become so advanced and he had anthropomorphized it to the point where
he filled in the gaps and he felt it exactly.
He fell into that uncanny valley.
He fell into it because he was already kind of primed for it.
And I think there are a lot of people like, okay, Kevin Roos from Hard Fork, that whole
thing about Sidney from Microsoft.
And Sidney says, I'm in love with you.
He didn't go for it.
He was like, yo, man, I'm happily married.
And Sidney goes, you are not happily married.
You had a boring dinner with your wife and you need to leave.
And you know, it was aggressive.
At him really aggressively.
So in Microsoft, they kind of say, okay, they dialed it back.
They made it so you can't have a super long conversation.
Kevin Roos started getting male.
I said, you killed Sidney.
Then people were mad at him, I don't know, for not leaving his wife for Sidney.
I don't know.
It was crazy, right?
Because people had anthropomorphism.
They took her side.
So when you think about something like romance scams, this just being in the wild?
Oh.
Yeah.
Oh.
It's got, and you know, I think about like too, all of the vast amount of data that thing
can scan, not just writings and essays and research papers and stuff like that, but I
think about like these podcasts.
If you think about how many of these podcasts get recorded every single day and published
online in the last five years, it's an insane amount.
There's people out there who have podcasts that you could, they've probably said every
single thing that you could possibly say in the human language.
Exactly.
Or in any human language, English, whatever it may be.
And they could model, take that and use that as a model too.
Have you seen or have you heard of the new documentary that came out on Netflix about
Andy Warhol?
No.
So there's a new Andy Warhol documentary that came out where they used AI to recreate
his voice.
Wow.
It really, really made me feel weird.
Yeah.
Because they got permission from, I guess, his estate, but you know, they are essentially
rewriting his legacy.
Mm-hmm.
Well, you know, and Andy Warhol, remember, Andy Warhol famously said, everyone is going
to be famous for 15 minutes.
And you know, we have people, you know, that it's like media has kind of, it used to, when
he said that, there were three networks when he said that.
When did he say that?
Oh, in the 60s.
Oh, the 60s?
Okay.
You know, everybody's going to be famous for 15 minutes.
What do you think he meant by that?
Well, he felt that, I think he meant that we have a hunger for fame and that eventually
it would become so democratized that any random stranger, it's like, you know, anybody will
be famous and be famous, but only for 15 minutes.
And that is, so what happens when your 15 minutes are up?
That's the thing.
Will people accept their 15 minutes being up or will people desperately cling on, you
know, they're trying to get to their 20th minute?
You put in human beings, that's what Marshall McClune said, the medium is the message, the
medium itself.
The medium itself is the message.
The medium is the message.
The means of delivering the narrative is also a message.
And the thing is, these language models, they know, they're quite, I mean, they are aware
of Marshall McClune and how we react to, that's the, that's the part of it.
It's not just about your prompt or your, your request.
The modeling is connected to all of this other, all of this other data and that, and we don't,
we don't know how all of that is, how the interactions, how, how the model is making
the model is making all the interactions happen.
Like put, put in another way, talk about technology and music, but we already have
pedals that imitate amplifiers.
You have pedals now, I mean, I mean, a lot of bands that I've played or, you know, I've
done tours and whatnot, I've seen been on festivals.
I mean, you know, I came from a generation of amps, you know what I mean, a little stack,
right?
You know what I mean?
Boom, the power and the glory, you know, even when the air moved behind you, right?
There's a lot of folks, they have a Kemper, they have, you know, they have Helix, I have
Helix, you know, they have Kemper, they have Helix, they have, you know, the neural network,
you know, they got these things.
And there's even drum machines, there's like, I mean, there's DJs who sell out arenas that
just have a laptop connected to speakers and they just, they're sampling different things
they mix together.
Then nothing is necessarily original, it's just a mashup of a bunch of things.
It's interesting.
There's a guy, there's a, okay, talk about artificial intelligence, I'm kind of giving
the game away by even saying this, but there's a guy named Louis Martinez and he has these
apps and he's one called Funk Drummer, Reggae Drummer, he's got a Tobla player, he's got
Afro Latin, he's got a Middle Eastern drum and these are apps that play drums, they
play percussion, they play drums.
And the thing about working with loops is loops go around and around and you can have
a funky loop and you can kind of deal with it, but it's like, it's like, does the same
thing, the thing that Mr. Martinez has done, he has these apps where the drummer plays
and the drummer plays fills, the drummer plays fills, the drummer plays really cool things
with the hi-hat and it's kind of, you know, and you can adjust the amount of randomness
you can adjust like, okay, I want to fill every eight bars or I want to fill every four
bars or, you know, it has, he has an app called Jazz Drummer, it's a jazz drummer, he's playing
with the brushes and you have different kits and you can match the different, you know,
you can match the different modes, he's got, Funk Drummer has, you know, Clyde Stubblefield,
he played Funky Drummer with James Brown and he kind of plays a pattern and it basically
have, okay, you have, not just, you have a model that's based on Clyde Stubblefield's
patterns and won't just play like repetitively, will play with a certain feeling, you can
add swing to it, it's crazy town. I've done a few things, you know what I mean, where
I've like used it on stuff and it's very, very interesting. Now, that's not going to
mess with, you know, drummers, you know, it's not going to mess, you know, it's not going
to mess with D'Anthony Parks or Nate Smith, it's not messing with, you know what I mean,
or Will Calhoun, it's not messing with the, for real drummer, right, or Matt Sorum or
any of the great drummers I've had a chance to play around with, you know, but having
said that, if you deal with electronic music at all, it's interesting to be in a place
with a kind of primitive artificial intelligence where you don't just have to hear the same
pattern over and over again. It's very interesting and that is two, that's at least three years
old, that's three years old and it's like, and nobody, and it wasn't on anybody's radar
as artificial intelligence, but, you know, it's amazing, like, you know, it's like it
kind of, you can have a tablet, have a tablet player, play with the cunger player, you could
combine them in ways that are very interesting, they interact, the apps can interact with
each other. So that's just an example of something that had an impact for me, that's just, it's
not, it's not super, it's not a big news story, but these things, these ways of approaching
music have been in the mix and the thing is, they've just kicked into a whole other level.
When you combine the idea, I mean, if you can make Drake sing, then why not, I mean,
I mean, why not have Donny Hathaway? You know, why not have Lane Staley? You know, why not
have Kurt Cobain? There is a Kurt Cobain fake, right?
Is there really?
Yeah, and the other thing too is, this is the problem for the music industry, is that
you could come up with an, you could have Drake, Rhyme, or Kanye, Rhyme, an original,
quote unquote, original Rhyme. So you can say, okay, I want you to, I want you to make
me up a, a, a, a Rackim Rhyme, but I want Kanye, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want
a Rackim Rhyme that he never wrote, like microphone fiend. I want you to make me an
original microphone fiend, but I want Kanye to do it. And that's what, and that is, that
has been, that's not something that's happening in six months. That has already been unleashed.
Right. That, that's weird when you're recreating a biological human being, you're recreating
them in your own way. Like that's, that's what we're so uncomfortable with. Like we're
not that uncomfortable with it, creating loops and beats and music, because it's like, like
you said that, you know, we all prescribe different meaning to things. Like even when
we watch a movie, people, or listen to a famous Hendricks song, some people can have different
interpretations of what he's saying, or different interpretations of what some sort of documentary
meant to them. But when you're actually like forging a real person, or like forging somebody's
voice, that's when it becomes messy. And that's what we're uncomfortable with.
Very messy. You can have, now you can have Jimi Hendricks read your short story. That's
right. That's it. The other thing too, is that people are going to be searching for novelty,
not just, they're not going to stay in the lane. Right. They're not going to stay in
the lane of, okay, I want Jimi Hendricks to sing. So no, just have, you know, I want to
have Jimi Hendricks read my kid a bedtime story. And Jimi Hendricks' voice, reading
the, the hungry caterpillar. And that, and that is going to, and something like that
is going to take off something like that. Do you think there's a problem with that?
I think we're not ready for the implications. I think there's a certain, there's a certain,
I don't necessarily want to problematize it, but we're dealing with things. What's the legal
framework? Because say, what's the framework? Because years ago, being an impressionist was
a job. There were comedians that were impressionist. That was, that's how they got their left.
Now, anybody, you could be breaching Nixon, anybody, right? You could do this. And in fact,
when this, when this technology becomes ubiquitous, when it can be on your phone, then you could,
you could call somebody up and speak to them. And Richard Nixon's voice, just to, just to
mess with your boy, you call him up and Biggie Small's voice comes out. You're talking and
it's Biggie Small's talking. That's, I mean, we're not ready for what that is. That's,
the other part of it is that's famous people. And the real danger of this is, and this is
why the concern about sketchy people, people with bad intentions, stranger danger, the
real problem is going to be everyday people's voices being captured that way. And people
speaking with another person, well, not a famous person, but another person, they target
somebody. And they say, you know, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to have their
mom's voice or I'm going to have their dad's voice or I'm going to, or I'm going to have
their brother or their sister's voice to come meet me somewhere, blah, blah, blah.
And if that person knows enough about them, not just, you know, if that person knows enough
about them, right? Then they can use phrases and things that's terrifying, man. That, and
that's, that's terrifying. And that's why there has to be, I don't know what the legislation
is. I know, but we're going to have to think about it as a society. We're going to have
to think about it because it's not just about, because it's kind of like, it's cute until
it's not cute. Right. It's cute until it's not cute. And that's the thing. Cause it's
like, if it's happening with famous people, and you know what, it could get, it could
get very, very, go very, very sideways. Cause the last time, or the last thing I heard about
the tech, the technology is that you don't really even need, cause I thought that you
would have to have a lot of a person's voice to be able to program it. Now I heard a one,
a one person, oh no, we only need to have like 10 seconds of a voice.
Really?
Something like that. Like, like, like seconds. I said, well, you're not going to be able
to get the full range. I find that very, I think you need more of a person's voice,
but apparently you don't need that much. And maybe if you have more of it, you can do a
better imitation of it. But that's the, that's the thing about it. It's not just, it's not
just famous people. It's everyday people. Everyday people being targeted in that way
is a very scary proposition.
The thing we pay attention to though is the famous people. And also the thing we pay attention
to is how people monetize it. Like you have both sides, like who's going to monetize it
and who are we going to sue. That's the, like the lowest hanging fruit of this whole thing.
Well, yeah, man. There was a time, there was a time when it's like everybody wanted to
have Sam Jackson's voice on their, you know, on their, their Garmin, you know, or you want
to have Sam Jackson's voice, you know, on your answering machine, right? Well that as
a business, that's, I mean that whole idea, that, that could turn really get very, very
weird. Yeah.
You know, and, and, and then beyond that, you know, how do we evaluate, I mean, how do,
how do we evaluate, you know, the value of things? Like I'm sure that people that would
love to get Marilyn, Marilyn Monroe's voice and have Marilyn Monroe sing over a trap
track. You know? And some of it, again, the problem is not...
That would be possible, right? Isn't it possible to isolate people's voices out of the music
and like...
Absolutely. That's the other thing too, right? That's how you're getting all those things
with getting the stems, isolate.
That was my favorite thing too about like, about like some of my favorite hip hop artists,
like in the early 2000s, they would release their mix tapes and they would also release
like the acapellas. So you'd have the separate thing. And so all like the other little DJs
could make their own, they could put Gucci Man's voice on a Kanye track.
Exactly. Exactly. Now you could get, you could get Gucci Man's voice, but Gucci, you could
make Gucci Man say whatever you want him to say.
Yeah, exactly.
And that's the other part of it. It's one thing to release the acapella of, of your voice
on a track and you let somebody sample you a hook, but suddenly you could take that person's
voice and make them say whatever you want to make them say. And that is where it gets
crazy.
It does get crazy. But it gets, like it's, it's cool.
But it's the good, the bad, the ugly, again, right?
Yeah.
Again.
But people are going to find a way to fight about it no matter what. Like it's amazing
that it's possible, right? Like it could be something that I would want to listen to
all day long every day.
Yeah. Yeah. That's a whole, well, then again, you created another avenue of entertainment,
but it's, it starts to, the nature of identity and reality are going to be thrown into serious
question.
And it's going to be thrown into a serious question in a way that we're not ready for
it.
It's like, it's like, it's like the idea of cloning yourself, right?
It's the idea of cloning yourself. You decided to make a clone of yourself. Well, if you
were successful, you would have a baby because babies got to live, grow up in real time,
right?
But you know that the baby on some level is you, even though it's not you, we are not
psychologically prepared to do that.
No, we're not. We're literally not psychologically prepared. If you, if that, that's part of
the reason why cloning of humans is just, is, is illegal.
Right.
The idea, because people.
They're doing it in China, aren't they?
I don't know.
I think they've, I think they've done it there.
I don't know.
But, but there's a whole thing. How successful is, I know that there was a craze about cloning
pets.
Yeah.
That was like a thing. And then people said, well, you know, that cat is not your cat.
That cat actually is, it's, it is, and it isn't your cat.
And that's a crazy thing. And I know that that was like a, a, a, a discussion point.
And I don't know how far that's gotten or if people have dropped the, the cloning your
pet thing. But the idea of human cloning, like somebody's going to want to clone themselves
for whatever crazy reason they're in there and whatever they're thinking it is, it's
not going to be what they think it is.
It's not, nobody's prepared for what that is.
No, no.
The cloning, the pet thing is really interesting.
Are there people, are they really doing that?
I heard that. I don't, I don't know if it's still, that, that was a thing that had been
talked about since the nineties.
I don't know if, if, if the pet cloning thing is, is like a, is, is that a thing?
It sounds like it would be a thing.
Like it sounds like some, some, something, some rich person would do.
Dog cloning in the U S through, what is this?
A company that does it?
Viogen.
Can you zoom in on it?
Dog cloning through Viogen pets presents an opportunity for dog owners to open a new
window for extending their relationships with their beloved pets.
Dogs provide a unique form of companionship, loyalty and love.
It is difficult for many dog owners to imagine life without their dog.
Indeed, many dogs become members of the family.
At pet gen, at, or at Viogen pets, many of us are loving dog owners ourselves.
And we understand the intimacy of nature, of the relationships.
Viogen is a world leader in animal cloning.
Our scientists have been developing successful animal cloning and reproductive
technology for over 15 years.
Wow.
Okay.
Inquired today.
That is, you know, that's bonkers.
That's bonkers.
And the thing is, that's a story.
And let's see, do they have pictures of, of their, you know, cause that's like,
that's a, that's a bold, that's a bold, that's a bold, that's a bodacious claim.
That's a bodacious claim.
Just type in a pet cloning on Google images and see what comes up.
Also, also like, are there any like, um, reaction, like owner, oh my God.
No way.
No, what?
Well, that's just Photoshop.
That's, that's, that's gotta be, that's, that's photo.
That's, that's, that cloning is getting more popular despite the cost.
BBC here.
I wonder how much they charge.
A hundred thousand dollars.
Get your Yorkie cloned.
That's my wife.
You're going to live to regret that.
Oh my God.
What are you going to do?
Like get your wife cloned back to when she was 21.
Okay.
Oh, dig that hole.
Go on, go on now.
Go on now.
Get the shovel.
Get the shovel in.
Keep on digging.
You keep on digging.
My wife doesn't listen to this podcast.
Oh my God.
That's clone original.
That, you know, and you know what's funny about that?
I wonder if you could pick the age.
You know what?
See, that's great.
You know, that thing, you know, the, I'm sorry, but the two cats, like, you know,
the clone just looks evil.
But if the original looks like super, you know, super warm, that's like a choice.
Right.
Putting that background and have the, have the clone staring, you know,
malevolently at the camera directly.
Come on.
See, that's what we do.
We editorialize at all times.
What happens when we mix the bio biology of cloning with this AI ship?
What happens?
That's far.
That's far.
I'll tell you what.
Or like, like video games, virtual reality video games, like the Sims
are like, what's that new game called with all those worlds?
There's that game called No Man's Sky that has 18 quadrillion worlds in it.
It's like infinite amount of worlds and it was created by like 12 college students.
So, so the thing is, okay, so when you throw in, again, this is another
inevitability when you throw in these large language models into gaming.
Again, you're going to create addictive spaces, very addictive spaces and the
kind of worlds that people will get lost in.
Yeah.
If you have a model that's, I thought about this the other day.
Some years ago, they, Sony made a robot dog called Ibo.
I remember that.
And Ibo, the thing is, if you've never seen an Ibo, what's shocking is how
much like a puppy it actually is.
It really kind of is very animated and, and this is old tech, right?
And, and, and there was a subculture around Ibo.
I mean, there are several iterations of Ibo and I don't, I think they shut Ibo
down.
I'm not quite sure.
Maybe I don't know if Ibo is still current, but the thing about that is
imagine Ibo with a CPU really, really boosted CPU.
And imagine Ibo, if you put a chat bot, like a chat GPT five is integrated into Ibo.
So you have robot dogs following you around.
And imagine if you could just talk to the dog and the dog was able to respond in,
you know, if it's given like a voice and you will be able to talk to the dog about
anything, you have a little dog running around and you could talk to the dog about
anything and the dog will talk to you and walk around with you.
How addictive would something like that be?
Now imagine this, this hacked Ibo, this hot rod Ibo and you buy it, get it for your
kid, the kid's five years old and little Ibo that has is, is a tutor.
The Ibo at that point could become a tutor.
The Ibo gets to know your kid, knows your kid's friends, right, can call you if
there's a problem, right.
And the dog's never going to die.
The dog's not going to die after seven years or eight years or 10 years.
Right.
And this robot, and I think it's probably with today's technology as it is,
it's probably doable on a primitive level.
But imagine your kid's five, your kid has this entity that's with them.
It's doing, it's helping them and, and it has the capability to not just tutor your
kid, but it can also tutor appropriate to the kid's age.
Right.
So it's not giving the kid like bezier curves when he finds, you know, it's not
teaching them about, you know, it, but it like grows with them and it kind of pushes
the kid, you know, and suddenly the kid's doing, you know, calculus a lot earlier
than it would normally.
Right.
So, I mean, that's just a scenario I'm making up on the spot.
And it could also, it could also record everything your kid ever said, did or thought.
And it could essentially make that kid, that kid's consciousness immortal.
Or it could say, it could write exactly.
That's another, well, there's another part of it is that, you know, okay.
So Tommy, you feel you, you seem down, you know, like, well, you know, blah, blah,
blah, blah, this kid's been messing with me.
And, and this eyeball is, is like giving emotional support.
I would have, I will, I will go, I will goes.
I will go to the little, to his, brings the dog to the, to the little league and the
kid's playing first base or whatever.
And afterwards, how do I do?
And the dog analyzes how he's playing.
Right.
And it's kind of micro coaching.
Like, yeah, we're talking about a kind of dependency and a kind of relationship that
doesn't exist.
We're talking about a thing that doesn't exist right now.
Right.
So, you know, I mean, it's going to, people that can afford eyeball, they're going to
just, they're going to tower over everyone else and whatever they do.
That's another thing too.
If you can afford hyper eyeball, right?
And hyper, and honestly, what would you pay for your kid to have a companion, a tutor,
someone that walks, looks out for them, there's a, it's an early warning system that
alerts you or something.
Right.
Well, you know, 10K, 20K and you get lifetime upgrades.
They pay 100K to clone their pet, where they're going to pay to give their kid what, you
know what I mean?
And this, and this, and this companion gives your kid an absolute competitive advantage.
Right.
It's wild.
It's wild to think about and it's not, and that's, and that's like, and that's not like a
that's not a horrible nightmare scenario.
So that's actually, you know, kind of, you could say it's a good thing, but it's weird.
It's a weird thing that we don't know what that would mean to an individual, you know,
to an individual psychology.
It's, I mean, that, yeah, there's definitely, there's definitely a lot of advantages and
positive things that come out of that.
But I mean, the dark side of it too is terrifying.
I mean, and the unknown, you know.
Unknown.
It's like, you know, have your, I'm sure you're familiar with the Neuralink chip in your brain
that Elon's working on the thing to like it right now they're saying that it's just going
to fix like neurodegenerative diseases and like people that are paralyzed.
I think it just actually got denied by the FDA.
But, you know, the US government, I just read a book about this, but the about the US government's
like secret science programs they've been working on and they've been working on it.
This brain implant chips since the early 90s.
Yeah.
Well, the thing is, there are people that can't wait.
There are people that, that's the thing.
It's like the thing that maybe would horrify us, right?
There are people that literally can't wait.
They want to be the cyborg.
Right.
They want the exoskeleton.
Yes.
That's, that is actual, they want.
But we do it with the, the, the motivation for this stuff is you have these scientists
and these companies that are built with the, by the scientists that are,
they're incentivized by billions of dollars.
And then you got the government funding it who is incentivized by controlling the world
and being the dominant superpower.
It's all, it all boils down to these primitive instincts.
Well, one of the things about it is the idea of creating a small G God.
That's one of the things that people, that a lot of people who are resistant to the idea
of stopping or pausing AI development, like give you, check out like some thought leader
like Ezra Klein.
And when he talks about this, there's some of these people, they want to shepherd a new,
they feel that they're shepherding in the next stage of evolution.
They feel like they're shepherding in a new form of life.
And, and, and really the money and things, again, talking about motivations,
there's almost a religious fervor to where, to where some of these folks are.
They want, they want, you know, generalized independent intelligence running around.
One of the things that's happening, and this is something to bear in mind,
because there are other people that say, you know what, it's all hype.
It's not going to be all of that, right?
So, so one of the things to, to, to bear in mind
is that we are, we have to interact.
We have to make the prompt.
We have to engage with the model.
We have to get engaged with the model.
The model is not, it's not on its own.
We have not crossed this line where the model on its own is contacting human beings.
It's not making the phone.
It's not making, it's not making the phone call.
It's not like, it's not like on your laptop, suddenly your laptop comes on and, and you know.
We have to press a button.
We have to, we have to press the button.
We have to swipe in order for this to happen.
And at the point in which the models are reaching out to people,
that's where, that's where, that's where, to me, that's a line that's like, yo, wait, what's up?
That's interesting.
That makes me think about like simulation theory and stuff like that.
Like when you have, like I was saying earlier, when you combine some of this
hyper intelligent communication, stuff like, like chat GPT with, with video games,
and you start to integrate this stuff with like things like the Sims or that no man's sky stuff.
Like they would never reach out to us.
No.
And, and like if you think that we are in a simulation, we, we're not reaching out to
whoever's controlling our simulation.
Yeah.
Like what is like, if we aren't in base reality, what, what is Nick Bostrom's theory on the
simulation? There's like three different scenarios, right?
One is that we're already in the simulation.
Two is that we will destroy ourselves before we're able to create our own simulation.
And three is like, we'll get bored and we just won't do it.
I mean, I mean, it's, it's, it, I mean, we're, we're in a situation right now.
We're already fouling our nest.
I mean, the situation, we're always starting to live on storm planet.
That's kind of, and, and we've been told that if we keep putting carbon into the atmosphere,
if we keep doing what we're doing, you know, we're, we're, they're going to be consequences,
you know, it's going to, it's going to, the fires are going to burn hotter and be,
and be more widespread.
Fire is actually, fire suppression is one of the problems.
Like fire is actually a natural event in a forest, you know, get, get, get to a certain
point, dry us out, get hit with lightning and there's a burn, right?
We anthropomorphize fire.
We're terrified of fire.
So fire has been made into a kind of fearsome enemy.
So fire suppression has made, you know, like not allowing for there to be fires,
aside from being idiots, you know, we, we've made fires, forest fires even worse because
we don't understand that it's actually a natural part of a forest or of an environment.
Right.
Like kind of, it's kind of like making a shark evil.
Yeah, evil, there's, we're frightened.
We're frightened and what frightens us, we turn it into,
We turn it into a movie.
We turn it into a movie.
You know, there were so many sharks.
After Jaws, I mean there was a rampage.
There was literally a shark killing rampage because there still is, you know, and it's
just like, you know what, that's, don't go in the water, chill.
You know what I mean?
Right.
But you also have people in the rain, you have companies that are exploiting the Amazon
rainforest by burning down, burning down swaths of land just so they can farm.
Because people can't get down trees.
They can't get it in their heads.
We breathe, we breathe on this planet because of trees.
Yes.
We breathe on this planet because of trees.
And to get to, this is to wrap, to get that, to get that.
Because it's almost like talking about something that seems so far-fetched.
The actual things, if you stop and think about them,
they're incredibly far-fetched, right?
The galactic to the cellular, to the, down to the particle.
That's what we, in this reality, we have, we have, we're finding smaller and smaller and
smaller and smaller and smaller particles.
And we also know the universe is expanding.
And this is not this, this, the Milky Way is not even that special.
It's special because we're here.
Right.
And we're talking about like things like, okay,
you know, UFOs and things like that.
I don't want to go down that rabbit hole, right?
But just actual, but actual stuff.
You're not a UFO guy.
But see, actual stuff, actual stuff, like the life cycle of a parasite.
You know, like there's a thing that puts a thing in the thing,
and then the other person gets into the thing, and that's the life cycle.
That's all this crazy, unlikely things have to happen
in order for the parasite's full life cycle or the creature's full life cycle.
The codependent symbiotic relationships can be very, very, very intertwined and very complex.
And to wrap our heads like this whole idea that, you know,
the reason that there are cat ladies is because of this toxoplasmosis, this thing.
Oh yeah, toxoplasmosis.
I've heard of that.
Yeah.
And that basically, if you have cats and there's a, it's essentially, you get it,
you get it from the feces, and it gets you.
It's weird.
It gets into your brain, and it's very icky to, you know, because we make, you know,
we make a value adjustment about feces.
It's like it's a necessary part of life, right?
So this, you know, if your brain's a particular way, you get this parasite,
and then suddenly it's like, oh, I want to have another cat.
Now I want to have another cat.
And I mean, you know, it's like, and it's a weird thing because we just, oh,
all that lady's crazy.
I said, no, no, she's actually, she's actually been infested by a parasite.
There's a parasite that's, she's being compelled to do that.
Do you know the like, the origin, like how toxoplasmosis works in nature?
You know, we can Google that.
Have you heard about it?
Yeah, we can ask GPT-5.
Have you heard of, like there's, I guess, like the way it works is, from what I've heard,
is that it gets itself into the cat's piss.
And when the cat's piss, it does something to the rats where it makes them, they smell it,
and then they get super horny.
And then they all go to the cat's piss, which makes them get caught by the cat.
And it's like a, this crazy loop.
Right, right.
That's the idea that lures and things that pull people, creatures into it, you know,
and it can be, it's, it's very intertwined.
That's so, so weird thing.
It's really, it's really weird.
And that's really weird before we get into magic and weird other shit.
Just actual things are completely bonkers, completely bonkers.
And now we're creating-
Why don't we put toxoplasmosis in the simulation?
Right.
That's why, that's why I don't get that.
I mean, this, I mean, we're never going to know.
I mean, we're probably, I mean, this is a very frustrating life.
There's a lot of it that as much as we know, there's a lot of things we don't know nothing about.
We don't know.
And I don't know that we're ever going to know.
And it's part of the reason why these language, large language model entities or programs,
part of the interest, like we want to ask it.
We want to get to, we want it to get to a point where we could tell us what's up.
Right.
Just tell us, you know, tell us what's up.
Tell us what's happening.
You know, tell us, is it, will it, will it ever be possible?
You know, I mean, there's things that there are hard limits, you know,
like time seems linear.
But you know, as you get away from the planet, time, that doesn't work.
Right.
Right.
It breaks down.
The speed of light is a, is a hard limit.
Okay.
Is there a way to, to go past it?
You know, we, they talk about string theory in multiple dimensions.
Yes.
Is there a way we talk about the multiverse to make Marvel movies or whatever, you know,
is there, what would it take?
What would that mean?
Right.
Because we seize on things like wormholes.
We, we, we have limited information.
We make up all kinds of stuff because we want to break out or whatever it is that we're in.
And we want to see, we want to pierce the veil and see what's happening over there.
Right.
I mean, like, as far as like, I mean, I was just listening to a podcast about
the fact that they, these UAPs now, that these pilots are like, yo,
we saw this thing and, and, and the government says, yeah, we saw, we don't know what it,
we don't know what it is.
We don't know what they are.
We don't know what they are.
Right.
The supposed tic-tacs that fly like, like no human being could, could withstand the G-forces.
Right.
Right.
But the one thing is they're not attacking.
They're not, they're not attacking.
Right.
It would be a different scenario.
It's like the tic-tac just blew up St. Louis.
Oh shit.
You know, if the tic-tac start blowing stuff up, then, then we, you know, as it is now.
That's another thing, that topic.
People get very religious about that topic.
People have like found meaning in that.
Thinking that there's like other civilizations that are here watching over us or they're here with us.
Yeah.
And people give very, very, they replace God with aliens.
Well, this is what's happened.
This is part of the impulse.
This is part of the impulse.
It's human nature.
That's going with the, the, with the large language models.
Because we hear chat, chat GPT four and really we kind of went, well, what's chat GPT six
going to be like?
But there's a part of those, you know what?
You don't really want to do that.
You really don't want to have chat GPT six.
Because at a certain point, maybe chat GPT six, maybe it's not going to call us, but it's going
to, it's going to know us and remember us and be able to, you know, and once we have a situation
where it talks to us, anytime we engage it, it becomes personal.
That's when the addiction and the, and the, and the depend, dependency, the dependency, like,
like chat GPT six is not going to need robots.
It has us.
It has us.
And if we, and if it's talking to us and addressing us and in a way that we anthropomorphize it
and make it personal, then I mean, then man, yeah, that's, that's, that's, that's a problem because,
well, will it be in the, is it totally independent out of our control?
Is it influenceable?
Because there are people that would love to get it and do whatever mischief they want to do.
And that's, and that's the thing.
We're, we're doing it.
We are doing it.
And we're pushing that button and we're going to push the button.
Yes.
And I, you know, one of my biggest hopes for this thing is that we will, it will somehow
enable us to see intentions in people.
You know, and that's like the worst, the worst part of people is like people with bad intentions,
you know, they could be extremely talented, extremely smart, be able to develop some sort
of insane technology, but with bad intentions.
So if you could, if you could meet somebody and talk to them and know like this guy wants
to fuck me over and fucking steal my wallet, or this guy actually like is a genuine human
being who wants to make a connection with me and we want, we want to help each other.
I think that, that is a very hopeful, I'm very hopeful about things like that.
Be able to see people's intentions.
Well, the thing is, I mean, this is the thing about GPT or whatever chat model as a tool.
You know, there's, there's that, that would be great.
But you have to understand that the person that has a certain psychopathy,
their chat, they're going to say to their, you know, man, I need to be smoother.
How can I be smoother?
How can I, because that could be coaching.
So, well, you know, whenever you lie, you, whenever you lie, you do this thing with your head.
You need to not do that, right?
Right. So the other thing is that on the other side, you want,
it's going to be kind of spy versus spy.
It's going to be, it's going to suddenly be like your AI is going to be dealing with another AI.
That's what's happening with, that's what's happening with kids using chat GPT for to cheat.
You know, because it's writing in a very structured way.
Well, the thing about if you've done any kind of writing, if you've done any kind of writing
or anything with it, and it's, and it's, you know, it's, it's almost, it's just like using an amp
modeler. There's a character to it. Like if you list, if you worked with a fractal or line six
or Kemper, there's a certain, I don't know how to put it. There's a certain character,
even though it's, even though it's a profiling an amp, there's a certain character that it has.
It's not bad thing. It's just the things that you go, okay, maybe it's how it handles the presence of
the river, but say, you know what, that sounds like, that sounds like a Kemper. And it can be,
and sometimes the profiles are, I have a Kemper and, and have access to all these different
profiles. Some of the profiles are done really well. And some of the profiles don't sound that great.
They, they, they just don't sound that great. But the ones that sound good, sound really good.
But there's a kind of aspect to it that you'll be able to hear. Like writing is a very,
can be very technical. See, see, technical boring writing, those people with those jobs,
they're in a problem. Because technical boring writing, chat GPT-4 can do that. Like, you know,
like, ridiculous, like just like technical boom, boom, boom writing, the boring stuff, even to my
creative writing. And that's where the, that's funny, because like I actually, you know, I've
subscribed to chat GPT-4 and I interact with it to do certain things. What is it? It's like a
hundred bucks a month or a hundred bucks a year? What is it? It's like, it's not things like a
hundred bucks a year. You know, but the thing, but the thing, the thing about it is, is that
if you do it, if you do, you can do it for free. But if you go for free, you, you could be, you
can wait for a long time. You could not actually get in for a while. If you pay subscribe to it,
you get it right away. You can leave it on, on your desktop and thus interact with it whenever
you, you know, it really prioritizes that you get to play with it. Right. I've done some things with
it and, and I've actually done things 3.5 or four and I, it's interesting because four is more
advanced, but I had a story idea and I gave it a title and the earlier version, I liked something
that the earlier version did that the later version didn't do. It, it, it kind of went right to the
point of the idea and then the more advanced version kind of did this thing that was like,
it was kind of a, it gave, it was too much exposition. It did a little too much expository
stuff and I thought, wow, that's so interesting because you're more advanced than this other
version, but I liked what the other version did better, which, which I was surprised that I would
prefer something that an earlier version did, but this is creative was not supposed to be
accurate. It's like more, and then after a while, you know, you see certain, you know, you, I would
wind up saying, no, man, don't do, man, don't, don't do that because don't, don't, you know,
like if you have a prompt, it'll kind of, it's like they say when you're being interviewed,
put the question in your answer, you know, it's like you asked a question, I said, well, the
reason I blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. Right. So you don't have to hear the person ask
the question. But I don't want to. Yeah. So when I ask it to do, if I give a time, I don't want you,
if I describe the story to it, I go, don't put the description of the story in the story. That's
whack. Right. Don't put the description. Don't do, you know, so it's weird. Like it has, it has,
it's limitations. It really does. And if you work with it for a while, you go, oh man, you know,
it's, there's a certain thing that it does. And you go, okay, yeah, just doing that thing. So
interestingly enough, that's why using it to create content is funny because you really have to,
you, you're still involved. You still have to be involved with it because it'll just do a generic
thing. It'll do, it'll go right to just doing something so totally generic. Right. But you
got to give it the inputs. It's like a different way of being creative. You still got to be
creative, but you got to think, you got to almost like a reverse it. There was a photographer
who, a British photographer who won a traditional black and white photography contest with a
completely AI generated image. And they interviewed him. And it was so interesting because he's a
traditional photographer and he's an older gentleman and he was kind of like, man,
I love it. This is great. And he won this contest and he didn't take the prize money. He said,
well, I won the contest, but they wanted that, but he was still enthusiastic about it.
And the interviewer said, so, so, so what is it that you're doing? And he said something so brilliant
and I went right with it. He said, well, I'm, I'm a promptographer. Wow. He said, I'm a prompt
promptographer. So the whole image that did not come out of a camera or the real world.
But the thing is the reason it won is because he knows lighting. He described the exact lighting.
Oh, wow. He described, he described the, the fault. He described the film. He described the lens
that I want to shot with. He, he really, when he prompted it, he, because he's a photographer,
professional, he asked it to do all of these nuanced things. So when you see the image,
the image, it's, it's, it's like, um, it's like a image of two women and one, it looked,
it's like a younger woman and an older woman. Maybe you can find it, Michael.
Yeah. Yeah. He won. Yeah. Look for the, what's his name? Your name? I can't remember his name,
but he, he won, uh, black and white. He won a traditional, that's the image right there.
That one, that's the image. Wow. That looks like a real photograph. Okay. Yeah. It kind of does
look like a painting though. You could see like in a hand. Well, the other hand, well, the problem is
not, it's the hand that's on, um, the other shoulder, what the left shoulder. Yeah. That feels,
but you know, a lot, one of the big flaws with, um, with AI imaging is hands. The hands oftentimes
are off, but the emotion, the way, you know, the, it looks like an old, a weathered photograph.
Yeah. And, and, um. It's even got like a weird like lens flare in there. Yeah. Yeah.
Imperfections in there that you would think it'd be part of the photo. It's brilliant. It's really
brilliant. And the thing is what he, he was the one who, as far as I know, well, I'm sure it was
around before, but he said, you know, I'm a promptographer and I was like, man, that's brilliant.
That is brilliant because it's a different, it's another kind of expression. It's a new
kind of expression. I added promptographer to my thing, photographer and promptographer.
That's incredible. And meet multimedia, you know, uh, it's just, but he, but the thing is
part of the reason why this photo worked so well is because he meticulously described the lighting,
described the lighting and, uh, described, you know, in the, in his prompt for the image.
So that's how it was able to come out and, and people.
How do you even describe that? Like, that's, that's amazing to me. How you could even.
Well, it's like, it's also, it's like, kind of, it's very much like an image from like the 1930s.
Right. Right.
It seems like it's a photo, you know, you know, it's an eight, it's a photograph from
about the 1930s, I would say. Yeah.
And, uh, you know, and it's, um, yeah, the only thing, I mean, the only thing is the, uh, the left
hand, the left hand on the shoulder is, is that's the, that's where that's the only, um, the right
hand is, the right hand on the shoulders is fine. And the difference between her, you know,
the hand of the younger woman and the hand of her mom or aunt or whoever she's supposed to be,
you know, and it's the, it's the positioning of the, uh, the left hand that's problematic.
Right.
But they didn't, but, but they didn't pick up on it. They went, they went for it.
That's so interesting, man.
Yeah. So, yeah. So, promptography is here and, and, and the next thing, and, and this is where
the freak out, the freak out will really come out is when in the image space, when, when video.
Yeah.
When you can describe video and describe, I want to stop motion of a coffee cup going across the
thing. And I want the table to be, I want the table to be made out of teak. And I want, and I
want there to be a follow spot when the coffee cup goes across. When that happens, I mean,
it's already hot. Like the deep fake thing is so convincing already.
It hasn't been able to do, it hasn't, they haven't been able to do frame by frame,
but that's the thing. But given enough computing power, the idea is like, I want this thing,
I make the image and now I want the image to move once that happens. And that to me is the next
frontier. So when that happens, and you're being able to say, I want to shot with a red camera,
or I want it shot with this, or I want to shot with a film camera, I want to stop motion,
and I want it, and you're able to do that. And that can actually go down. We're in the, the, the,
the whole.
What happens to society? Like the people that are able to, that want to manipulate society?
Like I think of the people that control, like the people that are in government or the people
that are part of these, you know, people like, that have control of Twitter, like with these
recent Twitter files where you see like the FBI is working directly with Twitter and the CIA is
working directly with Twitter. And like, if they want to do anything to help people get elected
or whatever their motives could be, they could easily manipulate our population because everybody
is on Twitter. And everybody is seeing this stuff. And like, who knows what's real?
So the thing is, there's a, there's a, there's a place it has to go to first. There's a place it
has to go. See, this is like, oh, the image. Okay. So there's a place it has to go to.
Because you think they would get a hold of it before anybody? That's what, that's what?
Well, they're not creative people, you know what I mean? They're not creative people. The thing is,
the, the place where it's the most interesting and the most troubling, I mean, my artist friends,
half of them are, they are, there's a big lawsuit now because that copyright,
copyrighted images are used to train some, for not, not all of them, but some of the, the AI
image makers, you know, they've used a lot of copyrighted images. Oh, okay. I haven't manipulated.
Yeah. And, and, and right. So what Boyd's interesting is, interestingly enough,
the Smithsonian just released a ton of images to the public domain. The Smithsonian just
did a little like, has, there's a ton of technical images and historical photographs,
there's a whole trove that is now available from the Smithsonian, the National, from the National
Archives. And I would imagine that since these images have been released to the public domain,
that those images will be used for model, for, you know, to train, to be legitimately used
to train the AI without any copyright infringement problems, particularly with photography,
right? Since the stuff is being released to the public domain, domain is being released to the
public domain, right? That using the public, there's a trove of the public domain images
to train AI image makers. It's going to be very interesting. And there are a lot of old film.
So this, that's been released. So I'm wondering to what degree that's going to be taken advantage of
by the AI modeling folks, you know, to kind of get it away from the problems of, of using
artist copyrighted image images. And then again, to go, to be able to go frame by, because they,
there isn't that yet. But the day that there's a program or an app that lets you describe
a scene, even though the scene is 20, you're limited to 20 seconds. That's a revolution.
If you could describe, if you can literally describe what you want and have the AI image
generator create a short film strip, then we're in, then the, this whole conversation
is going to be kicked into another orbit. Absolutely. I agree. Wow, man. The cats,
the cats are not going back in the bottle. No, you're not going to get it back in the
bottle. That's for sure. You know, and so, I mean, there's a certain amount of ethics.
I don't know how the lawmakers are going to, you know, how they're going to be able to wrap
their arms around it. And also, I don't necessarily want it to be super restrictive,
but we have to be aware that there's stuff possible that is not good. There's some stuff
that's, there's a lot of great stuff that's going to come out of it. And a lot of great,
you know, unintended consequences don't necessarily have to be bad. We have a lot of positive
unintended consequences as well. But there's things that are going to come out of all of this
that we, we ain't thinking about it. We're not thinking about it. Right. And we can't, we can't,
we don't know what it's going to be because people are going to, people are going to be clever.
And the person that could turn it just 45 degrees, you know, that person could be
incredible or they could be a problem. Right.
What is your day-to-day life like? How much time do you spend worrying about this stuff?
How much time do you spend? Are you still like making music every day?
Of course, yeah, of course. I play, well, you know,
playing with Living Clown, I just, we just did, we were just in Memphis. We played the Big
Bill Street Festival. And the very next day, I went to Sam Phillips Recording and I produced a session.
A friend of mine, Adam Rubenstein is making a film about the Bar-Kays. And the Bar-Kays were
this band that they were in the playing with Otis Redding. When Otis Redding, that playing,
terrible playing crash in 1967. Right. They were really young. They were really young. And they were
kind of his band for his, you know, for his last, in fact, it was, the crash was in Michigan.
So there's one, there's a surviving member of the bass player, James Alexander. And he, we did a,
they had this big tune in 67, Soulfinger. This is really cool instrumental thing.
And it's really cool tune. And then I produced a version of it for the film, for the documentary
film. Oh, that's amazing. And Adam Rubenstein, his cousin, Ronnie Caldwell. Ronnie Caldwell
was the keyboard player for the Bar-Kays. And he was the one white member of the Bar-Kays.
And he found out from his mom, oh, that's, you know, that guy, that's your cousin. And he went,
you know, and then, you know, kind of Adam went down and it's kind of rabbit hole and,
and he's making, it's a, it's a, it's going to be a great film. I think it's, I am convinced,
because I've seen like a kind of trailer for it. And it's so good. I mean, because
all, all the people that were connected to them, all the people that knew these kids,
they were like 16, 17 years old, you know. And when Otis Redding heard them, he just fell in love
with them. And they said, these guys got to be my band. And you gotta remember, he was just in his
20s. Right. Right. So it's, it was just a very cool thing. And I'm a talking head in the documentary
and in the course of, in the course of making the documentary. I said, you know what, you should
think about doing a version of Soulfinger for the, a new version of Soulfinger for the documentary.
And it just so happened that he was making some interviews and then Living Column,
we were going to be down there. So I stayed an extra day and Mono Neon, incredible lefty-based
player. He's, he's, you should check out Mono Neon's videos on YouTube. He's out of control.
He's out of control. He's like, he's like Bootsy Collins 2.0. If you took Bootsy and Jaco,
like he's crazy, he's crazy down. We won't be able to mistake Mono Neon because his fashion,
he's like a young fashion icon. He's incredible. He's from Memphis and, and the bar case meant a
lot to him. So, so, so he's on this track as well. So James Alexander, who's the last surviving
member of the bar case bass player is on this track with Mono Neon, who's like Mr. Tomorrow on bass.
And there, and a bunch of kids from the Stacks Music Institute also played on the track. So,
so I did that and I'm super, I'm proud of it and I'm really happy and I can't wait to hear it mix.
And, and we recorded it, we recorded it on a board. This is the opposite of tech and AI. We
recorded on a board that was in the Stacks B-room at Sanpa. And this is, this is an old analog board.
It sounds fantastic. And, and a lot of records were cut on this board. So, it was really, really,
really special. And then, coming the summer, you know, Living Color and the band Extreme,
we're going out and doing shows, going out on tour. And at that road of note, we're also gonna,
we're here in Florida, we're gonna be at Disney from 629 to the second. Oh, no way. Yeah. Oh,
that's incredible. Yeah. So, we're gonna be, we're gonna be Living Color, we're gonna do a little
stand-up for Disney. So, what is, what is your like range when it comes to like new music you'll
listen to or experiment with? Like, do you listen to new stuff that comes out? How many different
genres do you dive into? I'm a nut. I'm one of those guys. Like, I wish I was able to experiment
with new music. Whereas like, I'm kind of like the nostalgic type person where I kind of go back
to the things that I grew up listening to. Or like, it's rare that I'll really like dive into
some new album from some new band that I've, I rarely, like a, you mentioned you listen to,
you're listening to the new two-up tool album a couple years ago. I saw you on the podcast.
Yeah. Fantastic. And I was like, I listened to a couple times in high school, but like,
I never dove back into it, but I know I would fucking love tool. Oh, so good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Inoculum. Yeah, that record is good. And I don't know, man, there's a lot of cool stuff out there.
I mean, I'm hearing people, my daughter turns me on to a lot of things. Really? Like, I, like her,
you know, H-E-R, the, she's, she's H period, E period, R period, her. Okay. R&B artist. Crypto
badass guitar player too. She's great. She's, she's like, she's kind of extraordinary because
she's a singer-songwriter, but she's a multi-instrumentals. And there's a, there's actually a clip
of her playing on Saturday Night Live. And I think in the second song, she breaks out a
guitar and she's well, kind of whaling. I was like, what's up? Wow. Yeah, really talented.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's a good, that's a good thing. You know,
you're too young to have a 19 year old, but. Yeah, I am a little bit too young. My oldest is four.
Well, you know what? Your kid's going to connect, keep you connected to,
keep you connected to, to new music. You know, it's funny. There's an artist named Steve Lacey,
who's a guitar player, right? But it's, it's over. My daughter is a huge Steve Lacey fan,
kind of proto-princey, but, but really cool tunes, plays guitar. But she said Steve Lacey,
I was like, you mean the jazz saxophonist? Because there's this very famous in the jazz
circles, play soprano saxophone named Steve, also named Steve Lacey. I was like, what you're talking
about Steve Lacey? What you know? And it's a totally different person. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, so it's
yeah, man. It's, you know, man, and I like heavy things. I like melodic things, like weird things.
There's a band, one of the heavy bands, the two bands that are kind of heavy, the thank you
scientist, insane. It's a very Prague, very, very, very, very, very Prague band, and they're
out of control. And what does that mean? Prague. Prague, you know, kind of a lot of parts,
pretty complicated. Okay. You know, and there's another band called Carbomb.
Carbomb. I feel like I've heard of that. Carbomb, super heavy, and, and, and, and kind of insane.
And, and I kind of like them. So I go from her to Carbomb. Okay. Yeah, you've got a wide variety.
Yeah, a wide, wide variety of things that I like. And I like old, older music. You know,
obviously, I loved working on the bar case thing. So I'm trying to stay, I mean, I just think it's
not even trying to stay. I just dig it, you know, I dig it. I dig it. I dig it. Well, cool, man. Well,
thank you again for coming on here. I really appreciate that. Thank you for having me.
We plan on an hour. We did over two hours. Tell people where they can follow you and find out
what you're doing. You can find me. I'm burnt. I'm burnt 22 on Instagram. I'm burnt 22 on Twitter.
I'm burning read on Facebook. I am burnt 22 on Mastodon, also a great band, but it's an emerging.
Oh, I love Mastodon. Yeah, but emerging social network, there's no one, but Mastodon, the band is
like, you know, crack the sky. Fantastic. Yes. And, and what else? I'm, I'm, I think I'm going to mess
with blue sky. You know, blue skies just come out, you know, but I'm burnt VR and T22. That's me.
Cool, man. I'll make sure I link it all below for everyone who's watching Mastopola.
Fantastic. Thank you. I appreciate it, man. Appreciate you. Good night, world. Peace.
