can pay you directly there but if you want to support the chat the podcast go ahead they said
they want to do an interview in Spanish speak Spanish channel I don't speak Spanish I mean how
so uh explain to me what you got going on what what was the inspiration behind this painting
that you brought in today you brought in four of the same paintings all in different colors
well two of them are the same no they're all different though I mean like she's pink she's
skin tone the other ones magenta purple so I mean they're all they're different colors the
backgrounds are two of them are same yeah yeah it's but they're all different paintings um
do you see what I'm saying yeah so they're all different but uh there's a guy named Robert Smith
who bought do you remember that paint oh I don't think you saw that painting I I sent you the
I think I sent you the um the time lapse where I did it was called angry baby it was a kid that's
crying like screaming so the guy that bought that his name is Robert Smith he bought that and then he
came back after he got it he was like wow you know this is great he said I want a a painting the same
size as same size it was three foot by four foot he said of Rob Zombie's wife blowing a bubble there's
some video he sent me the video and Rob Zombie's wife in the video is blowing a bubble but you
can't see her very well like you can see her but you can only it's a real it's it's cropped real tight
and I thought you know what if I could superimpose her face and and hands over another chick then I
could get like a full body shot it'd be a cooler painting it'd be you know it's more aesthetically
pleasing let's put it that way so I started looking and as I was searching for women blowing you know
bubblegum bubbles and I started searching I came across this image and I looked at it and I I thought
man that I love that image that's a great image so then I took it and I did uh I mass produced
because I'm getting tired of I'm not tired of it the fuck is that a helicopter flying over us I feel
like there's a helicopter landing on top of the building right now it's not me they're coming for
it's not me it's the doctor it's um he's flying in so um he um what's going on
I'm probably getting notifications okay so so anyway yeah I got this and and I got a lot of guys
that are like like they can't afford like 800 bucks they're like hey you know that other painting was
800 bucks or this one's 600 like I can't afford that what can you do for 250 what can you do
something for me for 250 or for 300 it's like no I can't there's nothing I can do for 300 but then
I thought you know what if I take the same design and I just mass produced it like I pay I I paint it
over and over and over again and maybe and it took three or four days but if I can do that over and
over and over again then I can sell those for like 275 and I can mail it to you and it's affordable
and they're all different paintings they're all individual paintings they're the same image
why can't you just couldn't you just create like one really badass painting and then do prints of
them and just sign them all right but but they're they're prints and at some point in the future
I may do prints but for right now it's like to me and I could be wrong it's like I would rather
I would rather have like a piece of artwork yeah people like the live paint right I mean it's a
painting it's a it's a real piece of it's a real piece of art as opposed to a copy and that's really
what it boils down to is it's a copy you put your phone on silent do you mind I can't this is John this
is John Bosey at John Nicole and he can buy some art uh oh well wait he's talking shit on me live
I gotta I know I gotta turn this off he'll hey do you want a sticker for the church of chill
I don't know what that is it's a it's an amazing podcast done by my friend Sean Dunn
and his beautiful girlfriend Cass yes they do a morning live meditation podcast every morning
on the channel Cass is extremely extremely attractive you think I mean she is she is
really attractive but you have different taste so because you got the hots for Katie
Kate Katie where is Katie what happened to Katie we don't we don't bring her around when you're
here I mean Katie was also tall though when she's like five nine or so like yeah like Katie could
take me in a fair fight I can't date a chick they could take me in a fair fight she's too tall for
you five nine she's a giant bro I did their podcast I know how was it it was good they were
stoned the whole time like they kept and I kept saying like am I gonna fail like a what if I get
like a urine test or something like what if I gotta am I gonna fail being around you guys no
you're fine bro you're fine you know but they were they were stoned the whole time they never
stopped for two hours they smoked straight for two hours nice how did you meet them
Tyler oh god how how what were you expecting when you went there to go meet up with these
people did you know anything about them or I had tried to watch their video of Florida man they
or their documentary Florida man you tried to watch it I tried because they're when you punch in
Florida man there's there's like a hundred Florida Florida man and you gotta type in documentary
after I I mean I did I still got tons of them I mean I never I don't I think I may have watched it
I think I did watch part of it but you know and and so Tyler told me about them and I watched it
and they they had won like Tribeca and I thought okay well let me try and find this and I watched
it and you know Tyler by that point had already been like hey I already booked you yeah yeah basically
already booked me you already had it booked you'll check this out you'll be you'll be meeting them
here at this time I don't even know what's going on and basically you know they do documentaries
they own a production company so I figured okay well while I'm there I can pitch one of my other
stories to them which I did pitch and which they're interested in that story it's like a
cocaine cowboy story and the guy's actually in halfway house right now really one of the guys
who is this guy his name is Mike Hudson he's basically he and his brother Doug were they were
they're like cocaine cowboys but back in the um in the in the late 70s and 80s they were in Miami
and they were like they know all those guys all the guys um all the big time uh cocaine cowboys
and drug dealers everything they were taking boats out and loading up the boats uh with the
Median cartel was loading up boats and they're bringing it into Miami and their mother was
running the whole operation bro it's an amazing story it's an amazing story it's crazy how many
people that we've met and even had on here that were somehow affiliated with the Median cartel
oh it was a huge massive operation yeah I mean these guys it Doug's brother you wouldn't know this
but um so Jesse Jackson ran for president back in the 80s right right um so I'm sorry Mike's
brother Doug has actually been in three different um he's been in three different Caribbean prisons
he's escaped from two of them and the third one Jesse Jackson flew into Cuba
convinced cash row to hand over 22 or 23 prisoner American prisoners that he had been
holding in his prisons put him on his plane and flew him back to the United States
Mike Hudson's brother Doug Hudson was one of those guys and um this guy uh Robert Young Bobby Young
was the second guy now all of them are run by his mother ran an entire crew of guys
Mike Hudson was uh he was in the dirty dozen I mean you know listen their whole story doesn't
it's a motorcycle game okay their whole story is just it's just it's just this amazing epic journey
that puts like the cocaine cowboys like that story it just it's just I don't want to say it puts it
to shame because that was a great story but that was more about Miami and these guys just have this
epic journey that goes on for about 10 or 15 years listen Mike's been in prison he's been in
in Arizona state prison Florida state prison and done two federal bids I mean this guy this
guy's amazing I remember when I did the research on him he told me a story I'll just do this real
quick he told me like sometimes you hear stories right like guys will tell you stories and you know
you're sitting there I'm sitting there writing the story I'm taking notes and you know halfway
through the story it's like cut this it's like cut this shit bro this isn't real you're bull you're
bullshit this is like a Clint Eastwood movie you didn't and he's telling me that he was backing
his jaguar up in the into a parking space and a couple of rednecks beeped at him and he flipped
in the bird or they flipped him a bird whatever they pull over and get out three guys come up to him
and say if you saw Mike Hudson he's a 5 foot 10 version of Clint Eastwood only he looks meaner
is meaner and at about 20 pounds of just solid muscle the guy's a beast so these three guys come
up to him on the street and they go hey motherfucker why you go you should have burned up me now huh
what you got what you got and he goes that don't just just get out of here just get out of here
don't don't you know you don't want none of this they're like yeah you got something and so Mike
fuck boom he punches one in the face guy drops the other guy swings at him he catches him in the
shoulder he punches that guy guy goes down he chases the other guy into a Piccadilly you
know Piccadilly like a restaurant the guy pulls a knife out and starts swinging on Mike takes the
knife away and smashes him in the face just so happens that there's two cops eating they jump
up grab both of them and while they're being dragged out of the restaurant the kid mouths off to him
again and Mike pops him knocks out his two front teeth now this is a story Mike told me
and I thought you're telling me yeah right at four like 40 years old you beat the crap out of
three 25 year olds stop it that never happened so then but I had ordered all the freedom of
information acts one day I get one in from Miami and not only do I have the police report where he
beat these got three guys asses in the middle of downtown Miami I have a transcript from when one
of the guys sued Mike and in the transcript the very end of it he describes exactly what Mike said
in the very end of it he though one of the lawyers says to him do you regret pulling over and
confronting mr. Hudson and he says well of course I do I'd still have my two front teeth
it's just like damn this is amazing like it's like and of course if you met Mike you you talked to
him for 10 minutes you'd be like yeah I can see this I can I can see him swinging on these guys
getting into a fight and the whole thing but he's he's the guy's a beast he's a beast when is he
getting out he's he's in the halfway house right now he he and his brother I'm trying to put together
a with Cass and her whole group because the truth is I don't even know what's it what's
what's her boyfriend's name like I don't even know who Sean is like I don't know if Sean was
I mean if if Cass and Sean are in the room I'm just talking to Cass I don't even know who Sean is
I mean it's like hey so what are we doing creepy old man I'm telling you I you saw her so um so
anyway I was just thinking who's watching this they're probably watching it how it's watching
it nope all your girlfriends are watching it oh that's the you know tinder dates tinder that was
a great segue we should talk about your latest I don't have they've like I kicked off all the
so they banned Matt you're making youtube videos now on your youtube channel right where you're
basically telling your personal deep depressing stories of of your failed relationships I mean
it is very depressing you talk about being depressed I mean yeah I'm depressed but you know I'm by
this by nightfall I'm over it it's in the morning when I'm ready to shoot myself thank god I can't
have a gun I thought it was the opposite I thought you were telling me when you were in prison at
night no I said I wake up in the morning it's like everything I can do to get out of bed I talked I
start talking myself through the day I still do it to this day I lay in bed for 10 minutes thinking
coffee you've got coffee it's just in the next room you like coffee you know and eventually I
pull myself out of bed I go in I start every day every day every day you wake up depressed and
how long does it last sometimes it's worse than others because you're I mean no no this was
happening when he was in prison no this is prison it still happens now it still happens
depression you don't get over it you're always depressed or you're medicated
so I don't want to I don't want to take the medication I'm afraid
rot my brain or something I'll be 70 years old and they'll find out and then suddenly I have
Parkinson's are you still going to a psychiatrist no I only needed to do that for I only had to do
that for a year do you miss going the psychiatrist no I don't think it was good for you at all she
was trying to make me you know be a better person and I'm not interested in that I can't you can't
fix this I told her I said what you can't fit I'm not gonna I can't be a scumbag for like 50 years
I get out of prison I'm gonna talk to you for a year and you're gonna you're gonna change my
behavior plus I don't want to change it's working for me I like me yeah no but you do like talking
about shit you like talking about yourself you like talking about things you do and your feelings
and sometimes that feels good you know the subtle mocking is what you know kits me no I'm being
serious hey oh I don't know who that is Austin's girlfriend's here Austin's girlfriend
I thought there was Katie but she's too short to be Katie yeah Katie would have had a hunch to get
through the door I can't believe you think she's fucking tall she is she's like five nine Katie's
not that tall no I mean she's probably my height how tall are you I'm five ten it's ridiculous
it's for a woman she's in a good pair she's not that tall no she's probably five nine five eight
listen if you're five seven you're a giant to me so listen to this this is this was uh this really
struck me I was talking to Matt on the phone like a couple weeks ago and he was talking to me how
his previous girlfriend broke up with him and you can tell well yes I want you to tell a full
story about that in a minute all right but um he's talking about all these dating apps how it's so
hard for him you'll tell the story but I asked him like Matt a fucking dating app just why don't
you just go to like go to the bar and try to chat up some lady at the bar by a drink Matt's response
to me was I'm five five I can't five six I'm five five foot six I can't go to a bar and pick up chicks
oh come on I'm like a little fucking mansion it's like what what are they gonna so so what I'm
gonna pick the tall guy every time can you unpack that statement for me as soon as the
outlaw starts blowing he goes nah he's six one you're five ten he's five ten you're six one
and you guys are not six are you serious yeah it's a fucking freak show can you can you do me a
favorite hold on can you do me a favorite and explain that statement to me what unpack that statement
for me I'm gonna steal that I'm using that I mean why say explain when you say unpack go ahead
when you said when you said you can't go to a bar and chat up ladies because you're five six the
average height of a woman is like five six and they're all wearing heels so let's face it already
they're staring down at me right unless I want to wear platform shoes so which I'd wear if it wasn't
so obvious just going to the wrong bar wrong bar what the one where they were the dirty foot bar
I'll go to the dirty foot bar where they wear flip flops show me where that bar is on the beach
yeah he's right first of all you know the other problem is going to a bar you go to a bar yeah
what bar are you going to where everyone's wearing high heels hey you're going to Tampa and
shit no I don't go to bar never I've been to a bar in 20 years you're probably thinking like the
nightclub I'm I'm gonna bar in 20 years I'm saying in general time out get you a five six over there
right now people are hating on you boys let me tell you they're gonna be like shut up hat rack
fucking quit asking questions and not let cocks respond all right we can't talk over cocks okay so
listen the what the fuck did I drive over here it's an hour to get here anyway so what I am saying
is this is that if you hang out at a bar and you talk to one or two women the entire time you're
there what are the what's the likelihood that you end up hooking up this has got to go on for months
and months before you end up finding a chick that you like first of all not just knocking them off
I'm not talking about knocking them off okay that's not that's not that's not that's not that difficult
what I'm talking about is some a chick that you like that you want to hang out with that you want
to spend the rest of your life with because I'm 51 years old bro I'm 51 years old you can't even
understand the problems that I have I women have to get over multiple things first of all
you went to prison for scratch that first of all multiple felonies on the run for three years
oh six million dollars which I'm good for went to prison for 12 and a half years got out at 50 49
now 51 I've been out of prison for 18 months starting your life over lived in someone's spare
room was driving a car that didn't have abs or a radio that worked or ac luckily I just got a new
car still not a great car but the point is at least it's not a death trap so I mean so I mean I
just got an apartment just got a new vehicle I'm everything I have is brand new and I don't have
that much I mean I'm struggling so when you go in if I wanted to go in just completely bs somebody
sure but I go in and I'm just very honest about this is the situation you know yeah but don't you
think that's interesting don't you think that's an interesting thing to have a conversation with
somebody about your story but at my age listen if a chick's over 35 years old she's starting to think
she's starting to realize look it's it's a downhill slide at this point I got to find a guy that's
stable that is not a complete maniac right and everything about me says that's not what I don't
think that's what all 35 plus-year-old women are looking for at bars no I'm the ones that you
want to end up with the ones that are bars that are picking up some guy just want to want to go
home and get the shit banged out of them I mean you know but that's not the chick that you're
probably going to end up with not that you couldn't end up with that not that I'm I'm opposed to that
I'm just saying just putting that out there but I'm saying in general I'm trying I need to find a
chick that I'm gonna be with because I don't have time to go ahead have a three-year relationship
have it not work out struggle for six months to find another chick date her for four years and by
that time I'm 60 years old I'm gonna be 60 years old trying to so what's the problem with all the
dating apps that you're using all the dating apps I I was on this on several dating apps
fucker so I was on several dating apps I met this chick we went to go meet she asked me for my phone
number she reversed directed directoried me I don't know is that thing yeah whatever
found out my name and didn't show up just rude like you couldn't send a text say listen this is
what's going on didn't show up instead she turned around she contacted the FBI
match.com she got contacted two of the two of the apps we're both on within a day I'm knocked off
both of them for violating the policy which is you're not allowed to be a felon and then the
third one it took another couple days before guess what boom knocked off that one now I went back on
bumble changed altered everything slightly right like it was still Matt Cox and that sort of thing
but I altered some of my information so that it let me back on was on for about three weeks
and then boom shut me off so you know was it another chick because you'll see a lot of these
chicks on different websites did one of these chicks know me did she was she on the website did
she come across me I don't know so I was talking to I mean it's funny that the the the advice
unsolicited advice that I get constantly is like I either get the the you should be very honest up
front and just weed through them and this and that and it's like okay well I mean that that that
trust me I tried that it doesn't work or you should not say anything the psychiatrist the
the the federal government psychiatrist told me date these women for at least three or four dates
let them get to know you and then tell them and I went so let's face it by the first second by
at least the second date you're having sex so you want me to sleep with this chick two or three
times and then tell her I just got out of prison I don't see a problem with that I I do I think
that that's extremely intrusive I think it's it's it's it's first of all it's misleading so I'm
somebody who has a problem with people believing me and with credibility so I need to start the
relationship off with a lie that that's that's not right so look now let me put this way this is
what I told my friend Stacy the other day because she was trying to give me advice which she always
does which is typically horrible advice but she's trying to give me advice and she's like well just
say this you can subtly answer this way you can mislead them this way you can you can manipulate
the conversation you're very good at this and you get okay great so if here's the thing there's no
little bit of fraud all right there's no gray area you've either committed fraud or you haven't so my
what I told Stacy is if I go back on a dating an app I'm going to create a completely new
Instagram Facebook new name Gary Sullivan Gary Sullivan the I'm a Gary Sullivan the whole thing
I'll set up an entire thing I'll just fake the entire thing and I'll date the chick for fucking
three months until she's deep deep in and then I'll say boom gotta mention something to you
I'm not good then I'll club yeah then you club her over the head why would I possibly
go out with her for a week because you're gonna lose you're gonna lose a ton of them that way
and then you still have to find something that you like how many women have you dated
that you like that you're in a committed relationship right now that you feel this
is the person and I'm assuming that you date a lot date no not too often no okay so you're
smashing chicks chain hasn't been on a date or hooked up with a girl in probably half a decade
that's not true you were with that chick the the lot the other time we were here yeah I'm sure
you that didn't turn out no it didn't but that's what I'm saying is that how many women have you
gone through and you haven't found this right and you don't have any of the problems I have
Matt have you ever tried going to the strip club do you don't meet actually I did date a stripper
for three years I actually was engaged to that story too she's a really nice girl she's just
get a mail order a mail order bride yeah yeah listen cut out the middle just go for look Matt's
got a newfound moral compass and if I had this look no honestly if if I was a multimillionaire
I would go with some Eastern European chick that's a mail order bride because look they're vicious
but at least you have an arrangement you say look I'm gonna marry you we're gonna stay married
for three years then I'm swapping you out for another one I'll send you off with some real estate
and and a 401k or an IRA a Roth IRA I'll set you up over the next three to four years and
then we go over back there we pick up another chick we'll swap you out and you're good I mean
she's an indentured servant for three to four years whatever it takes I'm saying I don't wouldn't
mind that because it's an arrangement I get that that's okay I'd be okay with that but I'm not a
multimillionaire and have bringing some first it takes thousands tens of thousands of dollars to
go over there you find the girl you got to bring her over here she has to go back for 10 days or
so she has to come back over she's got to be five two it's a whole thing well look I'll take five
six and under so how long were you dating your previous girlfriend I don't want to like say her
name I don't want to air her out or anything like that doesn't you go on my channel ever
put her all over your channel she's all over my channel she she texted me today when I released
the video today because I made some crack about how it's not my fault that she's there's an issue
between the two of us were you guys dating I don't know like about 14 15 months and then why did
why did you guys end up breaking up I thought look listen any relationship there's like ebbs
and flows right like sometimes it's amazing and then sometimes you know it's it's good but it's
not as good as it was at one time like there's obvious right like what not bad but sometimes
you're more over the top in love than others so we would have a couple of great weeks and then
we'd have a week where we didn't talk or even see each other for a week what's going on just reading
okay nothing keep going so so there would be times when we were texting you know whatever five
10 times a day as opposed to she's texting me 30 times a day and calling me and saying I can't
wait to see you and you know I love you so much and you know that so those things are going back
and forth but it's a good relationship in my opinion listen one day what first of all this kills me
she wants to move in like we're dating there was an issue with this chick she was dating right so
she was dating this chick when we met and then she broke up with her to be with me and then
the girl came back around and she's like look I'm gonna be with her and I'm sorry and I'm like
you're messing up but whatever she was a bisexual right and then she comes back again
like a week later she's like I messed up I screwed up forget her I'm sorry I'm in love with you and
then so that went on for a few months eventually she comes back and I'm like look we're done I mean
you know this I'm tired of this she's like no you don't understand I'm all in I want to move in
together I'm in love with you it's I messed up I screwed up great so a few months later we tell
our PO's that we're seeing each other okay because we're both on probation we have to get permission
so we get our get permission then I say I'm gonna go rent out I'm gonna we're gonna rent an apartment
she's then she starts back peddling well I'm about to go to start school full time and I don't know
and what about my half of the rent and this and that and give it let's give it another month and
then okay another month goes by and then another month goes by and then I said look I I gotta move
out of I'm living in someone's bedroom I gotta get out of here you know so I'm gonna rent an apartment
you're moving in with me she's like I can't afford my half of the rent I just started school
I'm like I'll pay your half of the rent and she's like well the problem is my dad I live with my dad
I'm so close and my car is a piece of junk and your car is a piece of junk we'll get you a new car
I'll I'll I'll help you with the car payment then it comes back it's like no I can't afford that
I'll pay the car payment now what I just need more time I need more time back at her into a corner
oh yeah of course what am I gonna look look it's put up a shut up if I'm in I'm a hundred percent
I'm all in I mean I've said this before if I'm going in the bank I'm not slipping the fucking

I'm having a good time my girlfriend's here we just had sex everything's good that's about to
change yeah we just everything's good like we just I knocked one out we're gonna go eat going back
life's good life's good sure enough we sit down and I said you want to talk and she goes
she and I said what would you want to talk about and she goes maybe we shouldn't talk here
and I went what I said what do you want to throw a fit I said what are you breaking up with me
and she goes yeah and I went what we just ordered and I was like oh no oh look I went
what and she goes I just it's just not working and I just don't feel like we're gonna this is
gonna last and I did I went oh so hold on hey hey to the secretary to the not secretary to the
waitress I go hey I said can you back box all that stuff up and get me the tab as soon as humanly
possible and she goes is everything okay I said yeah we're just wrapping this up real quick this is
over so I need that stuff so we can get going as quickly as possible I appreciate it and she went
she got the stuff and came back and Jess is just sitting there staring at me she's like do you
want what do you want to talk about I said there's nothing what's there to talk about you don't want
to be with me I've been through this before we've been through this this is a real we had a good
year since the last one but this is it so sure enough we get our stuff we go back we walk into
the house she's sitting there she's like do you want to talk about this what's there to talk about
do you have any of your stuff that you need to get it's over if it's over it's over and you know
I was furious so then she left and then a couple days later I start getting the text from her are
you okay I know you're upset my dad said that I probably shouldn't call you and I said yeah you're
right you shouldn't call me there's no reason to text and we're done a couple more days then you
know she starts posting stuff on Facebook and she starts and he goes back and then I'm like
you know what are you doing then we start talking again and then she comes over a few times here
and there and we're talking and then we stop talking and then we have another this and this
goes on for another it's been going on for a month or so it's you know it's just not it's like
she doesn't know why she doesn't want to be with me but she does want to be around me and see me
and text me and and and be around you know and you know listen we basically have the same relationship
we had before only the difference is I'm currently gonna try and define another chick she doesn't
like the commitment right but here's the thing this is a chick that's works she works and goes to
school all day all like it's like there's not somebody else you know it doesn't make sense her
whole thing is I don't see us being together for the rest of our lives okay we're too different
that's what she says that's what she says we're too different so she's like that I don't see us
having a successful relationship because we're too different right I understand so what you're
saying is that like a housewife and a guy that sells insurance they don't have anything in common so
they can't be together you're saying that a secretary and a guy who's a garbage man that
live together and have a 40 year relationship and raise three kids they can't be together because
they don't have anything you're telling me that only people that both are mechanics can survive
a relationship are you so you and your wife must have the identical backgrounds and careers right
no you don't that's right right that's right that's not how it works so the fact is it doesn't make
sense so it's like nothing she's saying makes sense you know she's saying I'm in love with you
I'm attracted to you I I love talking to you and hanging out with you and you know it's like
okay so what's happening she's comfortable with you and all that stuff is true but she doesn't
want anything she doesn't want to get married and have kids with you maybe she wants to get married
and have kids but she wants maybe she wants to have some like somebody else some younger guy
a taller guy and I thank you what a dickhead I don't think hey don't think I haven't had that
conversation I was like I was like give me a reason tell me you want a guy that's six foot tall
tell me you want a guy that's uh uh that's a mechanic or you know which is what she's going to
school to be like a mechanic like tell me that you want a guy tell me that I have bad breath
tell me that I'm too old for you I that's a told that's a real issue for me yeah I said you're
she's 34 and I'm 51 I'm like tell me that that makes sense and she's like what are you talking
about you don't even look 51 she's like you you look you we look like we're the same age practically
she's like I don't look 34 and you don't look 51 she was that's not it she's like you're amazing
you're a great person you're great that hairline's not a day older than 25 it shouldn't be it cost
14 grand best bank of america so I need to finish one oh this one's full okay yeah so it doesn't
make sense but whatever it's never gonna make sense but it's not that makes sense it's none of my
business whatever so yeah it's an issue but the problem is like I posted that video today
and this uh other chick that I'm talking to saw the video of course which I knew she was gonna
and then she called me and she's like it sounds like you're not really over this chick and I'm like
well no way of course I'm not over I mean we dated over a year I'd be a complete nut job if I was
just over or just like that it's dragging out so how did you meet this this new chick
she watched me on concrete really I've actually had a couple of women boziat came in here two
weeks or a week ago he met his girl off the show yeah boziat come in here a week ago with some new
girl he met she she DM'd him from the concrete podcast she saw his podcast on here with you and
him and right now they're together right I mean that's that's you know but I mean the the other
it's just and I'm going to the wedding yeah this is a chick that I'm just talking like I've talked
to a couple of chicks but I haven't seen them I haven't gone out with them I haven't done anything
I mean just they're just we're just communicating you know like they're in other states right this
other chick's in another state but didn't you meet a girl for a blind date off one of those apps
wasn't a blind date it was during my three weeks that bumble let me slip back in there
and then get just in that so how did that how did that play out um let's see I went on a couple of
of they're not blind dates they're like they're apt or whatever they're not a blind date but you've
never seen the person in real life before right no not in real life but they were that didn't get
catfish it was her um so I went on a couple dates but the problem is I went on the dates
and like I went on the dates and I'd broken up with like Jess like oh or just broken with me like
two weeks earlier or a week and a half earlier so I go on some date with some girl and she's
talking and talking and I'm not even paying attention and and at the end of the date I'm
like okay well hey it was nice meeting you I give them a hug and I just head back to my car and
they're standing there like what's going on and I'm just like it's I'm not feeling it like that
like I might as well have gone to dinner with my sister tell me about the uh the tell me the story
about the girl you met who was a Scientologist okay now that was the one of the best dates I've
that was the out of the two or three date the three there was three days but out of that three dates

really yeah she was hot I mean like extremely like usually you get there and you're like oh

yeah I don't need some something ridiculous so okay so yeah so anyway how old was she I want to
say she's in her oh I think she was like 41 42 years old actually I think she was so let's say 40
okay um she had her shit together Scientologists they have their of course yeah she's definitely
she was sharp as a tack and we sat down we started talking and this is what was so funny was I had
mentioned during our commerce our texts she had said you seem great you seem this I said yeah well
it's not all it cuts that it sounds I said trust me there's there's an issue and she's like well
what's the issue I said I'll I'll mention it to you it when we meet in person so we talked for
about two hours like we had dinner and about about an hour and a half into it let's say
hour and a half into it maybe two hours she says you seem so funny and great like we were having
a great time and she goes she said well what's the issue and I went what's the catch here talks I
said all right here's here's here's the catch and I explain like you know here's what's going on
boom boom I go through the hole on the run in cars I knocked it I didn't in 30 minutes like I'm
maybe the 30 minute version because the two hour version will freak you out I said I'm going to go
with 30 minutes here and she goes okay she goes she says I'm ready I said okay so I tell her the
30 minute version boom give her the 30 minute version and and at the end of it she goes look
I'm not going to lie she said that that that gives me pause she said but you know I mentioned to you
that I'm a sign anti-ontologist you saw and people some people have issues with that she said so
she said I told you that up front you know because I wanted you to know that
she said so but this is this is that's a big one I said it is a big one and she goes
let me think about it let me think about it she's about it I think I'm gonna be okay with it she's
but let me think about it she's I have to kind of have to kind of pass it by she had a consult with
Xenia she had basically had to talk to you know it she didn't say in my opinion she made it sound
like she had to pass it by someone right yeah she talked to Xenia the galactic overlord I don't
know who that is so Elron Hubbard I understand I understand the mocking um but the point is is that
she we talked listen 30 we talked for the we talked for actually for another two hours and
change so about 30 minutes later we're talking and I remember at one point she stopped and she
just leaned in and she goes do you feel the chemistry between us and I went I go yeah I
it's like that's nuts right and she goes it is it's crazy she's like I never feel this way she
was and I I feel this this is this is great chemistry and I go right so then this goes on we
end up going into the bar we sit in the bar we talk for another hour in the bar we're leaning in
and talking and finally she says listen she says I have to go is she are you guys drinking
at the bar I know you don't drink but did she drink I think she had like a what because she
found me interesting because she's a Scientologist I'm interested to see if Scientologists drink
I don't know if she drank or not she might have had a glass of wine I don't recall her drinking
to be honest but whatever I'm into the details Matt's okay okay so well we went to the bar we
sat down we had a Diet Coke I don't know what she had um so we were talking but I mean literally
like another hour or so into that conversation she ends up saying she is look she is it's late
I'm gonna have to go she is and honestly she said the chemistry between us is so overwhelming she
is I I feel like like we're gonna she is I'm gonna kiss you here she's if I don't leave soon and I
was just like I was like well what you have to understand too we're we've got the mask she goes
to the church she can't go to the church if she's had like contact with me right so they have all
these rules about that they're trying to keep from getting like nobody in that in the church has gotten
COVID okay because they're extremely stringent on the rules and so she so anyway I said okay I said
yeah okay that's cool um and we leave and she gets in her car and she leaves and she says look
she's I'm gonna call you tomorrow she said it went you know like I go when do you want to see each
other again she said like probably this weekend I mean she said I gotta ask some people at the
church how like about talking was it you know what I'm saying like talking like like how like
actually being with you like connecting with you like I need to find out exactly what the
rules are like how closely I can get how close I can get to you the whole thing she said I
gonna need to find out exactly what those rules are she said but yeah probably like like this
weekend she's I definitely want to see you again I said okay cool so that's it the next day
she sends me a text she says I had an amazing time you're an amazing guy the chemistry was
overwhelming she said I find you extremely attractive interesting she says you're just
an amazing individual all the way around she says and I know that this isn't gonna make sense at all
she's but I'm afraid we're gonna have to keep this in the front zone she said it's just I know it
doesn't I can't explain why it's I just have to it just can't go any further than where it is right
now and I'm so sorry and she's I understand if you'd be upset about that but I would really
like to keep you as a friend and I went slow game so I said I said let me let me explain
something my my personal you know philosophy on having hot female friends is that there's just
nothing more useless in the world than having a hot chick as a friend because while they think
you're building a friendship you're I'm thinking how am I gonna fuck this chick so I said it's
absolutely useless for you to be a friend I said but if you're serious about it I'll make an attempt
to be friends however if it's the kind of friend that sends me three texts a week to say hey what's
up and I say oh everything's good and that's it I said I got enough of those useless friends already
I said now if you want to actually be a friend yeah of course why what do I care this shit's done
so I said you know if you want to be if you want to meet have dinner if you want to bounce
business ideas because she had some great business ideas like she like when I talked to her about my
artwork she rich I mean I didn't get into her kind of car did she drive the fuck is going on
bro do you are do you really sit there at the first date and say so what's your financial
set how much do you have in the bank what's in your 401k I don't I'm asking yeah that's how it
works now Matt not well Scientologists are rich only yeah they are bro are you kidding me the higher
ups bro a lot of Scientologists are richest fuck not the ones that walk up and down the street in the
fucking in the white clothes no not those those are just the slaves wait there's literally slaves in
Scientology you don't know that tell her you'll take the the brain zapping test and shit if that's
what they want yeah get audited listen did you know what they don't want me as a member did she
say she's I wouldn't be a member of any church that would have me as a member did she say that
she's ever seen any of your videos online no I'm no she hadn't seen anything she didn't know
anything about me remember she only knew my name was Matt that's all she knew until that night so
Scientologists aren't allowed to use the internet from what I hear that's not true bro that's not
true I talk to this chick all the time like I I texted her do she have YouTube yeah she's got
you she's watched my stuff now oh oh she's watched my stuff she used listen she's got like a real
corporate job she doesn't work for Scientology she has a corporation corporate job I mean she
it must have been a while ago but I interviewed multiple people on here uh one of the guys Ron
Miscavige I interviewed he's the dad of David Miscavige who is the fucking overlord of Scientology
right you're probably the reason she won't fucking see me they probably found I'm connected to you
and probably they're like oh no he's connected to for sure to Danny Jones you're matchmaking over
here I'm actually she destroyed my fucking match I've interviewed I've interviewed set it up
you know we laid it up to you anyways all these guys people tell me that the Scientologists that
maybe it's just the ones who live at the like the actual church the people who live there like
their residents they're not allowed to use the internet like they have internet but it's very
limited like they can't use YouTube or anything like that and their search options are limited
all right so Scientology is no more ridiculous than Christianity it is a little bit different
I didn't say different I didn't say it wasn't different ridiculous I said it's no more ridiculous
right and then a man dying on the cross for our sins raising up three days later we eat his
we eat his his flesh to cleanse our stuff get out of here that's craziness the bible
the bible actually has like stories the bible which was written by the apostles
four or five hundred years after they had all died an ancient relic full of basically fiction
there's about eight or nine different gospels and then the council of I think it was the council of
Troy they the Catholic church said oh that's a bad one let's go with the best of out of the eight
let's go out of the eight to twelve let's go with the best of let's go with these four
like they picked them there's there are other gospels that paint Jesus as a guy that strikes
children blind for bumping into him in the street that that's just a vicious no there's a lot of
fucked up shit in the right no is it nothing but Bible I'm talking about the other gospels that
didn't make the cut they don't paint Jesus as this sweet guy they don't paint them as the hippie
stoner let's all love and and hug each other and hug it out I mean they paid him vastly different
so I'm saying Scientology is it does it sound kind of kooky yeah but so does any if you really
look at any other religion they're all nuts they none of them all make sense no but Scientology is
is I don't even think you can categorize it in the same realm as those religions because first of
all it was created it was created as a business by a guy who is the most prolific writer of science
fiction you mean history of the world it sounds to me like you're almost talking about the Catholic
church how's how so how so the the Catholic Church like it don't they own banks don't they is
isn't it a massively rich corporation the Catholic Church it's not a business it's not built like
a Ponzi scheme like Scientology is where you have to pay for certain levels to ascend to a certain
are you height what because you don't like their business literally built like a Ponzi scheme it's
a business that became if it was right which is by the way gone through the courts and been deemed
by your federal government that it is a church right after they had they basically had thousands
of their members sue the IRS so they could achieve that tax-free status okay and and how is that any
different then so so Scientology you know one of the things I had heard about it was like
there's like like there's sex slaves and there's this and there you mean like having an entire
portion of of the Catholic Church priests give up all of their money to the Catholic Church
and live with nothing have no possessions that's kind of like slaves isn't it it's crazy or it's
crazy what belief will do wait a minute what about this what about this what about every time
that a child is sexually molested we just move the priests from one place so he can sexually
molest more children and when there's more accusations we move him again and again and again
that's no different than the the kind of stuff that's going on in the in the uh in Scientology
I'm saying it's all whacked to say that no no no they're horrible and these other things are good
come on bro every preacher out there's robin that their church or parish blind I mean it's
constantly happening so you know to point one out because Elron Hubbard came up with it I mean yeah
okay it's not just because Elron Hubbard came up with it there's lots of crazy shit in Scientology
that doesn't happen just like in in every other religion like for example for example if you leave
Scientology or if you're in Scientology and you have someone in there that commits one of the
science that breaks one of the rules or leaves you have to disconnect from them where you cannot
have any communication with them or anybody else like you have to literally disconnect completely
it's I've had people on here who talked about who have left right I understand and I mentioned
this chick who was in the church so here's what she had said when I said to her um I said well I
don't understand I said you're you're on a date with me I'm like you're not thinking of converting
me she goes I was married to a guy who's Muslim she was I was married to a Eastern a Middle Eastern
man who was Muslim she was for eight years she goes he didn't go to the she was and I've always
been in Scientology this chick's father was in was a Scientology she said I never tried to convert
him I never tried to get him in the church she goes and and I said yeah but I said I have a friend
named Stacy and Stacy told me that at some point they will tell you as you ascend they will eventually
tell you you have to disassociate with anybody who's not Scientologist she goes yeah that's not
true either it's not anybody who's not Scientologists there's only people who speak negatively
about Scientology absolutely that's what she said she said if I'm with someone and they start
talking negatively about Scientologists and try and get me to get out of Scientology she goes
I have to have a conversation with them where I say look you have to stop this behavior
or I just can't talk to you anymore right you have to disconnect right and to me
that makes sense like if you're gonna mock my my religious belief then I just can't be around
you anymore I mean you truly are a believer in anything if I was a a true believer in Catholicism
and every time I hung out with Danny he was like oh what's going on with Jesus oh hey do your fingers
hurt do your hands hurt can you wear the holes in your hands hey what's about stigmata and you
started mocking me then eventually I would say Danny you gotta stop doing this and if you say well
and I'm not going to I'd say okay we'll cut kick rocks we're done okay but what if you did what if
you did an interview with somebody or wrote a wrote something online questioning Catholicism
or questioning anything about it and then she has to disconnect from you completely
I mean I don't know I don't know the complete I don't know exactly I mean it's not I mean
you're trying to make it sound like mocking or like always like ridiculing or whatever I mean
it's even if you question it publicly they have to completely you have to completely disconnect and
if like I've had a guy on here who his entire family is still in Scientology he left and that
they he hasn't had contact with any of them since like they they do things where they send people
out to his house with cameras to literally stalk him and follow him everywhere he goes
and that happens to numerous people I mean it may happen I didn't I don't have enough information
to make a informed decision it's crazy how much more shit they do like hiring private investigators
to follow people around armed filming them confronting them at their homes I mean it's
fucking wacky bro bad things happen bad things do happen especially in Scientology
everywhere I mean I don't know we're not gonna solve this we're not we don't have to solve it
I need another bud light you know bud help me out they're ready for the paintings I mean I mean

What's going on like you sound like a psychopath? Yeah, you sent me you sent me a
five word sentence
Like you know like basically where I feel like you know I looked into your eyes, and I can tell where kindred spirits call me
Calling you psycho you're gonna have me in the middle in a well somewhere asking me to rub lotion on my fucking skin
Absolutely, not hey. Do you think the Scientology girl come on the podcast?
Never come on the pot. She's she's she's pretty she's uh can we call her?
There's no matter if I if I sit if I think even talking about her may have been did someone just cash at me 69 cents
nice
69 cents
That's awesome. They deserve a picture that should draw them. It was probably a dollar and it took money out
It was hurtful though is what it is. Okay, um, so let me think what is her name?
Okay, let's go
I'm currently doing a live podcast
with concrete
period and
Danny comma with concrete comma would like to call you period
What are your thoughts question mark?
This should be good
We're gonna get a Scientologist live on the call on the on the podcast on the call in
So have you guys hung out never gonna let you all tell me this have you guys have you guys seen each other since that first date?
No, she's not allowed to see you again. You're done
Yeah, probably. Yeah, you're right
That's like was way too hot and someone just sent me and way to Scientologists out nice
I mean, you know and the funny thing is is I know I'm supposed to be appreciative. So I appreciate that. Thank you very much
But he's really not I'm just I think it's it's I have a guy that every time I post he sends me two dollars
Really? Yeah, well one time you send me five dollars. He goes because that was an exceptional video
Didn't you actually appreciate because it adds up a couple cups of coffee a month
Didn't you just do some fucking commercial for some home security company?
Yeah, yeah, right
So a home security company
Yeah, they hired you and flew you out to Oklahoma, right? Well, it was it. It's tight. It's called
It's called home title lock. So it's like life lock but for your home. So it protects people
Against the crimes that I actually committed. I actually met Newt Gingrich. What?
Yeah, Nate Gingrich, right? Like Newt Gingrich was like a hundred years old when I was young
And so when they told me Newt Gingrich is gonna be interviewing you I went
And they were like he's 77, but yeah, he's actually he's he's he's doing good. He's he's doing well
He sounds like that's nuts. Wow. What was that like? It was it was fine
He was you know, nice guy. There were two FBI agents there. It's nice to talk to an FBI agent when they're not looking for you
So, you know, I met a bunch of people is like a huge production. They flew me in I stayed two nights
I only worked one day
so, you know, it was it was
It's cool. It was in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, which is really a nice city
Like I really felt like Oklahoma City was like gonna be like scummy
Bro, everywhere I went nice clean
Everybody's polite
Well, they're very nice, huh? I've never been I mean, I've been before but it was I when I was
Flown in by the BOP and the con air and they
Unloaded me into the holdover for two weeks and then loaded me back on the plane and flew me out
So I didn't get to see a lot of the city on that trip
You get to see many sites, huh? No, no
I couldn't matter fact it was freezing cold when I when they caught me too. So I couldn't the windows
I remember were frozen up so you couldn't even see out the windows all white. So I got to see nothing
That's that bites. Yeah. Yeah, you know
Hmm
So any more hot dates besides the Scientology girl
No, no nothing that um, no, not really
So you're on the up and up at least you're feeling better now. I mean, I'm starting you've kind of I'm starting
That's the depression. Well, I am because I'm starting to basically come to the conclusion that you know, like I was holding out that
The thing with Jess and I like was gonna work out like she's gonna figure it out. She screwed up
She's gonna come back. She's gonna apologize. I'm gonna give her some shit, but I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna be like look you gotta figure this out. We gotta work this out
But you know and I was gonna give her a hard time, but the bottom line is this I'm at the point now where I realize
That's probably not gonna happen. No, it's definitely not. Yeah happen Matt. So yeah, you need to move on right $2. Someone just sent me $2. That's great
You might not sell one painting on this podcast Matt I the last podcast made like five grand

She didn't know anybody she lives in Tampa
She's no great Cardone Grant Cardo's a Scientologist
We're talking about you period and Scientology what
No, we're not you're talking about Scientology, I'm not I'm I'm nothing you have an issue with Scientology
I have no issue with Scientology. So you would be a Scientologist. I mean if I believed in organized religion in any way
I mean, I'm not opposed to I mean the honest honestly the idea of
Dianetics isn't like it's a very it's all about bettering yourself
I like that I'm getting rid of all the negative resistance in your life all the negative influences in your life
I like that. It's a very yeah
I love it to let the general idea of Dianetics the problem is once you get once you get past that then you start getting all these crazy like
How clear are your your OT level and you start giving them all this info during the audit
The auditing sessions are weird when you hold those like you have to hold these metal rods and they interrogate you and they ask you
These questions I don't I mean, I don't know anything about that. It's kind of crazy, but you would you would try it though
I try anything pretty much. I mean with the exception. I think Scientology should get Matt Cox
I think he would be a great addition to the religion
What are you doing in the prison of belief, okay, so somebody just said I will buy
Hugh this guy Hugh. Have you seen the documentary? He said I'll buy he just said the documentary did what he he just said
Yeah, the prison of belief. It's an HBO special
Have you not watched it? No, bro, you need to watch it. It's a fucking amazing documentary. I
Think it's the same guy who did the Enron documentary the smartest guys in the room
That was a great documentary same guy. I think pretty sure. Okay, it's a it's honestly
It's one of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time. No, I've seen a lot, but that that HBO
Scientology one was fucking bonkers and I had that guy Mike Rinder and
Another guy John Sweeney on the show recently they both did lots of work on Scientology. What are you doing?
Should we end this thing now? Oh?
Sorry, go ahead. What's up? Nothing. I'm wondering am I offending you you're just sitting there
Fuck rolling on your phone. I mean, I'm barely listening to you. I barely this somebody sent me $3. That's great
So I I I barely you
Yes, I'm a he's now he's trying to talk to you now Alex Gibbon
Alex Gibney, that's what his name is. Yeah is the director now. He's he's talking to he should call in I mean you can call in
Yeah, have this guy call in tell this guy. What's his number? Let's go. Let's have him call in
Maybe he wants to talk Matt Cox doesn't want to listen to anybody. He just wants to hear himself talk. I'm listening to everything
What a fucking dick
Oh
So Jen says she's not watching by the way, she's like not allowed to watch
She's not not allowed. She's not allowed. I promise you they're talking about her in the chat. She doesn't have YouTube
She is she's not allowed to have YouTube. She's allowed to have you not okay. Hold on. Let me ask her ask her
Are you allowed to use the internet?
The real internet you want me to ask her yeah, I type it will be here all night. Yes, okay
Danny says you're not watching because you're not allowed to use
YouTube or the internet period. That's not true
comma
Right question mark because then she will find out the truth about Scientology
Like she hasn't already fucking look she's a she's a business person
I mean, she's like we're a lot of Scientologists are business persons to people so you think they don't hear anything
Fucking loaded they hear anything you're saying you're saying you're making an argument
Opposing our well first of all my argument is kind of
Like comedy. I'm kind of just I'm halfway joking. I'm halfway just like trying to push her buttons
But it is true to an extent that I know some people aren't allowed to do the research
Maybe maybe that's old. Maybe they don't maybe they don't do that anymore
But she she listen I've she seemed fine. She didn't seem crazy. No. No
You would join Scientology for her if she's like Matt Matt come
I'm a guy I pretty much do anything for this girl goes of course I do it. I'd fake it
I'd be Jewish. I'd become Jewish if it listen if you're a Muslim. I'm willing to let's let's start praying five times a day
I mean, let's do it. This girl. She look like tomorrow. That's what I need this lady right here
This lady goes tomorrow Matt Cox moving. She said not true. Give me your babies. You're me. Well, she said not true
I said the question was not true. Oh, well, I'm not believing until I go through her phone
You go through her phone. You're you're crazy. So all right
Okay, if what have your bait first of all I'm 51 years old. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's ridiculous
I'm not gonna hold it. She wants to spend the rest of her life with you
She wants to have five kids with you ten kids with you and she sounds more and more saying I live happier ever have happy
What does it say ever happily ever after?
And
But you have to join Scientology. I mean, yeah, why not? Sure. Let's do this. All right
I think you'd be a great addition to Scientology, honestly
You could be like the new John Travolta because they have they try to recruit celebrities to try to promote their celebrity
I'm like the anti celebrity. You kind of are a celebrity
No, I'm like infamous not a slim, you know, didn't you go to a Starbucks and some guy like bum rust you because you saw

Tolerates me. I mean, it's different when people recognize you. They're famous. I
Can't do this. Okay. So we what else are we doing? We're selling paintings. We're not one pain

What kind of art like what do you when you say I'm Matt Cox high? I want to get my degree in fine arts
Is there different categories of fine arts because your style is obviously very unique like me
Personally, I'm a fan of like the the abstract looking art that you can't really tell what the fuck's going on like uh
Pollock, what's his name?
Jackson Pollock, I love Jackson Pollock's work with the like paint splattered everywhere
You don't know what's going on
But it just you look at it and it just fucking grabs you by the throat because you just want to stare at it and it's
You can see whatever you want in it
But your style is more like comic book style or like lost surfboard style like back in the day lost surfboards
Pop art, which would be pop art. Yeah more reminiscent of uh, andy warhol
or uh
Roy lichtenstein lichtenstein
Yeah, so there's there, you know those uh

Him coming to a point where realizing that standing in honor is important to me is
That's really where everybody needs to achieve to be
That's some good advice. What's your name? What's your name man?
Brian Parker Brian Parker. Where are you from? Where you live?
Well, right now I live just south of Tampa down by Fort Myers
Originally from Michigan. Okay, but you know, it's looking at
Being deep in all this stuff when I first came to Florida
I moved to a great city
That was like that's where they were bringing all the drugs and stuff and people were kind of looking at me sideways
You know what I'm saying, you know, and so I figured out what was going on there
And it's amazing what's down here
And for living on the water
How old are you?
I am 51 now so I can kind of
I can sympathize with that a little bit
Although I'm five seven. So, I mean, I guess I'm a giant
You're a giant
God, he's fine with a good pair of shoes. Yeah. No, you know, I don't even need a good pair of shoes
But you know, no in my eyes with what he's gone through and where he's come to mentally, you know
Somebody from the church of Scientology. Good. God. You know
They're supposed to be ascending to a higher spiritual level
In my viewpoint Matt has already ascended to a much higher spiritual level than many of them
Because he's you can realize what things are really about he's learning about who he really is
Where he's really at and that's really what it's all supposed to be about
What do you mean? What do you mean when you say who he really is? Well explain that
Who he really is when I say that
It's because
We are birthed or born into this world with a misconception
And given a playbook that we're supposed to follow and it's never really about who we really are inside
You know what I'm saying
And so we have to come to a point in life where we sit back and go wait a second
Who am I really am I supposed to be following this little playbook? Is that really
What is laid out for me in my life even though I see everybody around me following the same script
And you kind of sit back and go okay, wait a minute
Who am I really?
Yeah, instead of being told who you are and what you have to do. You gotta decide that for yourself
Hell yeah, Matt. What do you think about that?
Sure, have you I have you were taking psychedelic mushrooms?
Yeah
I'm asking you I know matt hasn't
Uh, yeah, I I did try him a couple times the first time actually I
Started I tried acid
I just got now to hell. Yeah
I had been at the Marine Corps gone through most of boot camp and saw what it was all about said. Yeah, this ain't too cool
I'm leaving this shit. Yeah, I said, oh
We'll send you to lovin worth making little rocks out of big rocks. I said, okay, you've got my address
so anyway, I left
and
Before I got back to the house that night somebody said hey
So I said, okay, cool
I tried it nothing happened after 20 minutes. So I tried another hit
Yeah, so that was an interesting experience
But to me you don't need those things to really connect to who you really are where you're really from
I think it's really about the experiences you go through in life and things like that and you know what?
One of the things that I've noticed listening to matt listening to many other people
Is that these people that live the ordinary life you graduate
High school you go to college you start a family. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know what that's boring shit
Nothing ever happens there people that we can go out on the limits
And really try to accomplish things that are kind of fringe
That's where your amazing stories come from. That's where your amazing experiences come from and those are the things that really teach you about yourself
Hmm, I've said that many times that's profound. Hmm. What kind of weed are we smoking on tonight?
I don't know about profound, but I think it's definitely true
If you want to hang out you want to have dinner with somebody
You don't want to have a dinner with the guy that's an accountant
That he he graduated high school. He married his college sweetheart
They had three and a half kids or 2.5 kids
He got a job working at at IBM as in the accounting department and he teaches little league
He's a wonderful guy and god bless him. He's the backbone of america and we need middle class upper middle class people to run this country
But the truth is that's a guy that after dinner with him. You want to shoot yourself in the head now the guy that's had three duis
Right and been arrested a couple of times
And he would maybe a couple bangs, you know, that's the guy that you're like this guy's got some stories
He's pretty cool. Yeah, this guy, you know, I mean, I'm he's he's obviously he's
Maybe he's very Sullivan. Maybe he's not maybe maybe that's the guy
You go now this guy's been through some shit. He could tell me some stories
Well that first guy that you described that's the guy that I call the good slave. Yeah nice the good slave. Okay
Cool, man. Well, hey, thanks for calling man. I really appreciate your time. We enjoyed uh hearing your words of wisdom
and uh keep watching the show
Oh, absolutely. All right. I'll bounce back for you to be blessed. Have a great night. Appreciate it
The guy was cool. That guy was super cool. All right, Austin call somebody else. That was a good one, Austin
We got a good vibe going here tonight. Yeah
This painting is turning out great math got these crazy fucking ultraviolet rays shooting out of frank's head
Fuck this is good. I'm already tired. This is better than I thought
His hands are getting his hands are getting tired. He's got to raise some money here
This is horrible. No, this is good, man
We need to get uh
The person who suggested this
That guy they won't send a number. They want to email the number
Yeah, email to email to daniel at con Daniel at concrete.com. There you go. They probably don't want it in the chat, right?
That's fine. Here's somebody just threw 10 bucks and put their phone number and call them awesome
Yeah, yeah, call the guy who just donated 10 bucks
marson
Somebody donated 10 bucks said let's get on that jason painting. Oh, I know that's that
Oh, oh, I don't know that. I know who that is. He didn't give the number
He didn't give the number. I designed his jason painting
Really? Yeah, I already ordered it from you. Hello. Hey, what's going on, bro?
Hey, what's up guys? How you guys doing? Good man? How are you? What's your name? Where you from?
Man, my name is alex man. I'm originally from romania watching you guys
Wow, alex alex wants this for his girlfriend
She loves jason. Oh, really? I'm gonna show you my look
I'm even listen even showing you the jason thing
You're gonna give me a hard time about it, but it's my take on jason like a new modern looking kind of it when i'm done with it
It'll i'm gonna do it in magenta like that blood red kind of magenta with hot pink. That's murlow
It's not murlow. It's it's the tube says magenta
so
It's uh, it's a super i got a super cool take on the jason and it's gonna be cool
It's you're just not gonna think it's cool. What's your name again, man?
My name is alex bro. Hey, do you have any words of wisdom for us?
Uh, no, I just want to ask a matter question, man
Uh about the real estate if it doesn't mind answering, uh
The question is like, uh, what does he think the next bubble is gonna burst?
Is the market gonna fall or is it gonna keep on going up with the mortgages right now?
Because everybody everything is selling like crazy everybody's buying like crazy the rates are down
How long does he think this is gonna last or what does he predict for the future?
Is he gonna be crashing like in 2008 or is it going to be going down slowly or
What is what is the take on it?
Oh, I think it's gonna crash. I think it's gonna be 2008 all over again
I figure there's probably they could probably keep it propped up for another's what 12 months to 18 months maybe
But I mean how how long can you just keep pumping money into a system until it eventually
You know crash. So do you think it's going to be like 2008 or it's going to be worse?
Especially with this two trillion dollar bill that they passed with the inflation coming up
Do you think it's going to be worse than 2008 or it's going to be something like 2008?
I honestly it's just a gut feeling like I don't have the numbers
I I wouldn't even know how to begin to calculate those numbers, but I'd say I'd say within the realm
Of the finance of the 2008 financial crisis. I'd say it's about probably in the same
That same realm. I mean the bottom line is the government will bail it out and then it'll take
The problem is is this this time. It's not like they have anybody to blame
You know I'm saying like this time. It's like who do you blame for this?
You can't blame wall street. So they're basically going to blame this pandemic, right?
Basically because of the pandemic everything is going to be everybody's going to get paid bills out
But the difference is that you have to think about the the the TARP package where the TARP package was passed
They went and they they said we're going to give the banks the money. We're going to take stock in exchange
Well, keep in mind about 90 to 95 of the TARP funds have been paid back
Who's going to pay back the money if the entire economy crashes? They can't go to the banks
It's not the bank's fault. So it's just going to have to be inflation and inflation technically is just you're just
redistributing that
That loss among people so that means that basically a loaf of bread doesn't cost five dollars. It's costing 15 and 20 bucks
So people are hungry people aren't buying real estate. There's a crash people are being laid off. They don't work government has to come in
So I mean it could be the 2008 it could be worse
I I don't know. I'm not I'm not that guy. I'm not an actuary. I can't count Cal
You know crunch the numbers. I'm not that smart, but I think ultimately it does happen
You know, I think what to me I even did a video on my channel about this
Like to me what I would do every because guys ask me all the time
What would you do with real estate if you wanted to invest in real estate? What would you do?
What would you do? Okay? Well, what I do is because you don't know if it's going to happen in the next six months
Or it's going to happen in the next year what I would do is I'd buy many single families as I could and I turn them into rooming houses
I take the living room dining room and I turn it into a bedrooms
So I take a three bedroom two bath or three bedroom one bath and turn it into a five bedroom
Because the one thing that's going to happen is people are going to need to are cheap housing
You can put bunk beds in them. Listen when people get hungry things that they're saying right now
Oh, I'd never live in a rooming house really well when you're living on the street
You won't mind
bunking up with another guy in a room
As opposed to having to sleep on the curb
so the fact is is that
That's something you can buy right now
And it doesn't matter if you're buying at the top of the market because you're only buying them for cash flow
So it doesn't make a difference. It doesn't matter if you're up a hundred thousand dollars upside down
If your cash flow is a couple thousand dollars a month. What do I care if I'm upside down?
I could be upside down 12 million dollars if my cash flow at the end of the month
if my my positive
Is 20 grand a month
What do I care if I'm in debt or upside down 12 million as long as I can maintain it and walk away with 10 or 20 grand a month
That's what I do
So I would be buying everything every single every shithole single family I could buy right now
I'd buy it
Turn the living room dine room into a bedroom and I'd rent them out as rooming houses
Obviously, there's certain areas you can't do it. You can't do it in a pud
You can't do it in a in a deed restricted community and you have to look into it a little bit
But it doesn't matter you can buy houses that nobody wants to live in right now
Because guess what people that need to live someone somewhere will rent a room
People are renting rooms right now for 150 bucks
a month
So, I mean, I'm sorry 150 dollars a week
God damn they're renting rooms right now for 150 dollars a week easily
You can put you can put an ad on craigslist right now for a room for rent at 150
And within an hour you'll get 15 to 20 calls
Guys desperate to rent the room because the truth is look
If you're a 40 year old man and you're divorced with two kids
You have to pay your child support
You have to there are all these things you cannot cut what I can't cut food. I have to eat
I can't cut making my car payment or making my insurance or my health insurance or paying my my child support
What can I cut my living expenses? That's the only thing I can cut. So guess what? I want to see my kids
I want to pay my child support. I want to I want to be able to have health care
I want to be able to have my car so I can go see my kids. I want to do all these things that I can't cut
So I'm willing to shack up in a room
I'm willing to shack up in a bunk if you said, hey, I got a bunk bed you can rent in a room with three other guys
It's going to cost you a hundred dollars a week. You'd be shocked how many guys will say I'll take it and be thankful
They'll be thankful to pay a hundred dollars a week because they don't have a choice
What's that going to be like in a year and a half from now?
People will be desperate to get into those rooms
So that's your that's the only thing that's a for sure thing right now
But there's no way you cannot continually pump money into an economy and expect
That you're not going to have inflation and a crash
And there's all these economists out there. They'll say they'll say they'll all say it's coming and then there are other economists
They're saying, oh, no, it'll be fine. It'll be fine. Well, what the hell do you guys know? Anyway, everybody said everything was
You know peaches and cream in 2007
In 2008 it was like, oh my god, this is horrible. Why didn't we see this coming?
People never want to see what's that was what's right in front of them. They don't want to see what's bad
They always look on the bright side of
And hey matt one more question. What do you think what about deflation?
Do you think we're experiencing right now a deflation and the reason they're pumping money into it is to to
Prevent the deflation
There's too much stuff out there. So they need to the purchasing power deflation
or inflation
No, no deflation
I don't I don't know anything about I don't see any deflation. That's happening right this minute. What do you what do you mean?
What are you basing that on? I don't know what is deflation
It's when things are basically
No, basically deflation is when you don't have the purchasing power
You have too much stuff stored in warehouses and people don't have money to buy it
So that way people go out of business because they don't sell their product
So that's basically deflation, right? You know, okay, you have the product, but nobody has the money to buy it
So then everybody's going out of business no matter how cheap they try to sell it
Nobody's gonna have the power to buy it because there's no money into the economy
You feel like that's what's happening right now
I don't know. That's what I'm asking you. Do you think maybe that's the same idea or like uh
The reason they're pumping so much money into it or whatever or I don't know
I have no idea. I mean, I think they're pumping money into the economy
Just because they're trying to keep everybody going right now and everybody's bills being paid and
people, you know
Eating. I mean, I think that's what they're
Where does my question is where's all these trillions come from?
Obviously, it's just you know, the money is not obviously they I heard you know, I heard the other day
I heard more money has been printed in the last
Four years
Then in the entire history of the united states
I don't know. I don't know
But isn't that the causes the houses are going up because the money are
Evaluating so you got to pay more money for the same thing
You think the house is going up in value
But what's happening is the value of the dollar is going down
So you got to put up with more dollars to buy the same thing. You think oh my god, my house is half a million
I bought it with 300,000
But the but the inflation is so bad that you actually have to put up more money to buy the same thing
Isn't that the same concept over here? Well, I think I think that there's a lack of inventory
On the market right now as far as houses are concerned because the banks are obviously they're still lending money
And people are putting money into houses right now because they don't know what the future holds
But here's the the nice thing about buying a house if you buy a house for 200,000 dollars
Even if you're paying at top market, okay
Even if you're paying 40,000 dollars, then more than the house was worth a year ago
The fact is is you're buying a house with a fixed mortgage payment. So your payments $1,500 a month. So
whether the whether if there's inflation and let's say
Let's say even if it doesn't matter if there's a crash and it doesn't matter or and it doesn't matter if the prices keep going up
You've got a fixed rate. So you have you have a fixed payment from here on out
So people dump money into homes right now because they just don't know
What they're dot with the dollar is going to be worth in the future
But at least they'll have a home over their head with a fixed payment
So if the prices go up, they're good if they go down, they're still good
Because if you were to take a hundred thousand dollars
$100,000 might not be worth a hundred thousand dollars in two years from now or a year from now
But your house will your house payment will remain the same
I don't know if that makes sense. I probably didn't explain that very well, but they're getting into a house
Yeah, and they're bar and they're borrowing the money from the bank at at at almost nothing two three percent interest rates
And they're bar. Yeah, but let me let me ask you this
Let me ask you this one second. Let me drop to one second. You see that's the trick
That's something the trick is you see the value of the house is going up. The interest is going down
Everybody said oh my god. I'm making a good deal. The interest is low, but the house is high
But isn't the same formula if i'm buying a house at three hundred thousand dollars with five percent interest
Or i'm buying a house at half a million dollar house with a two percent interest isn't the same thing
But people think oh my god, i'm saving a lot of money, but i'm paying over the value of the house
But i got a little small interest rate. Isn't it the same?
I mean, it's similar. I I think that your your payment is fixed and so if the if
If prices keep going up at least your payment at least you're locked in at a at the same payment
And your money is invested in real estate
So your money should be secure
I mean, i'm i you know, i'm not sure exactly. I don't know if i'm answering the question right. I'm not sure if I
If i'm even capable of answering the question
After all matt's just a con man. Yeah, I don't know. I appreciate man. Listen
It's an honor to talk to you guys right now with max risk and it's a real honor, you know
Hey, man, and that's the reason yeah, do you want to buy any artwork from matt? No, he's trying to buy
Listen, i'm on the phone right now. So i cannot watch you guys on the screen
So i'm gonna have to probably hang up and i'll make if i don't buy it i promise i'll make a super channel nation over there for matt
Okay, all right, you got a deal
All right, man. Thanks. Thanks for another thank you guys. Thanks for calling and thanks for watching man. We appreciate you

You didn't like the jason thing. I thought it reminded me of nicky menage like sitting there with their ass hanging out
But but it was jason so it gave me a weird vibe
Bro, it's
No, bro, it's gonna be super cool. It's gonna be real dark dark dark like the whole thing
But why was he squatting? Why is everybody you draw like squatting? I'm just trying to get the whole
I'm trying to utilize the space as best as possible trying to get as much of the character in there
Okay, plus what I want to put in there is I want to put
I want to put something about jason being you know all about austin call up the next guy all about sland
Let me see what you got

Do you are you interested in any of matt's artwork? We're trying to pedal some of matt's art pays bills
Yeah, I mean I sent him an email a little earlier
I'd be willing to get like a custom piece done. I was wondering how much that would cost
Matt, I'll do it for you right now for $50
Right now it's a piece he's saying like a scribble matt just drew a portrait of frank amadeo on on a piece of uh
I think honestly. I think these are more genuine because he does them live
They're live on the podcast. Yeah
And he's don't agree with them. I don't agree with that. I don't know. I like it matt. I think that's cool
I fuck with that painting matt's like old school, you know, you know what it matt if you if you do something that's
Similar to that marilin
Montereau poster that you did but in a in a quick
You know quick time. I'll give you 50 bucks for it for sure right now
Oh my of what? What do you want? It's marilin marilin. He's saying marilin marilin send the 50. I got a bunch of marilin
Well matt'll do it right now live on the podcast and we'll sign it for you
All you gotta do is just pay pal and 50 not marilin. You know what make it a self-portrait matt
Yeah, with the perfect hairline. Yeah, hey, they're saying paint you
And like black and white down for that black and white self-portrait like marilin for 50
All right, he's doing it bro. He's literally walking over in luck to his stack of canvases right now
He's gonna do it. This is good. This is great
I
Had 600,000 in cash one time
In cash now you're sitting this dump with us. So matt's starting the painting right now brother
Danny's mother's basement, and I'm fine hoping to get somebody to send me 50 bucks
It's so sad
So do you have any uh, do you have any uh words of wisdom for matt? Do you have any advice for his uh, his love life?
Like for his love life. Yeah, we need help. Yeah, he matt's having some some issues right now
And his luck he just had a big breakup and he's uh, he's trying to find a new girlfriend
And he's having some issues because he's getting kicked off all the dating apps because he's a con con man
I'm a felon. He's a felon. Well, you know what? I sympathize with matt and I'm not a huge fan of the dating app
No, how are you? I don't find her. I don't I'm uh, I'm 30. Okay
All right
Yeah, I never used one of the dating apps
I find uh
In most cases they just end up in really shallow connections unless you get lucky right
But um
If you want like a deep long lasting relationship, I feel like the dating app is not really the place to be at
Matt think matt listen to this
I've been with my wife for 11 years. We met at a bar at the bar with him. Yeah
She says she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time
But you didn't you didn't meet with an app. Did you no, we just met at the bar. She walked up to me
No, but two-thirds of of two-thirds of marriages
Are from yeah, uh dating apps. Really? Yeah, maybe in like 2020
Looked the last five years
Yeah, recently. Yeah, no from 1960. Yeah, I mean I watched
I watched some of your recent videos matt
I think you you had just released one. Uh, is it today? I think I watched before you got here. Yeah, people were hounding me
Yeah, yeah, I watched that one and uh matt's depressed man. I don't know man
They just just just keep pushing you know what I mean like I watched a lot of your videos and I like the fact that
You're you're thinking of your time out of jail early as time that you could just use to do what you want
Right and just try to pursue your career changing and I think you know, I'm only 30
But I think that life is short and you got to do what you what you want to do
So I honestly I admire that like instead of just going to a nine to five and
Just going right back into the system. You're trying to do your own thing and build your own business and do what you actually love
I mean, that's honestly, that's amazing
I I that's it only took me I thought about that for about five years in prison
And that's what I came up with matt really took the bull by the horns
I mean when he when we did that first podcast with him he took that opportunity and ran with it
He's done so he's doing commercials now. He's been flown across different countries. He's doing netflix documentaries. I mean
It's me. It's incredible. I'm impressed with matt cox
Yeah, I owe it all to danny. That's what danny really is getting at
No, you don't know who wants me. He's told me. I'm just really impressed. Listen stop
He's being humbled many times we've been I've been begging him pay for a meal and he's like
Fine and then he's like, you know, you owe me like all this like everything that's gone right in your life is all
It's not because you put any effort into it all. It's all me. You know that I'm like, yes, danny
I thank you so much. Hey, by the way, I spent 20 bucks earlier with the super chat and that was uh, oh hell
Yeah, bro. See that and that was for matt. Do you hear him say that for that was for matt?
All right, I'll buy you dinner matt. Thank you. I appreciate I appreciate you, uh, you know
I understand this show is all about the guests and people love the guests
We got lights to keep on we got to keep the lights on here too, man to keep these uh people like matt coming in here for you guys to uh
You know love yeah for sure man. You guys got a great thing going every dollar helps
Yeah, it's my pleasure man. I love supporting, uh, you know channels that have content that's
More out there than what everybody else does. You know, I like that. You know, there are
But there aren't a lot of them. So sometimes I watch concrete
No, no, but you guys you guys have no filter. You know what I mean?
You're just like it's almost just like a couple of guys like hanging out and just doing whatever and it's actually pretty
Cool. Thanks, man. I appreciate that. Oh, yeah, how long have you been uh, how long have you been watching our stuff?
Um, not super long but I've watched everything that uh, that you've done with matt
Oh, awesome a few other things. Uh, like when you had that
Scientologist guy that was a really dope interview. Oh, yeah, which which one?
Um, I forget the guy's name. We've had a few Scientologist guys is why I ask but anyways
Yeah
Yeah, that one was amazing. Yeah, he was
Man, the guys story is crazy. You really get to see like how insane Scientology is
Yeah, man from the inside matt's dating a Scientologist right now
That's a lie. That's a lie. Yeah, I was hearing that before and she's a 10 and she's a 10
I mean, look if it works it works, but I just
I don't know man. The stuff the stuff that they do in there just seems like it's straight up brainwashing
It is it's really fucked up. It's a prison of belief is what it is
Yeah, I mean, especially when your leader is just going around like
You know yelling at people and you hear stories about him
Just like beating the shit out of people who just do things that he doesn't like, you know
Or yeah get on his wrong side like that's
That's kind of messed up, right? It's kind of the opposite
What like a religious leader is really supposed to do
Yeah, no, it's
It's wild man. It's wild. What's his name? David Miss Gavage
He beat the shit out of Mike Render a few times and Mike Render was his like number one
Uh executive in the church of Scientology and he kept him in this building with a bunch of other guys and like punch them and kick them on the
Who like push them on the ground and kick the shit out of them. Yeah, it's wild
But yeah, the guy basically has slaves. It's not followers. It's slaves man. It's crazy. It is crazy, man
Well, cool. Matt's working on this picture right now. It's looking really good. Um, he's just like the beginning faces of it
but uh
But yeah, we appreciate you uh commissioning matt for this piece of artwork
And uh, anything else you want to ask matt personally?
You
There
Yeah, yeah, sorry that the line just cut. Oh, no, no. Um, no matt's working on your piece right now
Yeah, you got a quick question for you matt. I mean
You know, you've been through a lot
And um, you know, you've gone to jail for a long time too. Like you've got a lot of time to kind of think shit through
I'm just wondering like what advice would you have for for someone my age who's much younger?
You know just to
Looking back at your life. Like what would you have done?
Obviously apart from the mortgage fraud and going to jail for 12 years
Like what would you do differently to kind of have a better life?
Like either mentally or just in terms of your your job or you know, your lifestyle
Stop don't look at me like I'm gonna say something profound because I'm not waiting for it
Because I mean honestly and this is like horrible
Because like all of my advice when people ask me this and people ask me this all the time
Believe it or not for some reason they think I'm inspiring which is something I've never gone for
Let me just give you a little bit words wisdom matt's matt's a false prophet first of all
Yeah, so basically all my only advice is the same advice any father gives anybody
And it's like the same shit your dad says it's like it's like, you know, I mean you work hard be patient
Don't try and keep up with the jones
You know, I mean it's it's it's I mean it doesn't the thing is is you know how many times you keep up with jones
You know how many times I and I and I find myself doing this danie's gonna mock me
But it only because he knows deep down it's true
But I mean I actually danie actually has a pretty good like danie
Could drive he could drive a super nice flashy car. He doesn't
You know what I'm saying like like I noticed that danie puts his money where it's where
Smart and not where it's flashy to let everybody know
Hey, look i'm a big shot and I find myself doing the same thing
Constantly where it's like I want to get a new nice car that I pull up in a really nice car
And I think what are you doing, bro?
You're gonna put money into a car that's going to depreciate like like I'm trying to reinvest into things that will make me money
I'm trying to not do things because it will impress other people
And that's the problem is that I think most people are trying to impress people that basically don't like them anyway
And they're not patient. They want things right away. They don't want to work for it. They don't want to save they
And and just in my opinion that that's like a huge downfall is like I have to get the bigger house
I have to have the better car. I have to have why
What does it matter? I mean, why do you want to get something that you can afford?
Save your money. Be smart. Be humble. Be appreciative
The life is so fucking good out here and people have no clue how good they have it
You could be a jew in
1938
Germany you could be an african america african american in the 18th century
In new Orleans, you know, you could be there are so many horrible horrible situations
You could have been born into and the truth is life is amazing here and people just don't appreciate it
And I mean that to me but to me that's like that's not words of wisdom
That's just the same thing that your dad would tell you so I don't think
I don't think that that's profound. I think that that's just something something that I didn't believe
It's like, you know what it reminds me. It's like it's like money can't buy happiness, you know, but
Everybody wants to find out for themselves
So, you know, it's like but I've had money and I was never happy
I was never really happy and I didn't even realize how miserable I was
Outside free with tons of money until I had nothing and I was laying in a in a bed in prison
Where I realized how unhappy was I was I was super happy in prison
Writing happier in prison writing than I am right now
Because I'm now having to struggle to make bills to do this and I not really don't have the time
To write like I want to write
So it it doesn't make sense
But the truth is is if you gave me a million dollars
The only thing that million dollars would do was they'd give me time to start writing which is something I like to do
That's all the million dollars would do. It wouldn't change me. It wouldn't make me happy. It just give me a little bit more freedom
That's all it would do
That was that was moving. I'm touched. So I told you you'd mock me. He's some people. I just can't help themselves
Yeah, that's honestly that's uh, that's amazing advice. So basically just
You know do what you want to do and don't really care what other people think
Yeah, I mean think about it like this too. I mean you don't get sucked up into all the fake
Bullshit on youtube and all the ads you want to make more money on amazon
I make a hundred grand a day on amazon follow me at grant cardone.com and join my pyramid scheme
I mean all that shit's so fucking
Whack, bro. Yeah, yeah, man. There's way too much of that shit is crazy
Like everybody wants to get rich quick and not do anything everybody wants to be a guru
Everyone thinks they have the answers and they want to sell you a course
Yeah, just do what you want
No, I mean do do what makes you happy. I mean do what makes you happy and don't focus so much on making money
Because ultimately making money is not going to make you happy do it what you want
You know do it what makes you happy and the money will come
I mean in the end if you're good at something if you're the best at something you're gonna make money at it
But don't take a job because it it pays a bunch of money
Don't do something just for the money
I would find something that you love to do and do that and stop worrying about keeping up
Most people take jobs because they can they want money to buy shit to impress people that fucking hate them
They don't like you anyway
Everybody that I made that I stole all this money
And bought a bunch of stuff to impress a bunch of people and when I went to jail
Nobody was there
You know who was there my mother
It is nice though living in a nice house like when you have like a nice a nice house with a pool and like
Big space and a big yard. I mean it's better. It's better a cat. It's better than living in a 500 square foot apartment
I will tell you that
But don't get don't put the car
What's it called the cart in front of the horse
Yeah, yeah, I'll put the cart before the don't do that. Take your time. You got time
Oh, how did you?
I'm 30. Oh, bro. You can make three or four bad decisions and still come out on top. Yeah
It's funny because your advice really kind of
Hits me pretty hard because that
Right now I have a job that I I do like
But you know, it's a regular job, you know, it's like a nine to five and I mean it does pay
It does pay really well, but I'm at a point where
Like I get really bad tendonitis, right?
and
Like really bad when I work and I'm at the point where I'm just trying to decide whether I should quit my job and just
focus on my health
And just do something else that I like. What's the job if you don't mind me asking?
I'm a financial planner
Tendonitis
Yeah, he's typing all yeah. Oh their hands
Yeah, I've had really bad tendonitis over the years and it's kind of gone up, you know in my neck and in my back
And anyways, it affects my quality of life a lot just to be at a computer all day working
So I'm at a point now where I'm trying to decide, you know, do I keep this job
For the money or do I just do something else and you know, try to do something where I can actually feel good physically
Oh, yeah, the advice kind of hits me pretty hard. Thanks for that. I think it applies. Absolutely. Yeah
Yeah, you can't you can't you can't have that painting coming. It's coming good. Give us. Yeah, give him a sneak peek of what it looks like

You know what to do and also I got a little bit of financial advice
For your for your for your for your subscribers. All right, let's hear it
Get out of crypto get out. What what do you mean? It's just it's almost hitting 60k
It's a crypto is gonna fucking tank and people are gonna lose
Everything it's gonna be like 1929, but it's gonna be why what what wait. Why are you saying this?
It's a bubble man. Danny doesn't want to hear it. It's a bubble. The bubble's gonna pop
It's all the price of bitcoin is artificially inflated
by who elon
Is the price well, I mean, you know, yeah, elon likes to watch elon likes to play with markets
And watch it go up and down every time he makes a fucking tweet or or or you make you don't make the loop
But what people don't realize is, you know, bitcoin is
Tied to the american dollar
The price of bitcoin is is based in us dollars. Is it not am I just misunderstanding this whole thing?
I mean, yeah, I mean, obviously there's a there's a dollar a us a dollar amount attached to it, but
What are you saying? How is it attached? How is it attached to us dollars explain that?
US dollar tanks which it's going to I mean just ask peter schiff and watch anything that peter schiff has to say
It's when the america when the when the dollar tank
And when there's hyperinflation uh going on in the country bitcoin is going to be fucking worthless
Hmm
What do you think what do you think about game stops game stop gme?
We're up right now, baby
Oh, man, I know I know it's a yo-yo. It's a yo-yo game. Stop. It's it's it's fun to watch
Yeah, it is fun to watch it
So should we buy it or sell should we buy or sell game stop right now by the dip? You know what buy game stop
You know game stop to the moon right now to the moon
Game stop to the moon. I'm all I am on the game stop train, man. Are you really how much money have you spent on game stop?
Uh, I'm about 1100 in at this point 11
Yeah
Yeah, really you think it's gonna keep going up
Also, you know, so it's gonna keep going up in you know real estate real estate market getting ready to take a shit
Just as Matt was talking about earlier
And you know, I think the only you know real tangible thing right now to be in is is buy gold buy silver buy gold
No, I think buy real estate too though
I mean if you if you're looking to buy land, I mean I would I would invest into into you know
Go buy 10 000 acres or something, but I think the
The real estate market is it's the one thing the government can't print more of
True, I mean I would wait here scoffing at me right now
I would wait a year before I jump in the real estate market
So I think the next 12 to 12 to 13 months are going to be extremely valuable. Yeah
We have to look at interest rates. I mean we're at zero right now. They're going up interest rates are going up
They just went up yesterday
Which are 2%
I don't know this went up a little bit yesterday. I don't know what the exact number is
But they went up. I heard they went up, you know, I mean listen, you know
The deep we're borrowing all this money from the fed the fed just keeps, you know, cutting tracks to the government and then we just keep
You know living off the backs of our children and our children's children
I mean, what's the national debt right now? I mean, how many fucking trillions of dollars is it in so many trillions
And county is listen, there's so many bubbles right now
The safest place if you're gonna if you're gonna invest in anything in my opinion, it's it's it's gonna be uh,
It's gonna be gold. It's gonna be silver and gold
I think crypto I think I think crypto I think the crypto is not ruining a lot of people
But what do I know? What about light coin? What about light coin?
I don't know man, I think I I'm just not a firm
believer in crypto like I just don't
Like I understand the technology behind it and I understand the hype around it
But I think it's gonna be I don't know. I just it's not it's not tangible. Yeah, like you can't hold it
You know what I mean like and then we I can't take bitcoin to the public and buy groceries
I can't take bitcoin to the to the mobile and put gas in my car. You can buy a Tesla with bitcoin
It has to be exchanged for dollars
And we and we know the you know what get 2 inflation a year the feds say I think it's more like five or six percent a year
Bro, do you know how much bitcoin the federal government confiscated from ross ulbricht?
Sixty nine hundred million dollars 60
It was 69 000 bitcoins
What is the math can you do the math for me real quick 69 000 bitcoins?
Bitcoin what is bitcoin at right now like like 57 000 or something
So like 57 000 times 69 000
It's something like three billion
Yeah, it's like 3.9 billion. It's insane

That's what we look at it. Yeah, happy to hear that. Who are you? What's your name and where are you from?
So
I'm deja and I'm from the US virgin islands. Have any of you ever been there?
Oh, I actually have been to the us virgin islands your name's deja
Yeah, deja just like deja vu. Wow interesting. That's a good strip club here
Yeah, so for the person who has been the virgin island. How was that like? Did you enjoy the beaches?
Yeah, I love the virgin islands. I was actually there. I was actually in the virgin islands for a bill fishing tournament
It was for a marlin fishing tournament
And uh, I stayed on some guys boat and we were like right we were in one of the marinas there in um
St. Thomas, I believe it was
Yeah, st. Thomas. Yeah, we were in st. Thomas. So we did we did a little bit of diving
We did a little bit of fishing and a lot of drinking
And uh, it's kind of my memory is kind of blurry honestly
It sounds like you did a lot of drinking. Yeah, we did quite a bit of drinking
um, so uh,
so uh, so
What what makes you call in to uh talk to matt cox today?
So, um, I called in because I actually got a call and I just wanted to know if you had
Any advice on how to make a little extra catch right now
Haha, yeah, we could think of a lot of ways. Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, deja deja deja deja deja
Would you be willing to uh, come to florida and go on a date with matt cox?
I will pay I will pay for your plane ticket
Wow, so I'm willing to come to florida and spend time with you all
What type of date because I am not single. I'm currently taken
Matt's looking for uh, you know matt's looking for a single single woman
Uh, then that wouldn't be me, but I'm sure he's gonna find a really great person. Do you have first?
Let me ask you this
Do you have any did you hear any of matt's talking about his love life and his recent breakup and all the all the
Online dating apps he's been striking out on
I haven't but um, if you give me a quick rundown that'd be great
The quick rundown is matt's matt's girlfriend of almost two years just broke up with him
A little over a year a little over a year. She just broke up with him
She said basically she loves him. She loves spending time with him or whatever
But she's afraid of committing to him long term because matt wants like a long term relationship
He wants to get settled down have you know, maybe have kids
Blah blah blah blah this girl's never said that matt's fifth kids. We stop not bad living matt's 51. She's
34
And uh, she broke up with him
But she still wants to like talked him and text him and hang out with him and be friends, but she doesn't want to like
Tie the knot with him. She just wants to keep doing what she's doing
While she's in school
Blah blah blah blah. She still wants to hang out with him, but she doesn't want to like
Be with him and commit to like a long term thing with him
She wants no commitment. So all the fun, but no commitment
Exactly. So so matt's on all the dating apps and he can't find a girl to
To take him seriously not take him seriously, but he can't find a girl to you're making it not desperate
I also haven't looked extremely hard. I've been kicked off several dating habit habits apps
because I'm a felon and
And I haven't really made an attempt being you know that much of an attempt, but I'm going to it's been a month
I'm fragile. He's fragile. Stop
Let me tell you how it really is deja. Okay, so he's been on a couple dates blind dates on these
Dating apps or whatever and the girls are like, oh, we have great chemistry
You know, I love talking to you or whatever, but but we're just going to be friends
Because whatever because he's too he thinks it's because either a it's because he's a felon x x con
Or b he thinks he's too short
Is he too short to pick up when he thinks it's something
Like physical like oh, he's too short
Or it's because it's he's I don't I don't think it's because of the
I don't honestly I think I doubt it's because of the
Prison sentence because of the x felon because a lot of people are x felons
It's because you did a couple of years in prison for for a fraud. That's not that big of a deal
But how tall are you matt you're five
I'm five six. He's five six. How tall is your boyfriend?
That's funny
deja
Oh, yeah, um, my boyfriend. He's six three
He's a goddamn giant hang up on her don't hang up on her do now
Well, I'm pretty tall myself. So it kind of makes me feel a little shorter. I'm five seven. I'll tell you how tall you she's five seven
I'm about five eight. Yeah hang up on her
Get a round out. Do not hang up on deja
How long have you lived in the virgin islands for?
Um, I say my entire childhood. So until I was 18 um and then I left
Where'd you go?
uh to
pa for college
So I
wanted to pursue engineering specifically chemical engineering and
Didn't quite have the focus and the level of research that I wanted to do back home. So I figured you know time to travel
Okay, what what college in pennsylvania?
Villanova
Are you a are you a really good at basketball? Are you a fan of the pittsburgh stealers?
I
Am I spent some time in pittsburgh and I have family in pittsburgh. So um, yeah, I was lacking yellow all the way
Hell yeah, oh, yeah, we're coming to the virgin islands to party with deja. You know, I beat juju smith sister in the game of madden
Did you what smoked his ass
Proof it sounds pretty intense. It's on one of the videos on the channel
So anyways, all right, go ahead. I asked your whatever question you have for matt cox shoot
Yes, she does. Um matt, it sounds like you're a really great guy
Someone that's really fun to be around and you know
This person that you're seeing they're lost that they don't want that commitment
sometimes
people are afraid of holding on to a good thing as where does that sound and
Um, I know online dating can probably be really tough
I personally met my boyfriend through online dating
So if it's a testament that it can work it, you know, take me for example
But I I would say
You know really try to find someone that you can communicate well with someone that you can have a lot of fun with and play with and
um
once you once you find that person then
Uh, those conversations of whether this is something short term or long term
Maybe you can have earlier on and
Um, and really all the best
Deja, do you think do you think his ex-girlfriend's thinking like, uh
She's thinking like bird in the hand versus two in the bush type thing
Can you say that again if she's thinking
Is she like have the mentality like a bird in the hand is worth
Is is not worth two in the bush like she's thinking that maybe there's one out there better
She can find so she doesn't want to she doesn't want to tie the knot with matt
Yeah
Yeah, that's what I was thinking too
I think I think exact that's well said, you know, um
It's better to kind of have you around and have someone to chat with but not have that commitment
Right, right, right. She wants what do you think she's really looking for? What do you think her mindset is?
I think she she wants her cake and she wants to eat it too and that's not really fair to matt. It's not so not fair. Um
That studying boundaries and kind of saying, you know, this is what I define for a long-term relationship
If you want that great, if not, then I can't give you what she wants to
She wants to maintain her
Her emotional connection and her her great relationship. She has with matt at the same time
She's going to college and she wants to scout as much young dick as she possibly can while she's still in college
She likes women too and she used to have a girlfriend, which is crazy. Yeah, let's not do that
That'll that'll just piss me off. No, we're gonna we don't want to piss matt off
I I think she really needs to understand what she wants and um
She definitely wants more she wants her cake and wants it too and you know, maybe
Just separating and having some time apart. Yeah
Well deja, thank you so much. I appreciate your insight. Um, I'm so glad we had a girl
Thank you for having me. It's so rare that we have a girl. Do you have any, uh, questions for matt that he can help you with?
Um, yeah, I so matt you said that you're an ex-convict and I think that
You're just going through that process. You'd have a lot of insight and what what do you think is the biggest thing that you've
gained or biggest change in perspective? Um
over the last couple years
I know it's a really big question. I don't understand the question
What what's the biggest? I think she's what what she's asking you is, uh
What was the biggest thing you learned from your time before prison in prison and after prison?
What was your biggest takeaway as far as perspective goes?
And uh as far as as far as your like your outlook on life
Mom, it's uh, it's the same thing. It's a it's a it's a
A dad answer. It's money can't buy happiness and talking to the mic matt. It's money can't buy happiness
It's the same thing you already know. It's money camp. There's no I have no wisdom
It's money can't buy happiness and find something you like to do and do that thing and
Stop trying to keep it. This is the same same thing that your father would tell you. What do you do for a living deja?
Um, I make candy for a living. So I'm a chemical engineer at a candy company
I won't sew a company, but um, that's that's what I do
So you can think of me as a little onca engineer. What kind of what kind of candy? What's what do you put in that candy?
Virgin Islands finest
Um, I think that's a little oh, yeah the secrets of the virgin islands. Please sprinkle in tropical paradise
Wow and breathe of sunshine
You're a chemical engineer. Thank you for sharing your perspective matt
Wait, wait, wait. I want to hear more about this candy stuff

Hey, somebody david l donated 50 bucks that I want matt to tell me in detail about the loans he got from pinnacle bank
Pinnacle bank 50 bucks pinnacle bank. Yeah, this guy this guy this guy knows this guy knows something
Oh, shit. I've never heard you talk about pinnacle bank pinnacle bank. Oh
Yeah, I don't remember hearing about this guy. I know about this so much fraud through pinnacle bank and and and specifically
Specifically Amy Amy early. Amy early was the account executive. Oh
Now married going by a different name, but she's she is uh following me on uh, facebook
Um, so I see her her every once in a while. I see so she sees your stuff. She sees my stuff. You think it's her
Oh, I know it's her. Oh, it's her
Um, but yeah, she uh, oh
We we did a ton of fraud it on pinnacle bank. Oh, yeah, how much fraud that like what do you think?
Million two million. Oh, we don't milk 10 10 million 15 million
In fraud and just pinnacle bank. That's what I'm talking about pinnacle bank. It was pinnacle bank corp and it was owned by pinnacle
He's owned by a guy named
Gary Vaughn
I remember it because it was it sounded it was very close sound bond
Vaughn and I used to joke all the time vaughn
Gary vaughn
so, uh
Yeah, man. Listen, they caught us
On over and over again committing fraud too really left and right
Gary caught us one time one time we got caught with like it was like
There's a couple several million dollars and they'd already sold a few million dollars to household bank
And then they caught us with like a million dollars in fraud
And they sold it. They knew it was fraud and they sold it to household bank again another one
What that was like the interesting they they called up
He was a little threatening when he realized that I was like look
I can't cut you a check for for the money that you thought you caught
So I don't know what you would if you're expecting I'm gonna cut you a check for like a million dollars
You're you're wrong. That's not gonna happen. Yeah, and he was like no, but you know
We're gonna go ahead and put this in a package that we're selling
So if it comes back on us though, we you have to agree
You'll help me get rid of any loans that come back on us. Of course
Of course. Sure. What am I gonna say? Yeah. No. Oh, yeah. No. No, you're here. Call the FBI. Fuck you
Of course, I'm gonna of course Gary. You can rely on me. Of course. I'm trustworthy and Amy would always run interference
She was always she'd call you up and be like listen. This is what they just found out. This is what they know
I don't know what you're gonna say, but this is what they know and I'd be like, okay
And then the phone ring like five minutes later the phone ring. Boom. I'd be like, yeah, what's and I'd have a
I'd already have a story completely ready
What? Oh, absolutely. Like if I didn't know beforehand, you don't know what to say. You're fucked. Yeah
You had to drop they asked did she go to prison too? Amy? No. No
She got enough when pinnacle eventually went under. I like to think by no fault of mine
um
I don't know that's true though. I'm sure you were a part of that when they eventually went under she just got a job working for
Citibank, you know, see a group Citibank. Yeah. Oh, yeah reputable bank
Um
And uh, yeah, she went to work for them. There was a chick that worked there named Nash. What was her name?
And we all went to dinner a few times. Anyway, yeah, uh, but in detail my god, bro
We had canceled checks. We had fake pay stubs fake
I mean that just there was so much fraud that we put through and we knew all the underwriters
They would come down. They'd take us to like they literally when they after gary caught us with a couple million dollars in fraud
A week later, he flew down and took me and three of the brokers out to uh, uh, out the dinner
And said what he spit? He actually said during that meeting he got drunk and he actually said
um
Oh, I was just thinking of something I can't even say say it. No, I can't say it was it's not it's not amy. Anyway, um
Because I always liked amy. I was kind of had a crush on amy. You did. Yeah, maybe she's available now. Yeah, she's not she's not
Okay, she's married
uh, that's I um, so
Gary got drunk and I remember gary. We were talking about fraud and gary said
To be honest, he goes, I don't care how much fraud goes through that company
He goes as long as it doesn't come back on us
He goes as long as it goes through our underwriting department and they don't catch it
He goes and it doesn't come back on us. He is that if it does go into foreclosure
He goes, I don't care how much fraud goes through that place. He's we know fraud's going through the place
He told me one time he caught a guy with fraud
He caught a guy with like a $250,000 fraud like literally they'd funded the loan
And like when they went to go sell it to their secondary investor
The secondary investor caught the it was fraud like and it was blatant
It was like w2's pay stubs like the phone number that verified the um the comp that verified the guy's employment
Like literally like went to the owner of the company. I mean so he called him up. He's like, oh, I had him
He was done. I told him I was going to call the FBI this and that
Gary said look we have to pay x amount of dollars to maintain
That loan until we can sell it now you're saying now we can't sell it
So it's stuck on our books and we have to pay a fee the longer it stays on there
Here's what the fee is so he said he came up with some ridiculous fucking like five or six thousand dollars
He was this guy had paid this like five thousand dollars a month for like four or five months
And really the money was just going into Gary's just taking five grand and his five grand five grand
And he said I don't care if he pays that fee forever
He said eventually he said the guy was paying it till eventually the guy got they sold the house or refinanced the house
He said oh, he's up to like 20 20 25 thousand dollars at this point. He was laughing about it. I mean he was drunk
And we were like, I was thinking this guy is fuck vicious
I was like
Wow, he's extorting. I mean his company went under. Yeah, I'm sure he turned around and opened up another. What was his name?
Gary Vaughn Gary Vaughn Gary somebody in the chat

Pretty sure the first podcast we did it with the first art auction matt sold like at least 4 000 dollars for the paintings
Keep saying wasn't that much
Yeah, that's it. I sold uh got uh one paint. Oh never mind he refunded it
No, we funded it got more. I got another painting was obviously somebody else sent
Um
Somebody else sent 300 bucks. Wow, who? Hugh. Hugh sent 300 bucks. Hugh. What?

Hello
Hey, what's up bro? How you doing?
I'm good. How are you guys good man? Who's this?
Um, this is Isaiah from texas Isaiah from texas. Isaiah Mullins
No, no, okay
How you doing man? You've been watching the stream
Yeah, I've been watching for
I think a year now at least I kind of listened to matt cox's podcast. Hell. Yeah on the way to work and
Yeah, hell. Yeah, man. Do you got do you got any?
Uh
Advice any words of wisdom for matt cox and his current uh situation in his love life
Um, I don't I'm I'm 18. Oh, I'm only 18. So I don't have any
Words of wisdom in that sense, but I did have a question for him. Go ahead. Um
So matt, do you have any
experience with crypto nfts
No, you know it does matt cox even know what nfts are
I have no I non fungible
Yeah, um, I think he should actually
Look into that with his art. I think that could be something pretty lucrative
Oh, I've I've had probably four probably three digital. I've had like three guys
Ask me to do paintings
With bitcoin like of bitcoin type, you know, no nfts are completely different. Okay. I don't know nfts are like
Digital baseball cards
I have no idea what that is. Yeah, so you could you could make a painting and
tokenize it and say what you could do 10
You could mint 10 of them meaning you could create 10 of them as a
maximum supply and do drops on your channel or whatever and
People can transact them and you'll even have a 10 percent royalty
For every time someone buys and sells it after that
Bro i'm telling you nfts are the next big thing. It's uh, yeah, they are everyone
It's just make believe it is make believe it totally is everyone's talking about it right now
It's like all the hype people are making a lot of money
nfts, bro
Yeah, like a video clip like a video clip of like a like a sports highlight of like lebron doing a fucking reverse dunk or
Something you do understand. I can barely use my iphone, right?
Yeah, they can do gifts and no idea. Like I I don't know half the functions on instagram
I just figured out so what's your name again, bro?
Isiah, would you be willing to like give matt
A crash course on nfts and explain to him how he can do this with his paintings
Yeah, sure
I've been doing I've been doing all kinds of crypto stuff for like three years
And also that I forgot his name, but whoever else came in on on the phone
And was saying stuff about how to get out of crypto boziak. Um, yeah
I could tell that didn't really fit right with you either. Do you have anything to say about it?
I don't know fucking shit about it. All I know is he's got money in it. I have I own some bitcoin
And uh, I know the price is like going through there. I wish I would have bought more when it went down to like the low 40s
a couple weeks ago
Um, but uh a close friend of mine who's actually really big into bitcoin and he he does a lot of uh
He runs a lot of like meetups in Atlanta
With uh, he's he's really versed in bitcoin. He he's telling me to buy litecoin right now
Yeah, it's extremely undervalued. Um
But just crypto in general all the things the other dude was saying
He was basically stating things that were actually the opposite of what his conclusion was
So him saying
All the inflation that's going on with the u.s. Dollar. That's actually good for bitcoin
um
When this next round of stimulus comes out you will actually see an increase in the price of bitcoin because
that money that
They are inflating our circulation with is
Encouraging investors to put their money in something that isn't losing value
Something like bitcoin or gold or silver or real estate that same analysis. He was saying actually applies to the opposite conclusion
Wait, he was basically he was saying bitcoin is tied to the u.s. Dollar
He was saying that when the when that when the economy crashes inevitably in the next year or so
He's saying that bitcoin will also crash
Um, yeah bitcoin it is in a bubble, but it is not
It is still gonna grow for probably till the end of this year. I'm saying
Somewhere between 200 and 400k. That's where it'll pop up
god damn
200 and until then 200k somewhere between 200 and 400,000 is probably where it will pop out. Wow
It's only at like it's 60. It's like right around like it's almost 50 60,000 now, right?
Yeah, yeah, um
Actually, even the next month it'll probably hit somewhere between 70k something like that
Wow
But yeah, like coins are good investment as well. Yeah, like coins are really undervalued
Um, yeah, not necessarily the price but the ratio between its last all-time high and now
It's pretty undervalued. Okay
How much money do you have in uh cryptocurrency?
Um, like I said, I'm only 18. I started it like a few years ago. I've probably made
Uh somewhere between 200k and 300k
Wow, man. Jesus. That's a shitload of money. Yeah
Yeah, I'm basically day trader as well. So you're a day trader as well
Yeah, what do you think about a game stop?
Um
Well about what happened already or no, what's going like the future the future
I mean, I don't really I don't
Like the whole thing with dogecoin and game stop and all the the short squeeze and whatnot
I basically stay as far away from as possible because I mean what goes up that quick has to come down
And I mean that's exactly what happened. But in in the future. I'm sure
I don't know like it's not really my
My
Zone I'm not with the hype trains. I like to pick on things that are
neglected or are really
I don't know undervalued. Yeah, so I I don't really know what happened. What should we buy right now?
Um, hold on let me give you something
In terms of crypto crypto or or any kind of stocks
Uh, what broker do you guys use?
I don't I don't invest I don't I don't invest. Yeah, fidelity. There you go. I don't danger. I don't you only got like three options
I don't pick stocks, but
Shane does
You guys have coin base or anything? Yeah, I have uh, I have a
Coin base and I have another wallet another crypto wallet. I figure what it's called
Okay
Um coin base, you got a decent selection. I'd say
Well, what time frame are you talking short term? I can give you something that's in the next month. You'll double your money. What's that?
Um
There's something called oxt
Which is a a privacy coin to vpn service crypto
Oh, no Edward Snowden
Yeah, it's on coin base. Yeah. Um, I think sometime this month, maybe in 10 15 days. They're having uh
An event and actually seen it and that's oxt as it's
one of its top five
innovations and like on par with like the covid vaccine and like the apple m1 chip all these things like
It's a pretty it's a really low market cap undervalued and
I've got a big pretty big bag in it. What's in it? What's what's it cost right now?
Sorry, what what's it costing right now?
Um, I think it's 61 cents right now. Oh, let's go

ideas for max
All right max before you give us the business ideas
We want some relationship advice for matt cox
Why not I mean
How's your love life max
Not very good. Not very good
No, I'm I'm I'm with you
How come so many of our how much how come so much of our audience is from the uk
Is it because of shawn atwood is that why?
No
I got into watching your show through watching
Your interviews with matt
I like listening to the two crime stories. I think that's fascinating the true crime is good. Everybody loves some true crime, don't they?
Yeah
Do you want to hear these business ideas? Yeah, hit us with the business ideas. Let's go
The first one is
Uh, you start selling some really cheap wallet
To have your signature employees has done the fact that the fake
Uh social security card goes all of them on the inside and you market them as matt cox's prison wallet
Yes, yeah
I like this
You know max i'm gonna make those and i'll give matt a cut of them profits, you know in prison
Guys they have a in colman. They have leather shop, right?
So it's you can buy leather and make you can make purses and wallets
So you could actually have inmates make the wall. They're actually a prison wallet
They're technically they're not allowed to sell wallets like they they give them. Oh, I made this for my sister
And they mail it to their sister and then they but but they'll make they'll make
Super nice wallets and they'll embroider embroider. What is it embroider them and everything? Yeah, so you could you could have the inmates make the wallets
That's cool as hell and sell them
But gary sullivan. Yeah, that'd be so awesome. What's the next one matt?
The other idea the other idea right just following on from the uh
Frank amadeo was thinking smalls like it is that you record
Frank rambling
And then you put them to music and release them as well as spoken word album
So his message can reach the masses easier
I you know, I mean, I like that but I you know, I actually tried to get him
I tried to get him to write a book called
uh, what is it um
Capital genesis, which is his business or his how to take over the world idea. Like I was like, right
Right, I asked him to write a book
Like like right. Let's write this down. Let's actually make you could be a hundred pages. You could sell that book
And he just he can't vote. He couldn't focus long enough to actually get it done and he he writes like
It's just it's just over the top. It's just over the top like he couldn't do it
And I was trying I couldn't talk to him directly
I was working between me and somebody else trying to get messages and it just became a nightmare
But I hear you. I mean, it's a funny idea. It's just
Until I actually get permission to actually talk to him
He's not in prison anymore. Is he no, he's he's out of the rest. He's on house arrest
He shouldn't have been in prison in the first place
He shouldn't have been in prison in the first place. Well, well, that's that's debatable here max
What the I think the difference is is that like in the uk like if you're mentally ill
They'll send you to an actual to like a hospital here. They don't give a shit here. They just send you to prison
Matt, he didn't pay like 300 million in taxes or something crazy. No, he didn't
He what are you talking about? He basically stole 180 million
You gotta do what you gotta do. I wish that was uh, you know, you gotta do what you gotta fucking do
Have you had any success in uh
And in Frank's stories for like a film or whatever
Oh, yeah, uh, man's got all sorts of stories for fans. I helped you imagine like a Frank Hamato like
Uh, a thriller mini series
Oh, sweet. Listen, you know, how late you realize you could get you could get
Five to ten years out of his story. Think about it. Think about how many times he's he's trying to
He's trying to get close. Yeah, it gets close but puts together a coup and it almost happens
And he puts together another coup and it almost happens
The cia is trying to stop him from doing that and they're trying to get him to do this and the
NSA comes in and the I mean that the politics involved
I mean you could drag that fucker out forever
It would be ten seasons it and he's and he's he's
Oh, you didn't read the book but bro. Listen, do you understand that he he actually went to a meeting
In a Darth Vader mask like went to a board room meeting walks in
You gotta read the book bro. You gotta get the book matter of fact, it's on I gotta um, it's on audible too
So he actually I mean and and when I heard that story
I thought that's insane that that could never then I read the transcripts when he was being sentenced
And one of the boardroom members got on the stand and actually talks about how he came in sat down and
Um, conducted the meeting while wearing a Darth Vader hat and nobody said anything. That's so fucking amazing
Just sitting there during the greatest thing I've ever heard
What's going on? Yeah
He's a god
Is a number
I can't what what'd you say?
I can't tell what
Someone has uploaded what?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, those have been out for a long time. Those are actually depositions is a mock deposition. Yeah
