We're rolling Michael Corey what is happening my mom calls me Michael come
on your mom and me that's it what's going on dude you got the sickest YouTube
channel I've ever seen it is it is so brutal the things that you do brutal
that's an interesting choice explain brutal is the word that I think best
describes your video going out into the jungle in Tanzania I think it was and
hunting baboons with those dudes with with aero poisons and your barefoot and
you're they're biting the necks of deer to kill them that is like pure
brutality to me yeah well you miss the part where when the dogs get cut they
actually urinate into the cuts themselves to heal them that's also I
guess quite brutal too but honestly man the reason why I like that kind of
content is it's real and we don't see real very much anymore right in the
censored world we think that everything is PC and we hear these stories about
far away places thinking they're all savages and they don't know how to
behave but those guys like the Hadza in Tanzania there's only a thousand left
and they live authentically how we did back when we were all hunter-gatherers
they're one of the last tribes in the world still living true to our very
roots and so when you see a guy whip his Johnson out and pee into a snail shell
and heal a wound with urine you're like okay that sound that that looks really
weird but they obviously have some wisdom there right they got huge right see I
wasn't sure if I could draw give me an idea like forearm like full well here's
the thing it's not quite a baby's arm with an apple okay but generally I try
not to film naked people in the videos right right sometimes a lot of the
tribes though the women don't wear shirts right so it's inevitable but with
with the guys you know if it's an ad I don't want it don't need to film that
that stuff but this guy tapped me on the shoulder pulled his pants down and said
film my he beat into a snail shell and anyway I can't put that on I can't put
that on YouTube there's that that's the behind-the-scenes stuff that I put on
Patreon actually yeah yeah yeah oh my god dude I brought you a present man did
you really I guarantee you'll never in a thousand years know what it is or guess
what it is I you're probably right about that look at this dirty stained bag
stained from whatever in there all right you ready for this is it drugs oh I
might have forgotten the told oh no it's there did it break off dude hold on
this it's it's an assemble well that didn't quite survive the this that's a
stick no this there you go it's like a Lego project you can put it together so
that is essentially a voodoo doll but not voodoo sent Santoria I got that in
Venezuela in the witchcraft market of Caracas two weeks ago so how that works
is you fill it with some sort of offering so on the top of this strange two
man's head there's two corks right you would fill it through full of blood or
see in or something like that wow and then you make it off from that one I put
my blood and see already that oh wow so I want you to put in your blood and see
the other one the sacrament and then we burn it and then we cast a spell love
or hate on somebody else now my seat is not inside they're both empty you can use
that's beautiful you can use both look at that that's incredible man thank you it
may or may not come alive at night I'm not quite sure that's the coolest thing
I've ever gotten man that's gonna live right there so I mean what they're for
is there would because you burn them and you can see yeah a lot and a lot of my
travels you see these like witchcraft these voodoo these Santoria things yeah
especially in Latin America I remember while I was doing some abandoned
exploration in Mexico City and we came across this this site where it was a
bunch of burnt chicken heads a half burnt photo of a boy and some burnt
candy wrappers and it was a Santoria spell cast on someone to make them fall
in love so though a girl would have come in there with chicken heads burnt them
with the photo of the guy and candy means it's for love or for liking and
then that's cast a spell so you would fill that full enough with an offering
and you'd burn it or you can do whatever you want with it really so you
just pack the top with whatever you want yep and then you can burn it that's
probably like a spell book for for Santoria somewhere I didn't bring that
that's amazing man yeah and he's fully erect yeah he is that's that's
incredible thank you no problem where so going back to that the tribe what's the
name of that tribe in Tanzania again the Hadza the Hadza tribe are a zombie how
many tribes like that do you think exist that are that primitive is explain what
what's the threshold I mean like that try it's that seemed like probably one of
the most I mean I know there's uncontacted tribes around the world that
will kill a human when they see them not as many as you'd think but yeah but it
seems like those guys were probably the most primitive humans that exist on
earth the what makes the Hadza unique opposed to other let's say
uncontacted tribes is because the Hadza are very contacted like it's really
hard to find uncontacted tribes even like north central island right where the
missionary got killed a decade ago or whatever like we people people or
Christians or missionaries have been traveling this world for a very long
time in pregnaing different corners of this planet with religion like we've
been doing that forever and one of my my greatest moments of sadness over and
over again is when I go to like the remote deep part of the amazon and we're
finding a shaman who lives on a hill to do a frog venom ritual and we show up
and he's got like a snake bite that's seeping and he hobbles out and he's
got like one wonky eye like that professor and harry potter and then he's
got this gold chain that has a little cross on this chest and like it's a
christian god christians but what they do is they they take they take a bit of
that and then they take a lot of their own stuff they mix it together and it's
some some like pagan slash christian type thing right right yeah it was this
funny I don't have you seen that new that new show on uh I forget what what
never gets on but it's called shogun no it's all about like uh I think it was
16th century japan and uh all these japanese people had been um there had
been other europeans that came there and basically like settled and taught half
of the culture there uh christianity so like there was all these you know
church fathers there and they were setting up churches and all of these
japanese people that were participating in like regular japanese rituals and
everything and but they were christians they were wearing crosses and they were
like very very devout christians it was wild and uh I don't know it just gave it
just goes to what you were saying about how they're impregnating different parts
of the world like throughout history with religion yeah it's interesting and then
you realize like what if like I I believe in there is a god but I mean and he's
got a thousand names right so whether you call it like god from the bible or
a la or whoever or the the sun right it's all just painting a different paint on the same
same sort of thing are those guys in tanzania are they religious at all
funniest thing is um missionaries would bring them and this is a testament to what the
hodds are really like when the with the modern world is that the missionaries would come and
be like here is the bible you must praise our god he is the only god and they're like
yo can we can smoke that bible paper because they grow their own weed and they they make
joints with the bible paper and they smoke it when I was there I didn't bring them a bible
but they're making a joint set of newspaper yeah but that's the attitude the hasa have and that's
why they they seem more uncontacted than they are because they completely reject the modern world
they want and they think it's poison they don't want anything to do with it they want nothing
to do with it wow dude no to the point where I've been there three times now on three different
expeditions hunting with them and we'll be out there running through thorn bushes there's a
there's a horrid plant there that's called the weight a bit acacia and acacias are generally
like these big thorny bushes and it's called a weight a bit acacia because instead of a
straight spine it's a it's a fish hook and so you run and you get an arm full of fish hooks
and you have to wait a bit as you pull out all of the thorns and my white boy marshmallow skin
can handle it so keeping up with those guys is not not to mention a complete cardio blowout yes
up and down boulders and and scree and all that kind of stuff there it is weight a bit
acacia look at those thorns that's it I love this this is awesome to be able to say things and have
a pop up isn't that beautiful that first photo so you you get a bunch of those in your arm and you
tear some holes in your shirt and your skin and you got to wait a bit to tear them out and they're
everywhere but the hodds have been running through the forest forever and their skin's
like elephant skin right so they don't give a shit man but it's that's why it's hard to film them
and there's not that many good videos is because most people can't like you can't you can't handle
the landscape it's horrible and what is their their language is like tongue clicks yeah it's
called had had zane had zane yeah and it's is it all clicks or are they're different like
are there different sort of idioms or like different ways that that they use the language
is it do they have any sort of is there any sort of connection to any other african languages
yeah they they speak their own language but i think it's all i'm not like a linguist here but
i think it all has a very similar root to i think it's maybe the san people in south america
don't kill me if i'm wrong but there's a few click languages that i think have a similar root
but um a lot of clicks and it's really interesting and part of that tribe too is this this boldness
when you hear them talk sometimes too that's it's very full and energetic and very directive
and the tribe's very interesting because there's not really a chief per se there's a hunter
that maybe is a bit better that kind of guides the group but they're they're quite independent
each one of them but anyway you're out in the bushes and you're you're trying to keep up and
you're there and let's say we haven't caught anything yet because generally when you catch
something you eat it so let's say everyone's hungry and i was there with with one of my boys and
we had some quest bars or whatever and uh they wouldn't touch them they wouldn't touch anything
that wasn't just straight honey they love interest they they think it's poison i actually did a an
interview with them i did like a question and answer video with them about their beliefs which was
hilarious because with these hunter gatherer tribes you think that they would have very
interesting answers to what's the most important thing in life how do you be happy right and so
maybe you can guess but what's the most important thing in life to me well to let's say to them to
them i mean i already know the answer okay meat meat how do you what's the key to happiness
meat and everything so it's hard to get these these philosophical answers because they're
they're day to day is just go out survival yeah and all this this shit we take on the rest of
our lives man it's just problems of a life where we have all of our bases taken care of
have they seen like videos or pictures of like new york city
i don't know they don't have phones um i again but with the hodds it's it's strange because
they are one of the very few tribes in the world that actually reject reject modernity
whereas you can go see the messiah or you can go to the amazon and you might go to a tribe that
looks like they're living traditionally but they got like a cell phone and they maybe they
like if you go see a tribe you pay for a tour often what happens in many parts of the world
is you go to a tribe and they they hear tourists are coming they take off their jeans and their
t-shirt and then they put on their loincloth or whatever and then you have a authentic experience
which is still like i'm not completely against that they still they still are showing you what
the culture is but to find a true authentic living how you would imagine and fantasize tribe man that
has been the most difficult thing about my job finding these people but also the most rewarding
when you do because you can't just say oh i want to go see the hadza or the messiah or whoever
you have to really ask the right questions find the right contacts get the right guides and then
you can have the most holy as in like whole experience possible but it's difficult because
again there's very few tribes that are that are living completely traditionally because
most people want to have a phone it's very convenient and have like a shingle roof and cattle
you know what i mean like why why wouldn't you want that why would you want to go hunting every
single day for food when you can go buy a six pack of beer and get some cookies at the at the store
or some chickens or some cows it's just so much more work to hunt so the fact that the hadza
what makes them unique is that they they are true to their life they live in symbiosis with other
tribes like the detuga is one of them that have rejected hunting and keep cattle because it's so
much easier and one of the biggest problems the hadza have is that they have these other tribes
with their cows going through the jungle scaring away all of the the animals and they can't hunt
so that's what makes them unique is that they they develop nothing to do with the modern world
how did you first hear about them i was in i used to have a tv show on bbc called the travel show
and i was with uh my contact in in tanzania called gumbo and we were recording a video about a
coral reef that's by mount kilimanjaro like a really interesting story and i think i heard
david show talk about it on rogan years ago but there wasn't any contact contacts or content about
it on on the internet at the time and so i asked him because we were already in tanzania and he
had thought he had heard about this tribe that there's like a thousand left in the west part
of the country and it took a while of of joining the dots together yeah he did like a vice piece
over there right i think that's what it was yeah i remember him talking about that too yeah that's
how we originally found it so you got there and you found a fixer or a guide that basically could
speak their language and they can they have a relationship with these guys and they're able
to introduce you and they're like what is their incentive to bring you in and let you film all
this stuff at the tribe yeah those tribe those days we would bring a donation okay so this is
generally how it always works i'll give you another example uh last year i went to go visit a tribe
called the ostrich footed tribe or the vadoma that's in the northern zimbabwe very rare people
that they live in the mountains and the scientific side of it is that they inbred so much that their
feet have two toes like lobster claws and the their story is that they're that's them we were there
yeah we were there last last fall whoa look at their feet dude yeah that's wild so they but they
believe that their their great great great grandmother came down from the sky she was a bird
and or maybe he was a bird and she he impregnated a local person and now they have bird feet ostrich
feet but there's no connection up there it's very rural so to be able to get that we had to work
for months to be able to find the right contact who could get the people together to meet us to
then do a meeting with the local village elder to then get permission and blessing from the tribe
and then we had to go there specifically to be able to meet with another leader and so generally
there's four or five people in this chain where you have a a fixer for zimbabwe and then a fixer
for like the province another fixer for the local location and then you have to make happen that way
yeah that is insane next to dactyl is what's called it looks like they they have uh there's
they're really big feet mm-hmm and if you look at her hands on the left actually uh it affects
both hands and feet in some people so her hand on the left you can see her her right hand has
also a bit of a claw oh god yeah it was a very interesting story but
this is it brings up an interesting question dude is like because of the modern world now we have
more migration of people the tribes are intermingling it's it's almost gone there's you can go to
these villages and there's only in the population there was probably like 400 people and there was
only maybe seven or eight who had it so common but not as common as it used to be which i think
most of the tribes had it because the world's so connected these things are going away and yeah
like genetic deformities are they the it's not a you'd want them to go away right but also so does
some of the magic of the world at the same time you know what i mean when when as the world opens up
and i'm not wishing there's more people with genetic deformities but as the world opens up
and all of these very specific things um are getting exposed and we're intimate intermingling
more the cool shit's going away bro like literally we're like the last generation so the omo valley
in ethiopia the big-ass lip plates you know ever seen those photos yeah there's very few people with
those left now because they don't they see the hollywood they see hollywood movies they see the
ragatone videos and those people don't have it and that's what successful is their grandmother
might but who wants to be like their grandmother and so the cool the cool shit's just slowly
going away oh man yeah you can see they have the horns there so incredible right yeah man
that's fascinating shit so okay so you so you got there to um to those guys in tanzania
and you guys went on a you followed them on like a baboon hunt or they were they were they
targeting baboon or were they just trying to go find anything they could they could get they'll
eat to feed the village they'll eat anything and these are like and you didn't necessarily like
stay in a village proper they were these guys were more like a nomad hunting tribe they would have
they have a main camp and they have hunting camps so i've gone three times the first time we went to
the main camp um but generally we would stay in hunting camps which would be a couple little straw
shacks kind of like a lean to you know what that is yeah yeah and then from there we'd go hunt but
baboon is their favorite baboon is is the best meat that's bizarre and they love eating baboon ass
i saw that that's their favorite cut he said we like the fat ass on the baboon yeah yeah yeah yeah
because baboon asses are like huge man badonk adonks big pink fatty things so that's so wild
man and then there's that guy who nailed a baboon from like a hundred yards away in the pitch darkness
with a with a bow and arrow homemade bow and arrow his name is chaaba and yeah chaaba yeah yeah
i it was the one of the most incredible feats of human strength and ability i have ever seen in my
life i was like jumping up and down when that happened when i was watching that i couldn't i
couldn't believe it man yeah they call it going to war with baboons man because baboons are are
very aggressive and they're smart and they've got huge teeth like a lion would and they they attack
right and so you saw the video where the only way we could get them is we had to go raid their camp
at night so me and the boys snuck up in bare feet in the pitch dark with our arms in front of our
eyes so the weight a bit of caches didn't hook our eyes out and then we had to sneak up gather
rocks and then at a certain moment one of the guys had borrowed one of our flashlights and
we had to flick flick it on and we had to make monkey sounds and throw rocks at the baboons
on top of this lion king rock going and they all ran around the other side where the hunting hadza
the top guys all just fill them full arrows man so they were on top of like this big sort of cliff
type rock like a like a bluff like thread of the lion king yeah why would why do they hang out on
those because they can know the night the saint because they can see their surroundings they're
again they're not eternal no but they they would want to be in a spot just like a you'd put a castle
on a cliff right because they can see their surroundings they can see if people are are
coming and they would spend half the day there that was probably their home and they go out forage
come back but from there they could see most predators uh not the hodza their uh special
breed we had a guy in here a couple months ago maybe two months ago andrew yugels he uh he's
obsessed with hand catching animals and i forget where he was he was in some sort of some african
country i forget which one but he uh hand caught a wild baboon damn no way he tried to catch a wild
i think he failed and now he's only got one hand no yeah no he's a psycho man he's upset he's
australian and uh he goes around the world trying to hand catch these animals and i think he found
some guys like hey can you help me catch a baboon and this guy you know he just wanted to make money
right and he's like oh of course of course i know how to do this and he uh the guy caught a baboon
put it in a giant cage and he just wanted to go in the cage with it and hand catch it and um
um he basically the baboon was like so smart it somehow moved its way to the entrance of the
cage where the door was and it blocked him in so he couldn't get out and it trapped him in there
and then he ended up like climbing across the ceiling while the other guy distracted the
the baboon so he could escape like it was it was yeah that was a scary story the problem with
the world now is we see monkeys eating bananas and riding a tricycle yeah but if you see any
kind of monkey in real life they are not fun they are scary and they'll bite your face they'll
attack you they'll grab your shit man it's uh i avoid monkeys at all costs yeah they're unpredictable
and they'll they'll like they'll just bite your like they'll just tear your lips off like they
don't give a fuck you know dude there's so many scary ass stories of monkeys attacking people
there's videos of like monkey stealing children on the streets yeah it's insane no way um and then
those guys like another thing how they caught that deer and the guy literally bit its throat to kill
it like they don't have not they don't use knives or anything like that they just they just use their
teeth yeah what i didn't show in the video because i have to youtube actually has been very generous
with with my content because there is some stuff in there that is very real and graphic
but they're documentaries so in a documentary setting and i'm not trying to glorify violence
or anything i'm just trying to show how the world is right but what what you didn't see is they took
a rock the size of a a fist and just smash that poor little thing's cranium three four times
then bit the throat as it cried oh yeah and they were biting its ear to try to get it to cry to
call its mother in right because it was a baby deer you bite the ear it goes and then the mom
comes back being like well you're doing my baby and you shoot the mom but the mom didn't come back
thank god but uh that's their technique that's brutal dude there's a maybe by the time this
comes out the the sequel will be will be posted but oh really we went back again to because i found out
that socoro the one of the better hunters has a motorcycle and i was like how the how the
fuck did he get a motorcycle and why like what does he do with it and because again they're
supposed to reject modernly but but we are again coming to a world where there's a lot of very
convenient things out there that at a certain point it's like i'd much rather drive my motorcycle
to the market instead of walk for two days you know what i mean and what they use it for is they
use it to trade honey to get arrowheads because they don't work metal how do you get metal out in
in the outback or the bush so they would get they would get honey the hans are famous for their
honey as well because no one else is crazy enough to hack open a beehive in a tree and get stung
they take this honey and they trade it for arrowheads and so the the little pseudo documentary
is showing the process of them getting the honey and then getting on the bike which is the most
hilarious thing ever man these like hunter gatherers with their bows and arrows and their gazelle
gazelle skins like 300 bike just like zooming dude the shot of you riding in the car and there's
like a gopro shot where like yeah they could dash cam and this dude you guys are in this car and you
guys have this like primitive hunter gatherer ride in the middle just like yeah where so they
so they catch honey and they where do they go to trade this stuff they're not too far from
small villages so the the other tribe i said that they live alongside the detuga they work metal
and how they work metal is they take generally the shells from bullets i don't even know where
they get the shells from but when we saw them making the arrowheads they had the casings for
bullets and they would melt those down in a let's call it a forge but basically it's a guy with two
canvas sacks going like this blowing air into the fire and then they'd have a little metal trough
and they'd melt the the casings down into like a liquid and they'd form that into an arrowhead
and the hodza have i don't know like seven different kinds of arrowheads really yeah i was shocked at
how many different types of weapons they have different types of arrows yeah and so for those
ones the ones that are made of metal generally it's for the baboons which have hooks on the side
so it's a big point like a flat point with hooks because you shoot a baboon and can pull the arrow
out because it's got hands you shoot a deer and it can't do that so those are generally wood
and they have for birds they put like a corn cob section on the end and they shoot the bird so
it's like a concussive force it's and it's honestly a little bit funny to see a bird go poof
and and then it just falls yeah they'll literally they'll catch anything man they're catching they
were catching uh all kinds of rodents climbing inside of trees up at the center of these giant
hollowed out trees with bees just crawling all over their bodies stinging them not even flinching
the uh in this this one that i'll be posting soon it was there was one of the most graphic scenes
of them hunting which was there's this really cute animal if you could pull it up called a bush
baby a bush baby it's like the cutest pokemon on on planet earth and there i thought they were
quite endangered oh look at that look at that with the blue thing it's adorable and there was one
day we went out and they got like seven it was a genocide and and they shoot them with with those
concussive arrows but for because if you have the big blade you just slice them open and it
but with a concussive you knock them out and what so yeah and they jump really well you'll
probably see it in a second looks like a what's it called a lemur it's like a lemur yeah yeah
so they're the cutest little things big eyes and they've got big long legs to jump with
and so i watch these guys shoot them with the arrow it falls out the thing the poor thing stunned
they grab it hold it up take their femurs with their bare hands snap the femurs so taking the leg
snapping the leg with a big crack snapping the other leg with a big crack and then taking this the
poor i don't know who gave you this but i'm not going to break it that's okay taking the head
and just crunching the skull into its eyes go and then saucuro takes it and then tucks it in my
belt in your belt yeah and then we keep going and this is the kind of i'm like this is such a brutal
thing but it's how they do it and i i wish you could see i wish you could be there because you
would just see how this is how they've done it forever and it's i wouldn't say it's wrong
it's definitely not right either but who am i to go in their kitchen and their backyard and and and
get all my panties and twist about things like right i don't again i wouldn't do it myself there's
i think participation is a big important part of travel but there's a certain point where it's like
woof a bit too much for me do you ever get any criticism for going out there and documenting
this stuff with these guys with these tribes people call me like a neocolonialist they all
sorts of things but what what you don't see is this episode of the podcast is brought to you by
mudwater mudwater is a coffee alternative containing four adaptogenic mushrooms with only a
fraction of the caffeine is a cup of coffee you get energy without the jitters or the crash of coffee

grand gestures to to these tribes i mean and the ones that that use money get get money like we
like the african you would think that trips to africa would be cheap man they're not if you
want to live like a local and take local buses and then yeah you could probably get by a little
bit cheap but if you want to stay in a hotel with reliable power and a bed and you want to be able
to stick to a production schedule to actually get shit done you're spending like 20k for two
three weeks out there and that money goes mostly to the local people the tribes and stuff of course
like the facilitator gets some too but we we make sure everyone's taken care of and so if anything
like yeah no one's ever really upset that were that were there people throw all kinds of stones
on the internet but uh it's it's we have fun yeah how prevalent is drug use in those tribes
and then what and what kind of drugs are they using i know you said marijuana but is a real
actual like the weed we're used to like the weed we're used to know we make some in weapon
grade shit up here now like bush weed so you can actually smoke it enjoyably and not uh not go to
outer space but the places i've seen weed have only been in rural africa um and in like pakistan
i haven't seen weed many other places pakistan huh dude pakistan we were there and we uh the first
day we get out we're in islamabad which is on the more safer side of things and the local contact
wants us to take wants to take us to the the scenic viewpoint to watch sunset and so you're
like i'm jet lag is all right let's go you know and then we get out we open the door and then
there's a ditch filled with weed like it's just literally a weed weed is a weed just the entire
countryside is dope man it was it was i couldn't believe it either like growing in the yeah just
as a weed so uh and they they would say smoke it of course they do but it was growing everywhere
there what how is how is it viewed there in pakistan like what what is there any sort of like uh
cultural bias or is it looked frowned upon or like compared to what it's like here in america
i would think it's still it's still illegal there oh is it okay but i mean so are like
silla sabin mushrooms here but you can find silla sabin mushrooms if you know what you're
looking for right anywhere but okay generally the the thing you see most places is alcohol
and not in a good way alcohol is a sleeping potion man it's um the sad thing is a lot of
tribes i see just getting wrecked by alcohol really yeah yeah uh yeah it's really sad yeah
especially in ethiopia where you see a lot of these more iconic tribes like in lip plates and
body paints and things like that all have trouble with alcohol uh the hadza don't for whatever reason
maybe they found pot instead and pots a bit more functional but a lot of places alcohol is is just
corrupting the tribal life i heard that uh opium is a big thing out somewhere like in some countries
in africa i've never seen it personally no or maybe it's not opium maybe it's a different plant
that has like a oh cot maybe no cot's a stimulant right i think this was a different one this was
like uh something that's really similar to opium but cot is very prevalent in that area too right
especially on ethiopia ethiopia yemen places like that tried it it was a lot of work man
we went to have this really fun experience in in harar this place in in ethiopia harar is famous
for one particular thing that you might see content about but it is a man called the hyena man who
has domesticated hyenas and every night he goes out and you can put a piece of meat on your shoulder
and there'll be a hyena come and eat it and you can put it in your mouth like lady in the tramp
and a hyena will come bite it out of your mouth in this place called harar where there was like the
cleanup they were the cleanup crew for the city for a long time anyway there we had cot and we
it's they're selling it everywhere and we sat in the in a cot den so it was almost like this small
little dark amphitheater place with like music and espresso and you just sit there and chew green
leaves like a cow for like an hour and a half for like a medium high to get higher off a fucking
three milligrams in than you would chewing on a like literally a grocery bag of that shit for an
hour really i we treat we treat is it similar to zen no i i chewed a basketball's worth in an hour
and and felt i felt less than this coffee i felt like i was a bovine man i felt like a cow in a field
oh my god somebody needs to fucking do an airdrop a zin zimbabwe just change it all
but apparently people say it's addictive and our local guide there was really against it
really really really against it everyone was walking around carrying a little bag full of it
and he said it made people lazy and i really i just saw people sitting around chewing a lot
of chewing but it really i don't know how much you'd have to chew man but i got really impatient
after an hour i had this dude on here one time this uh uh eric zuleger he uh he went to this place
called somali land which is like right next to somalia yeah and uh i think he was the ambassador
they made him the ambassador to some other country anyway so he was the ambassador for like a month
and he was explaining to me how prevalent cot was and how everybody there was just like
addicted to cot and they had like their teeth were their teeth were falling out and their lips
were rotting away um and there's like a big there's like a lot of like pirates out there too right
in somalia yeah off the between somalia and i guess it's probably yemen or or whatever it is yeah
it's pirates are a big problem somalia is not a place you generally want to go but yeah cot's
very famous there too and i i think again i only had that one experience but i think one of the
biggest problems too is because people can get addicted apparently and then from there when
you're trying to grow crops you have there's more like if you're a farmer and you have a
field and you can make more money with cot than anything healthy like a vegetable or whatever
then you're just going to grow cot because you want money and so there's more and more cot fields
less less and less actually crops to eat for agriculture and so i think and cot takes a lot
of water so i think that's the biggest problem is that farmers want money so they grow that and
there's less food and less water available to to water the crops and all that kind of stuff
against the biggest problem right how far is um where you were from zimbabwe i i've been always in
zimbabwe last year but zimbabwe's down near south africa kind of like it's down farther south okay
you know like madagascar where it is kind of like if you go up diagonally to the west of madagascar
ethiopia is kind of more up near egypt oh yeah perfect we got a map there you there you go
i'm geographically challenged i wasn't almost right it's more across but yeah
yeah so that's where the austrian footed tribe was it was that they were in zimbabwe
okay dude i also i also try to get my nose pierced by a local tribe in in zimbabwe when i was there
you tried yeah you didn't succeed no we succeeded oh okay we succeeded we succeeded um if you want
to pull it up quick it's it's yeah pull that one up so i i had this because i really what i want to
do is i want to have the most authentic experience possible possible right and so one when i was in
ethiopia i went there and i i was able to get scarified like scarification where they take
a blade and a thorn and they actually scar your body
so if you go down it's like the second row uh go back to go back to video yours there yeah
go down a little bit more there we go getting my nose pierced by tribal grumpy tribal grandmas
that's it so the the idea was that turn the volume down so we can talk with the little the idea was
that after that experience it was just so cool to be able to like if you do the local they'll
treat you like a local yeah what i the comparison i always give is like if you if if i contacted
you saying hey i want to come to your house for christmas because i've never had an authentic
christmas before and i'm from nigeria and can i come and you're like yeah man um come on the
24th and so i show up on the 24th i'm excited to to have christmas with your family authentic
american christmas whatever and then you're like all right well now it's time to do the turkey
and i'm like oh no turkey's kind of gross man i uh i brought my own baboon
so hallowed baboon shank yeah you're very rude right yeah you'd be bringing like a chocolate bar
or a quest bar and you sit in the back and uh and you don't have it you'd be kind of like what
you know i mean so um but if you go and you do what the locals do they'll treat you like a local
just like if i was there and i had the dinner i'm like cutting the turkey and you'd be like oh he's
he's awesome right same with this the mistake i made though with this tribe was that i assumed that
all of the ladies with the nose piercings could give the nose piercings and it turns out that they
also smoke these big bongs they had weed as well and they uh it's more at the end you can see it
as well we all smoke together but they smoke these big ass bongs and they get super high and so these
ladies were actually completely ripped off weed and tobacco and we got nakasha thorn and i thought
i just i thought it'd be like a little pop boop done she went slow and it took her 15 minutes
bro 15 minutes of pushing and twisting and then taking it out and putting in and taking it out
putting it in oh god dude it was the worst and at a certain point it was halfway through oh no that
does not look good it was halfway through and then when you keep going do you stop they couldn't
even pull it out at a certain point this lady's got you in a freaking rear naked choke and she's
shoving this stick right through your sep what is that your septum yeah and so the lady on the left
is completely grossed out and it turns out none of them knew how to do it they had no idea
did any of them bathe do they bathe there there's not much water i don't know if they would bathe
do they smell um no you know how like people here you know like you know you can tell when
someone like doesn't take a bath they have a certain smell to them yeah no they don't smell
they don't no because the body's got like natural defenses to that stuff when you're out there right
yeah i think we don't give our body a chance anymore man right right if we're always using
toothpaste and shampoo and right and sunscreen the body can't do its thing that's what i'm saying
like it's gotta be it's gotta be so much to uh uh dude um it was interesting though because
did they go all the way it is left it there no that's they couldn't go any farther i know i
didn't want them to dig it right 15 minutes this point all right you're over it at that point
trying to yeah but the idea is like listen we we take a lot of precautions it's not as
as reckless and stupid as you think so i made everybody like sanitize their hands
we made sure we did like proper as much as we could how are they sanitize their hands i brought
some oh and so we sanitize the tools like with the thorn we sanitize as well and then after
the idea was to keep it in there but they did such a poor job that there was they would have got so
infected so i kept it for like two days and then luckily with with some topical antibiotics
it was all right what is the leading cause of death in these places i would say probably
dysentery or in the sense of getting getting um dysentery dysentery yeah yeah to me tomorrow
yeah what yeah what is dysentery what does that mean i think it's just uh a slow death by diarrhea
what i think so whoa unless it's a particular disease but i think it's more just not being able
to get adequate um nutrition and also having parasites parasites yeah and just because dysentery
is not a not a parasite per se i think it's just that you you can't stop having diarrhea based on
and you just get to hydration and and and diseases and things like that oh contagious
intestinal infection that causes bloody or mucosid diarrhea can also lead to other symptoms oh
yeah i would think something getting clean water is always a pain right like for them to get clean
water there there was a and my buddy got his ear done oh nice yeah i would have started with the ear
yeah they were they were the raddest though those women were really so much fun
but again like my i i guess people can look at that and think i'm a little bit crazy but like
i can i take my job really seriously man i can tell
for a lot of these tribes they don't see foreigners that often and and so if if you're
gonna go hang like i want to be able to number one have the full experience because i like that
number two i want to be able to make them feel good about the experience and that i'm not thinking
they're weird or gross for doing their practices because for them it's it's everyday stuff and
i feel a duty to to you guys like anybody watching to to be able to document it effectively because
i can be the the presenter and be like oh here we are in in africa and here are the the the savages
and they're eating their gazelle and oh and you go in and get the b-roll and you're you're like in a
little metaphorical bubble of your own you know protection and you're not getting in there but
i want to get in there see it do it show you get dirty like take a couple hits along the way
and take the precautions to not get too sick after i get sick all the time man i literally
have diarrhea now from water in venezuela but but the idea is that i want to capture it authentically
so the world can see what it's really like and you can only have that experience that experience
is only unlocked if you go and you show up and you participate right right yeah it's so refreshing
to watch your videos dude i was i was binging your videos from like eight a.m. until now and is
it's it's refreshing to me i'm i'm so jealous because i sit here and i just talk and use words
but when you go out there and you literally experience that shove sticks through your nose
smoke weed in newspapers with these uncontacted tribes or somewhat uncontacted very remote
tribes it is like it's an experience that is really really difficult to put into words you
really have to be there yeah with those people and like spending time with them to understand
what that's like words just won't do it justice and what youtube helps with is that or at least
this style of capturing which is a bit more vlogging um we saw ben on the camera for a second
bends my videographer from from london one of the only guys i could find who could keep up and
be masochistic enough to enjoy these trips sometimes but um uh the idea is like i lost my
train of thought man what was i saying i forget well what did i say i don't know we've talked
about the tribes how it's crazy you can't put it into words crazy experience right youtube youtube
yeah being able to capture it that way like on a vlog so we can sit down together and me you the
viewer whatever and we were there in it opposed to being recorded on a telephoto lens from a distance
that's not immersive but being there where you can hear the hands move the the the grass or whatever
right like being immersed inside that allows you to feel like you're actually part part of the tribe
and that that's where that's where i thrive man my entire life i i always sucked in school
i got i was a cd student but when i did a field course because those were available sometimes
and i was out there i was a plus student flipping over rocks finding bugs chest deep and tide pools
pulling out algae like that was always me but put me in a classroom where i can't touch and feel
anything and i i i bomb right out and i was always really passionate about the things that
were misunderstood i think now that i've done a bit more soul searching um because i think i was
misunderstood so my my quest from the beginning was to prove to people that these misunderstood
things are really really cool so that was like snakes and salamanders and spiders when i was a
kid but now it's countries and people and foods and festivals all of that i just i really get excited
showing people things that they they're like oh that's gross and weird but those words are just
ignorant excuses for not understanding something right yeah it's just different man like it who's
to say our understandings any better than their understanding we're just two different people
two different attitudes right yeah i think the the one thing i think that stuck out to me the most
like when you said you were interviewing that one guy and you asked him what the most important
thing to him was is like the primary value and he said meet and it's like a lot of these cultures
out there a lot of people that live in africa and these remote places they are their their number
one worry is survival and it's amazing to me first of all that they can exist at the same time that
we can exist over here driving around in electronic cars using iPads and you know smoking vapes
whatever running around basically wearing you know whatever these helmets are that we can
the google helmets that you can live in virtual reality at the same exact time in different parts
of the world but like it is it is like the complete antithesis of that what they are living in
and meet is the most important thing and survival is the most important thing to them and um
you know there's there's i know there's like a big poaching problem in some parts of africa and
there's people out there who get paid lots of money to shoot rhinos or elephants or whatever for
their for their ivory and for their tusks i guess they ask they export it to china there's a huge
demand in china for that stuff yeah and i know there's um americans that go over there to try to
help counter the poaching but it's and it's a it's a sort of a paradoxical problem because you have
these people out there who are killing these animals that we in america think are like so sacred
and they're they're endangered and that's true they are it's like what you were getting to earlier
with how brutal they are killing animals but it's like when you need to kill the sacred animal to
feed your kid it's different like if your kid is starving are you willing to go kill an are you
willing to go murder an elephant or or endanger rhino to save your kid probably um and it's just
to me it's interesting to see um like western values get sort of projected across the people
that lives in the in these parts of the world and i was just curious to your perspective on
all that well it's it gets really philosophical right because i think of like a zebra for example
right beautiful animal and over here like they're quite special right but if they were to kill a
zebra over there for food and we maybe we would be against that or even like a lion for example but
like what makes one animal more valuable than another animal right like being endangered okay
that's that's valid but like intelligence is that something we value like a dolphin or like a
porpoise yeah but pigs are pretty smart man pigs are smarter than a lion is right or an elephant
but we kill i don't know how many kill like they don't even talk about it like so then okay so if
it's not intelligence then is it cuteness maybe but we can't say cute things are worth more than
less cute things that's a slippery slope when it comes to people and so then what what what
base do we value animals and so what animals are okay to eat and ones which ones aren't right and
that's something that we run into a lot with the tribes like you had mentioned where we're out
there we're in the jungle and they find a cute bush baby and in my head i'm like oh my god like
i can't i don't even want to see it and they're like breaking the femurs biting the brain and
it's just food it's just food and my my cultural attachments to these animals are very different
than theirs for them everything's on the menu for me there's definitely like a totem pole of which
animals are are more valuable but why you know what i mean for me i grew up in in new brunswick
canada so like right above main and there's moose everywhere there i like i don't care but we see
moose hit the people hit moose all the time they kill themselves they kill the moose and no one
thinks anything of it if you see one dead but an australian probably thinks a moose is pretty cool
and they put a higher in the totem pole for me it's just kind of like this big ass horse right
that's killed a couple of my friends honestly so people hit them dude like oh wow you think you
think a moose is um like a horse it's bigger and back up like up in that part of the country
of the continents you they come out at night they're they're black you drive in your car
don't see them you take the legs out and the the moose comes right through the windshield and just
takes the whole top half off man happens all the time it's it's interesting we just had uh i
have said this other guy on here who he made this movie called the cove where they slaughter
dolphins in japan and taiji japan yeah have you seen that it's crazy man they they like they
take these fishing boats out into the harbor or out into the ocean and they basically like
herd all these porpoise into this little tiny cove harbor and they uh put a net across it so
they can't escape and they take sticks and they just stab them to death and you see these dolphins
like and then they have people from like seaworld and dolphinariums to come in and like look at
them all before they kill them say like find the pretty little bottle nose dolphins and they'll
pay like upwards of a hundred hundred fifty thousand dollars to bring them to their their
dolphinarium or their like water park seaworld type place and they were feeding the dolphins
the dolphins they were killing they were feeding the meat to all the people in the community like
they were giving it to the government to give out to the school so the government was paying them
for the dolphin meat and they were basically giving out the dolphin meat as free lunches to
the children of school and then there was a crazy epidemic of uh people getting mercury poisoning
because dolphin is high in mercury because they're super pelagic you know i mean open open ocean fish
yeah um and they had to do all this you know they had to like go there and protest and there was
like suing the government over it like this guy rick you know he's a super um big time dolphin
conservationist and he was he literally sued the japanese government over this many times went over
there and you know they were fighting about it saying this goes back into our culture for for
you know however many centuries and then you know you have the whole stigma of the united states
bombing japan and they don't want to do what we want them to do and it's just it gets really
really really messy it gets complicated and again for us it's absolutely appalling like no excuses
and for them it's something they've been doing forever and who's right and who's wrong i like
to think that they shouldn't be slaughtering porpoises and dolphins right but there's no
international police that can go in and control that kind of stuff but where do you draw the line
right so like something like that or like like fgm like a female general mutilation in africa
you know like that's a that's a cultural figure to that before no oh dude there's like a whole
right of passage where they they literally cut off for the sake we're on youtube now like certain
parts of the female genitalia so they don't feel and they saw that shut happens right so that's a
cultural practice that still happens today by the way and it's slowly being banned and phased out
and that should be because it's absolutely terrible okay so mostly north in africa human rights
violation that affects 230 million girls and women in 30 african countries in the middle east
and asia but there's a there's a lot of ways that it can be done sometimes just you take off the
with some sort of sharp knife or you can sew the shut completely it's it's horrible why do they do
that just tradition most of those countries there would be muslim countries so i would assume
it as some ties to the female modesty things like that oh my god so obviously should not exist in
this planet it's horrible then for example uh in ethiopia we said there's the lip plates right
where little girls before they can consent to anything have their lips cut and they have put
the the dish in which is not as invasive but we interviewed a girl there who said i wish i didn't
have it and she had this huge sagging like floppy lip because her father chose to put that interface
and now she doesn't have it but you can't get rid of the scar it's like those dudes who have
used to have like the like plug earrings what are they called oh yeah and they have like a big
like floppy ears yeah like you can't fix that you know what i mean right right so okay then is that
too much maybe but then like where where's the line for things we should make a human rights
violation or not or like things we should discourage or encourage like for example one that i saw in
the amazon a few years ago as we were doing this um this trip by like dugout canoe and there's a
place called the ticia which is in the southern part of columbia um where it's a triangle between
brazil peru and columbia and there's like the amazon river goes every which way we were doing a
some dugout canoe camping visiting villages meeting people along there and we came to this village
where there was all of these young girls who uh just had like a little loincloth around their
waist and they were all like blue like navy navy blue and there's a certain berry i think it's called
wechel with an h that when you squeeze the berry it makes a clear fluid but then when it goes on
skin and oxidize as it turns deep deep blue what country did you say again this was in it was probably
in brazil but it's anywhere in in the amazon it exists we had started our journey in columbia
but all these girls were blue and we were asking questions and they were saying oh there's a
it's now getting to the time of of their lives where they're going to have their first menstruation
and then what happens is they get colored blue and then very shortly they'll go into a hut
like a grass hut in the darkness they'll spend one month in this hut the women of the village
will come in and they'll pluck out each hair of their head individually so until they're bald
and as they pluck out each hair in their head individually they'll teach them by candlelight
what it means to be a woman and then after a month they'll come out they'll be bald they'll
be blue and they'll be a woman and there were there was a human human rights group that was
had been in there a few months ago they were saying that was trying to ban this right of passage for
women and that was very interesting because that that would not be fun by any means right that's
painful but it's it's well intentioned it's not as as heavily intentioned as FGM for example you
know I mean and then it's like for men especially like pain is so necessary sometimes you know what
I mean like men I feel need pain and challenge to be able to actually become men and you see
that those rights of passage all over the world too right where there's some sort of like another
example of the Amazon is there's the this episode of the podcast is brought to you by
verso the older I get the more I want to invest in my health because I don't just want to look young
I want to feel young recent scientific findings demonstrate that it is not only possible to slow

Maui Sowie tribe oh this is like Maui Sowie Maui Sowie Steve see we see we see for us we're looking
at bullet ant gloves right now as we're looking at where they take these bullet ants which are these
good inch long ants that are called bullet ants because when you're stung it feels like a bullet
and they put a hundred in each glove and they weave these these these gloves out of reads
and you the guy puts his hand in the boy and he gets stung hundreds of times over 15 minutes
probably thousands of times by bullet ants and he dances and I think he does it like twice a week
for a month or something like that where it's just the most extreme pain possible and like
scarification in Africa or like vision quests or like pain just seems to be the thing that humans
need to be able to change their lives and so you see things like that and I'm not totally on
board with having as people's hair pulled out one by one but we can't give people no pain because
in a world today where we have very little pain we're struggling more than ever right right so
as much as we don't want to be that's a bullet ants yeah those things are scary dude if you put
in bullet ant glove I've heard I've heard stories about these things Paul Rosely has talked about
these oh man there we go bullet ant glove oh my god look at that that's it look at that dude
that makes my heart pump right now just thinking about it man Mao Mao way
huh well I'm gonna scroll no scroll down by the photo I don't want to watch the video we'll get
copyrighted I think it wasn't there yeah so that's not fun but I've never tried it
but again like a pain do people the humans need pain should we remove all pain and discomfort for
me humans life yeah well we're doing it here definitely in the United States we don't uh
you know we're building a culture to avoid pain you know so everything's about distractions and
comfort it's the opposite of what your youtube channel is well that's honestly part of the
reason why I do it man is because I feel that if I have a challenge on the horizon or I have really
a proper spectrum of what pain and discomfort is and I can come back into the everyday life and
accurately assess how much pain and struggle I have but I think the human soul needs struggle
and I don't think it's a coincidence that with the the least amount of required struggle ever
in our existence we are struggling more than ever I think there's a direct correlation between
those two things yeah what um so moving on from Africa you have you went to Indonesia and you
documented this like death cult tribe these people that they seem like they're they're modern they
seem like they're modern relative to the um Tanzanian tribe because these people are walking
around in pretty like blue jeans and collared shirts and they have iPhones yet they like venerate the
dead they have this bizarre culture where they keep their dead relatives in their houses for years
and then and then what they sacrifice animals and that's supposed to shuttle them to the afterlife
yeah so that's in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi which is not a very common place for people to go
and it's the cult's a funny word there can you find that map Steve so you can show us
so we can see like where exactly that is in Indonesia uh Sulawesi Sulawesi it's the island
that looks like a llama what made you how did you discover this place I I don't remember how I
first saw it I generally have a big uh big map like a google map where I pin everything I come
across on instagram or on youtube or whatever and eventually that all comes together in the trips
yeah this was wild how in the did they carve those per the square cutouts in the giant boulder
yeah by hand bro so how long did that take so it's interesting oh I I saw one um take some
take some I don't even know for five years or something like that what so it's incredible
as you go there and um I was searching this out because I had a really tough time dealing with
my grandmother dying and she was the sweetest old lady and just the most perfect grandmother
when when she heard we'd come she'd spend days baking cookies and pies and she'd have a whole
pile of things ready and she'd be waiting at the top of the driveway and she'd give us big hugs and
she slowly succumbed to Alzheimer's and then dementia and died I couldn't make it back
to to see her die I got stuck in a snowstorm in Toronto I was in I don't know where I was Africa
someplace couldn't get back in time um and made us the funeral but I didn't get to say goodbye
and had a really hard time digesting that that part of my life and so it made me really question
what death was what it meant I had been in Mexico a little bit and knew a bit about they of the dead
and how their their understanding of death is a little bit different where you can still hang out
with your grandfather grandmother after they die you go to the grave you play the music you bring
the food you have a little party it's on Halloween isn't it or close to Halloween yeah right after
the last day of October right and and then from there I started to think more about death and
and our culture and how I didn't like we're all scared to die you know that's something that's
very common is is a fear of death and so I came across these uh this this walking dead festival
was what it's called and this place is called Toraya uh where where look at that wall dude yeah
how tall is that wall oh you can see us sitting down on the bottom so yeah yeah quite tall but
they're famous for something called the walking dead festival where they take the bodies so you
see these these cliffs and they take bodies out of the caves your entire family tree and you
change their clothes and you hang out with the family the skeletons the bodies you all just
have a family reunion with cadavers what they do every couple decades rotting corpses like
often just bones right often just bones and so I went there wanting to learn more about their
view on death and I wouldn't I never would have realized how crazy it was so when someone dies
in Torayan culture they are considered sick and so by our terms they're very much deceased but by
them they've just become sick and so they keep them in the house I wanted to learn more about this
so my guide Andri you can see in the video found a family where there was two sick grandparents
again sick we got to the house they invited us in they were super excited to see us they said that
Grammy and Grampy wanted to see us too that they had been sick for a while Grammy had died five
three years ago I think somebody that and the other had died three weeks ago so the one that's
more decomposed had died I think believe three or four years ago and the other had just died
three weeks ago and they're waiting for their funeral but these people aren't dead okay they're
just sick and so what that means is every day the family goes in they bring them food they sing
them songs and then Grammy and Grampy still communicate to them in their dreams in the bird
song they there's still a very much a relationship between the sick and the alive and in this case
they were waiting because they were going to they were saving up for a funeral for both of them
together because funerals people spend let's say like if I was going to put it in USD equivalent
for us we they'd spend a hundred thousand USD on a on a funeral or more that's like more than
people spend on weddings here yeah it's a considered a giant party because it's the biggest party of
your life it's your death party man and you have to be sent away correctly and so there's special
water buffalo there that are bred and sacrificed for the weddings there's albino water buffalo and
so generally what you want to do is for your funeral you want to have 10 20 30 40 50 100
buffalo killed for your funeral because and there's only certain kinds of buffalo certain
certain color patterns so you want to buy a buffalo with a white head because in the afterlife once
you kill that buffalo the light gets emitted from the head you want to have and he's going to lead
the pack you want to have a buffalo with a white ass because he's going to go in the back and he's
going to light the back and so you want to have all these different buffalo with different white
sploshed patterns to be able to lead the way into the underworld and pave your way to see your
ancestors and so they have these giant death parties where they spend a hundred a thousand
dollars kill 40 buffalo all this kind of crazy and then what happens is they get buried in those
cliffs like you saw and then 10 years goes by whatever and they bring out the entire family
and I had the most beautiful realization with with my guide where I was obviously quite shocked
when they started pulling out dead bodies from from this cliff and they're filled with ants and
they're all wrapped in cloth and they're taking the cloth off and they're like there's ant colonies
living in the body it was just a lot and they're in this cave there's hundreds of coffins with
bodies and they're pulling them out one by one because they're all coming out they're all going
to be putting the sun we're all going to hang up together and they take out some great grandpay
who still has his military uniform on they give him a new cigarette they take his his skull off
his body they hold it up and they're like talking like oh look at grandpa look at grandpa give him
a cigarette and this girl comes over and she's like Mike this is my grandfather I haven't seen him
in 15 years it's so good to see my grandfather and I'm like what the fuck is going on and I'm
like andry man this is a little like too much man and he took offense and he said what do you mean
this is too much and I go like this is like these are like dead bodies like don't people get sick or
like and he goes this is your family like you came from these people like why why would you be afraid
of them I'm like well I'm not like I I just don't do this kind of stuff where I'm from he goes listen
what you guys do is that better so when when your grandmother died what happened she died you put her
in the ground a couple days later and have you gone back to the grave no right that's what your
cultural does that's that's what your culture does when someone dies you you you rush you throw them
in the ground you bury them and you never go back here we respect our dead because we came from these
people they are our ancestors they went through so many struggles they fought they survived they had
you and we respect them and therefore we have we have family reunions this way we want to show them
respect where we came from we celebrate life we celebrate death death is the biggest party
and what we do is right and what you do is wrong
and how do you argue with that I mean he's not wrong right someone dies we rush him into the
ground he was saying as well like what if someone can't make it to the funeral right then you never
get to say goodbye and that's part of the reason why they wait so long is so everyone can be there
who needs to be there it's just uncle Jerry can't make it you don't have the funeral because uncle
Jerry needs to say goodbye and the funeral is when they die so it just seems like such an unreasonable
way to respect your dead for an excessive way yes especially for a culture of people who
they got they have iPhones right yeah yeah and they're very modern they're they're very modern
people they're not a in the video I say tribe like the titles tribe but they're they're just
people who have a different view on death yeah like they're pulling these bodies corpses out of
the ground out of the cave this is like an all this is like a lot of work there's a lot of people
carrying these these fabric coffins I guess they are the fabrics there because the wood
is all rotted away okay okay like this is a lot of it seems like it's a full day's work to drag
all these bodies out of these caves yeah and to pull them out and to pull their bones out and
you know play with them and stuff I would think that every family would do one of these they're
called mananes or like walking dead festivals every couple decades that doesn't happen every year of
course so and it's mostly to refresh the the again ants get in there right right shit starts to fall
apart they go into show respect keep the graves there put some photos in again give grumpy new
cigarettes whatever whatever it be but I like oh my god you want to start you want to start a zombie
apocalypse that's how it starts man right you're there like I was getting bit by ants that were
like eating dead bodies and you're like this is how we start the world war z you know yeah no yeah
yeah definitely man that's stunning it is terrifying but it's the craziest thing is where
I'm there a little bit freaked out you know a little reserved a little like what the hell am I
getting myself into and you can you can see the smiles they're all happy they're stoked it's it's
again you haven't seen grampian 20 years man or whatever it be like everyone is just so happy
it's a big fun festival which seems so strange for something so dark
but why does it have to be that way like why does it have to be dark right yeah why does have to
be dark it's just it's just interesting like there's so many cultures throughout history from different
parts of the world that where where they treat death as like more noble than life it is almost
better they they look forward to their death right and they they build their whole culture
and all their symbolism around death like ain't like japan is a great example of that and like
where they have you know like like they have the japanese have that where that ritual where they
commit suicide yeah seppuku or seppuku when they disrespect somebody or dishonor somebody they
they disembowel themselves and it's like yeah man i mean going deeper and the deeper into the
past you get the more people are obsessed with death and it's just anyways it's just shocking
that these people are so modern and they're still like this they're it's a very normal place yeah
i mean it's a of course a little rural it's the middle of the jungle in indonesia but it's
yeah it's um it's quite incredible what is that they coin coin in the mouth to for good luck
and so they get to keep the coin i believe after yeah but it was uh it was such a cool thing man
but it really makes you think about some things about our own life and how like they they there
they believe in reincarnation do they so death is not as final as we would think this atheistic
agnostic culture we find ourselves in now and no wonder fear of death is getting more and more
because we we don't believe in any kind of faith or god or you know most of us think we
rot in the ground or we don't know we don't we definitely don't think that something's gonna
happen after but in a strong culture like that or how most people used to live there was a purpose
in death right and one thing that i think makes my life interesting is you're familiar with
Graham Hancock yeah yes so Graham Hancock is i believe a journalist by by title but he's done
a lot of books about archaeology and anthropology and things like that and and what i believe that's
true but really what made what's in my part is that he was one of the only people to go to all
of these different places and study ancient cultures so for example um like an egyptologist
would only study egypt right and so then they would have a very narrow view on egypt and they'd
be very well versed in that topic but they wouldn't be so well versed on the Aztecs or the Mayans or
the people who used to live in Angkor Wat but what was the beautiful thing about Graham Hancock's
work is that he went to hundreds of sites and started to see the similarities between all of
these places something that no one had done before and with that you see oh look there's a
little vase in the hand here in Egypt and also a little vase in a hand in Mexico it's the same
vase what's that about you know i mean or snake imagery like uh he talks about the younger dryest
impact theory with the the meteor in the sky and the rise of the water and you start to realize that
okay there's like floods that and all these different cultures and when you start to hear
all of these different stories in different places that shouldn't really be talking too much
but they're all say the same thing you ask a couple questions because there's very few
coincidences in this world and i love his work but i guess what makes my life a little bit
interesting is i've kind of done a little bit of the same thing with cultures because i visited
tribes in Siberia in Indonesia in amazon in Zimbabwe and you see certain commonalities
between people all over the world that aren't connected really as much i mean more now than
before but one thing that everyone has is some kind of faith interesting everyone except for
the modern world as well you know like we there are of course christians and muslims and things
but generally let's say if a lot of us in the modern world probably a lot of people watching
these podcasts don't really have a religious path right they don't really think too much about god or
what happens later but that is such a core part of the human experience that we've a lot of us
have rejected now but many people still have that and so for them do you think they're afraid to die
nah man like you get reincarnated you have a big party after things are good you know
and so i don't know i just like seeing how how i feel how sick a lot of us are in the modern world
and going to these more tribal or basic or traditional places and seeing how much happier
and healthier they are with these these beliefs or these lifestyles that aren't so convenient or
comfortable or faithless you know how similar are their gods or their religions in all these
different parts of the world that you've been to again or how different you'll find christianily
everywhere man oh right right but a lot of actually what's really interesting dude is we talked about
this right this is middle of nowhere indonesia three weeks ago i was in venezuela and the amazon
there and i had one of these q and a questions with the the elder from the yanomami tribe
and i asked what happens after you die and he said we take the body we put it in the woods
the animals the insects eat it for a month we come back we take the bones we grind them up
into a soup with bananas and we eat the soup the whole family has to eat the soup with the ground
bones of the deceased and the banana for whatever reason and that's because then you'll keep the
soul of your let's say grandfather in you forever so maybe even a level up from this tribe here
right and they still practice this today the yanomami in in in venezuela will eat the bones
of their deceased whoa again to keep that connection so have you when you um you said
you spent some time in south america yeah have you ever brushed up with any uncontacted tribes
uh i feel that the word uncontacted is not
is a bit confusing sometimes so to find an uncontacted tribe
like you might think north sentinel island is uncontacted right that's the one where the
missionary went and got right yeah yep it's an island um but i would imagine there's even
stories of potentially some european going there and and f**king them all up yeah what is the story
do you know that for people that are where i think the guy was uh like a missionary right and he was
trying to spread his religion or he's had trying to teach them about god and then he went there and
then he uh got them to all believe that he was some ordained uh deity or something like that
and that he had all this magic magical powers and then a bunch of them i think got sick maybe
some of the kids or a grandmother got sick and died i think he assaulted them asexually or something
like that oh no no no i'm gonna get them except taking photos of them he was taking photos of
like the kids and stuff i see i'm getting that's what it was with a rick and morty episode have
you seen that one yeah no no no i can't it just came to me though yeah i remember this guy was
taking photos of like the kids like naked and he was there there's like censored images of it online
but like the guy was a sick f**k yeah exactly so this is before john allen chow went which was recent
i think uh 2018 it seems and there was a there was a um a freighter like a freighter ship that
ran out of gas or ran aground right there and they literally like ravaged that ship within
a couple days they literally like pulled everything off the ship all of the tools all of like the
the metal like the like the whatever steering wheel it was everything they could have used
it was like it was like a colony of ants eating a carcass in a matter of days that they
stripped the ship down to nothing yeah man they're resourceful um i guess i'm not trying to burst the
bubble too much in uncontacted tribes because you'll see a lot of people throw that word around a lot
and coming from experience it is very difficult to find an uncontacted tribe
it's like in the amazon they i would guess they probably exist but again people can move
there right and us white people have been everywhere bro throwing that cross around
doing all kinds of things so um they they definitely do exist but i think like less
contact it would be a good way to put it but i think the ones that are aggressive like for
example in north central island there there is that that story of this old german or something
and that from 80 years ago i don't remember exactly when it was either that did something
bad and now there is some kind of aggression towards people coming to the island in other
places um like papa new guinea for example right we can say there's probably some uncontacted
tribes there but what's more accurate to say was there's probably some less contacted tribes
there that have had really bad altercations with illegal mining and they associate out outsiders
with uh violence because the illegal miners will shoot native tribes right if they try to
cause problems because it's the it's lawless out there right so these uncocked uncontacted
tribes who are violent probably most likely have reason to be violent like a dog that was
beaten and now bites people exactly yeah totally so and the world is very fluid you know like
people are always moving around so in the amazon part of the reason why it's so hard to to get in
there and get out of there is because there's no roads you have to go by river right and the river
also goes one way so if you're going up river which you normally are takes a long a long time
right um so for me uncontacted tribes specifically uh i i have been told i have seen some
but everything has been friendly i don't exactly know no hostile no no hostility no i have no i've
had no hostile experiences with tribes i have had one very hostile experience doing this job
i don't think i've told this story on a podcast maybe but um i have this like fetish with sleeping
in in amazing places i grew up as a boy scout and so i got camping with something you do with
like a little group and you go to a campground and then along the way i realized you can camp
wherever the you want if you don't get caught right right and so i started finding weird places to
camp and so i've camped like under africa's second biggest waterfall recently and whoa yeah in in
angola we did that and then there was a place that i found and since like we live in north america
there's not much for like castles right so i've always had a fascination for castles and i was
traveling in turkey and i found a castle called satan's castle really yeah see if you gotta find
this and i wanted to camp in a castle that was like the fantasy you know what i mean because
there's like some ruins and but i wanted to find one that was like a tower and like a rampart and
like really a castle feel but the problem is like in europe uh anyone that's still well preserved is
is like uh it's it's guarded it's got tickets you know you can't go do that you have to find one
that's abandoned but generally if it's nice it's not going to be abandoned until i found this one
in a really remote part of turkey near the border of georgia there's my video and uh it was uh you
can find a photo maybe in the very beginning oh yeah there's a yeah there's a photo of it
wow holy cow dude isn't that the most bizarre way way way way way way way all to mice look at that
look at pause pause pause pause pause okay this is gonna be important oh my god stop it steve stop
no we missed it steve oh my okay here we go um that is insane exactly that is the full castle fantasy
i didn't want to just go for these oh i slept i wanted to sleep in a in castle
how did you get there exactly exactly it looks like uh cersei's castle and game of thrones where the
dragons live uh huh it is it's it's perfect isn't it and no it is an abandoned and in the middle of
nowhere and i was country again turkey turkey near the border of the country of georgia so it's like
northeastern turkey and i'm gonna refer to this photo in a second if you want to keep it up because
it's going to be important to this to this story which is crazy mind bending so i wanted to camp as
you can see i i was able to make it happen but it was such a remote part of turkey and i had to rent
a car and drive hours from the nearest big city to get there and i didn't quite know what i was
going to get myself into i just saw a couple crappy phone photos but it looked like it was going to be
epic so i got my little tent i got it my my equipment my drone all that kind of
firewood hacked it on the way got to this uh this place and there's a road that goes to this really
kind of crappy town that's just cheap and tarps for roofs and bricks like maybe 20 little houses
and then there's this road ends and there's a little path that goes along the side of
the viewers can see it here right yeah so on the left maybe you can see it there's like a little
winding road that goes as there's like a break see on the left hand side
there's a path that goes along there then it dips down and it comes back up so i parked my car it's
like maybe like a half mile walk maybe almost a mile to walk along this little edge and then
you dip down you come back up and along the way you can see it i'm stoked i'm like oh my god it's
perfect it's perched up on this cliff like a pinnacle in this valley and i can't believe it's
actually still here and there's like nobody around and so i get there and i climb up and
i'm exploring this place and there's murder holes where they would have dropped you know like oil
down and there's tunnels and like these walls and i'm just having like a i'm a kid in a candy shop
man again as a guy who grew up here in north america we don't get to just explore a castle
there is no castles and maybe you can go to europe but there's tickets and there's
fences and like i got to be a medieval king you know when is this castle from do you know
this is where things get interesting man because um it's i think it but it's a thousand i don't
remember and this is like three years ago but basically it's been rebuilt over the years because
if you build a house and then you renovate it renovate it renovate it renovate it renovate it
how old is the house right i think the foundation you can look it up satan's castle see you will
find it again it's 500 bc 500 bc can you find a wikipedia on it i want to read about this place
so then over the years it was added to and expanded and things like that so 500 bc is
is when it was from um but then again if it was 500 bc it wouldn't be still standing completely so
they would have over time um would have stored it yeah uh that is the coolest thing i've ever seen
yeah man so epic campsite for sure and didn't see a soul so i was there exploring it the sun
was going down um having time in my life one really weird thing that i saw when i was there
though is there there was like flood lights that were around the outside but they were like broken
and the the wires were cut and looked like they had been i don't know like busted for like five
years or something like that okay and uh but i i was happy because i was like oh should they
gonna light this up because sometimes they'll light up castles at night just to make it look
nice but there's no road you can see it from no one lives out there so i thought it was strange
they would have lights but they look broken anyway so i was like okay i guess that's weird but
that's fine do you know why they call it satan's castle i think because they believed a devil
lived there really yeah steve what have you found it's tough to find uh there's there's no articles
on it so you can't find any information i found something i'm just having to dig through this
guy who went on this road trip and then oh that's he stopped by the the castle that is so beautiful
it's like calisthenics ah yeah if you look up the turkish name you'll find it because it's color
yeah is that zed it that's it that's it yeah that's it look that up weirdness google that
satan kalesi i'll get back we gotta figure out why they called it that that is nuts all right i'm
there how long did you say that yeah keep going oh i was there for well let me let me get to the
story okay okay so the idea was to spend here we go the idea was to spend the night there all right
satan you might have to translate it into english yeah what does satan mean satan it's a
i can't read that that's there we go there we go is an old castle located in the something something
village of sea sea dear district in our dahan province the castle is a historical insuti region
is referred to as this is a hard thing to read man devils the devils okay the devil's castle
yeah in the georgian sources and it is and is the date of the ottomans capture of the region
the name of the castle was later translated from georgian there are opinions that the kakta
see he mentioned in the epic the man in the tiger skin written by a famous georgian poet
shota roustavelli in the 12th century is the devil's castle huh fascinating that was built
yeah it doesn't really say yeah let's see
okay
pulled the map built oh there we go built between uh according to the chronicle named mesuri
metanine which tells the history of the georgian principality of shamashi shabatoga
and the neighboring states between 1561 and 1587 i think i think you want to do detective work
yet ago it says it was built during the time of the you're at you're artians so at the top maybe
yeah there it is time of the you're audience so you know yeah just common knowledge yeah just
google google the herodians figure out when they were when was the time of the herodians
i wonder what the herodians are doing now mentioned in the assyrian sources wow from the
early 13th century bc she's an old what an old one no way that's 13th century bc how old
they say gobekli tepi was oh dude like 12 000 bc 12 000 yeah okay but again it's been renovated
right the last renovations probably medieval medieval ages or something right right but
there's some stories about this place so i was a kid in the candy shop like it was if i go to a
place or visit a people and it's better than i imagine i am so happy because often the photos
you know are like instagram versus reality for a lot of things you know i mean and so i'm there
i'm like exploring i set up my tent we started campfire we i mean me and the devil that lives there
there's no one else there and um and uh so we're there again me and the devil
and uh the sun starts to go down i'm like all right she could find my flashlight and i couldn't
find my flashlight i said i must have dropped it when i was moving my camera gear and stuff around
and the sun was going down and i had a like a torch i always when i go to these places like
to it's like cinematic you bring one of those medieval torches with the fire and so you can
make those pretty easy with kerosene and the old t-shirt and so i i make my little torch and i get
my tripod and my camera and i thought i'd get some cool shots of walking around the castle with
the torch at night and also find my flashlight inside and so i'm going down and uh down the back
steps and i have the the torch and it's great and then i look over and then on the again left hand
side you can set the path and so i was on one of these ramparts here on the left of the castle
and i could see two flashlights like on the on the path and realize that they're that that they
were standing there like looking at me and but that's kind of far away you can't really see too
much detail and i'm like that must be like two local kids or or something and i'm there with my
my torch and then all i hear is yelling like and i was oh and then i didn't know if they're yelling
at me or yelling at each other and then i hear a it was a bullet bullet zipped over my head
and i was like wow what the like no everyone's shooting at me like they must be hunting but
it's like fucking like nine nine p.m like who's shooting like it must be a mistake and so i kind
of like i have my fucking dorky torch i like like a movie like look again and then another bullet
over my head and i realized no they're shooting at me and i hear them yelling again and they start
running along that path on the left towards the little bridge of the castle and i have a literal
watermelon because there's only one way off this place and it's that one bridge that they're going
to get to and i have all my my tents there like what do they what do they want like they are they
gonna like kidnap me this is kind of close to an area that's quite sensitive and people sometimes
there are terrorists and stuff so i was like they they can't be coming for me but like they're
obviously shooting at me specifically like maybe they think i'm i'm like a kid who's graffiti
because there was a little bit of graffiti and i look again and they're very much sprinting towards
to catch me and so i'm like game mode and so i put the torch out and i i'm like there's no way i can
get to my tent i don't know what they want but i don't want to find out and i figured if i if i
sprint i can beat them to the front gate and i can hide on the mountain so i have the torch out
and have my phone i didn't want to turn the flashlight on the phone so i pressed record
on the phone so i could use the dim light from the screen and it wouldn't turn off and i used
that to find my way so they couldn't see where i was as a bonus i have the footage but in the time
and time i'm like like i don't want to put on the flashlight record boom like that and so i was
using that the the screen light to be able to go i also i guess as a bonus it's nice to have the
footage if i'm not dead but but at the same time i'm trying to find my my footing without showing
them where i am and so i'm jumping from rock to rock and i make it down i don't have anything
on it's it's very cold this time of year it's like november and i'm able to get out the front
climb up the side of the cliff and i'm hanging on the side like behind a bush and these two guys
run in and they're like yelling and they're on the top of the the rampart there on the left
and they're looking around and they start shooting into the air and i'm hiding in the in the bush
and they're the flashlight scans by my bush and that's the most terrifying feeling man
i like feeling like you're being hunted by people with guns and you have nowhere to go
you can't move the flashlights on your bush and you you stay still complete freeze response
and the flashlight kept going and they went around to look somewhere else because i can't
escape right they went to go look in the field or something i'm trying to climb back up the the
cliff and get to the path but it's really rough and very steep and i don't i have my phone luckily
and i look at my phone and i have one single bar of reception and i have a local friend who's
three four hours away in the town and so i message my friend suat i'm like suat i'm at the castle
that i told you i was going to people are here they have guns and they're trying to get me what
do i do and he said hey luckily he get back he gets gets back me pretty quick and it's like
they're terrorists they will try to kidnap you and they will steal everything in your tent
try to get away but my car keys were in the tent so where am i gonna go i've even if i was managed
to get back to the path i can't get the keys so i'm there shivering because it's it's november
and it's like 10 p.m or something they're like what do i do what do i do and so i was like suat can you
send the police and he goes yes don't worry i'll definitely send the police you hang tight they
should be there soon and so i'm there shivering and these guys are now realizing i'm not on the
on the little peninsula thing here on on the the rock field so they're starting to spread their
search out and coming back towards just two of them yeah two i think actually there was three
by that time but there was and they have their guns and they fire shots they're yelling and they're
their searches expanding which means i can't really go anywhere else and they'll see me if i come back
so i'm stuck and i'm like i can go up the top of that hill and i can try to sneak out but i'm
gonna die of exposure man it's it's so cold like i have nothing really yeah because it was it was
too cold and so i was like i had to wait here for the police so i'm waiting i'm waiting i'm waiting
and then luckily after like 30 minutes i got a call from my my buddy suat and he goes okay
the police are at your tent it's good now and i'm like i didn't see anybody come like there's
there's not they're not at my tent and he goes no they're like they're at your tent he told me
your tent is red right and i'm like yeah uh okay you're sure and he's like yeah yeah they're at
your tent i'm like what i'm also i have no other options right i can't leave i can't get my keys
their keys are in the tent so my only option is to go back and see if the police are at my tent
even though there was two or three dudes with guns right and so i sheepishly come back luckily find
my flashlight on the path get that and i creep up the back to see who's at my tent and it's the
guys with the guns but they're like mic and i'm like hi and i realized that they were the police
all along and the story came together that when i came in with all my equipment apparently some
locals saw me and thought i was a treasure hunter and that i was trying to steal the secret treasure
of the princess that no one had been able to find at the castle and so the locals reported me for being
a me being a terrorist and treasure hunter called the military police who came in with guns blazing
they saw the the lights were cut they assumed i cut the lights and they just went nuts and so
they're like mic where were you we were looking for you and i was like what the i was like how
many times did you shoot at me and they're like oh like eight times and i was like why did you shoot
and we're trying like we're conversing with google translate basically and they're like why are you
here i'm like i was just like making youtube video and they're like youtube channel i subscribe what
is channel oh my lord and so they're like no dude you can't stay here because there's too many
wolves and bears and they'll eat you alive apparently and so they they literally they brought me back
to my rental car they drove me in my rental car to the local hotel then we smoked cigarettes and drank
uh whatever what's that drink called like a whiskey a local whiskey uh for the night until
like three a.m. and then they left oh my god and everything was that's totally fun oh but like
why it brings up so many questions why would just sneak up on me man like just sneak up and catch me
hey are you stealing the treasure oh no you're a tourist like why shoot so many times why
oh god it was just shoot first and ask questions later yeah that's insane so i didn't end up spending
the night man but that was the most that's the most closest closest you've come to death on
any of your excursions i mean they they wouldn't have shot me i don't think but it was close but i
could have so much i could have they wouldn't have executed you but they easily could have
accidentally shot you or i could have fallen off the cliff climbing right i could have not had any
reception and then fucking i don't know what would happen uh like dude so do you you obviously do
you bring any kind of weapons with you after that happened no i i like i don't know i think especially
if you're by yourself in a remote place imagine imagine the scenario all right so
they see me like they did they shoot i hide they come in with their guns i'm there with a
shitty saying let's go boys yeah it's not gonna work right no so that's it it's like and there's
been a few crazy things happen like that but it's always misunderstandings man it's never
someone actively trying to cause harm there's opportunistic people out there who will break
into your car steal your pickpocket you try to steal your luggage from an airport that's happened
a bunch of times but i've never had anybody come try and cause harm to me in a confrontational way
right except for misunderstandings like this in the most dangerous countries in the world
Turkmenistan Venezuela Pakistan like Mauritania all these places you know right it seems like
in all these crazy places that you can go the most dangerous thing as human beings right
like the show there's deadly animals there's diseases and you know treacherous landscapes but
generally humans are probably the most dangerous thing you're gonna encounter and honestly you
do weird shit you get weird results so yeah no shit so is that all all that stuff you were
talking about you filmed it with your iphone and that's in this video it's all there wow so if you're
on youtube just search solo camping in satan's castle come on horribly wrong and you're gonna
find out everything you just watched that's insane bro so you also you made a video about you made
a couple videos about some shit you did in the Congo yeah and there was some pretty crazy like
rituals that these people would would practice in the Congo what were those about well that was
another situation where it's like do weird shit get weird results because Congo doesn't this is
dent this two congos the big one's called the democratic republic of Congo and the reason why
i went is because i love the jungle i i love it and if you look on a map of the world there's really
three big green patches that are jungle that people don't generally go to central amazon
Papua Papua New Guinea and deep Congo central of Africa and i won the tricongo so i found a local
contact we worked for a month to get a tourist visa for this country again not very common well
tourists do go to Congo but they go to the east where there's the gorillas there's a
really cool volcano you can see there there's tourism that happens in the east but no one
goes to central Congo and so i had to pay like 300 for a tourist visa took us a while to figure it
out the idea was to go to kinshasa the capital do a couple things there big crazy city and then go to
the heart of the jungle so i congo is the most corrupt place i've ever been in my life i land
after doing this whole visa dance paying a lot of money for that and i get to immigration and i'm
like excuse me here's my my my visa and they look at it like okay yeah sure come with me go in the
back room bunch of guys with ak-47s and they're like uh you have to pay your your tourist visa and
i'm like i i have it it's here like no you that's not it you need another one i'm like no i i i
haven't like no no you need another one yeah and so you're like here we go and so you shell out
300 more dollars to get the same piece of paper and then you're in Congo so
what i wanted to film in kinshasa first was there was a couple things number one is there is people
called the sap sappers the society of elegant people and ambience makers these dudes who who
live in complete poverty spend all their money on fancy suits so you have this guy living in a
concrete hole wearing the brightest most bedazzled orange suit with like a top hat and
like alligator shoes and they go up and they perform on the streets they're kind of like a
mime meets uh like a like a catwalk kind of and they block traffic and they dance and it's really
really interesting and also there's something called voodoo wrestling where they have it's like
wwe meets harry potter meets witchcraft whoa so they they set up um a ring in the middle of
like a barrio like a favela kind of and they they fight with magic spells and so they'll be there
and they'll like make someone trip and then they'll pull a snake out of an umbrella and they'll like
stick the snake on the person and it's it's the most crazy thing ever and how that night ended is
there was uh yeah yeah yeah catch congole voodoo wrestling wow was that guy wearing a tutu uh
probably yeah that's amazing if you want to see some funny shit you can go the again all the
stuff's on my youtube channel yeah um but how it ended man is there was a uh a woman named Shakira
who was the champion and she i watched her plunge a machete into a man's chest and eat his intestines
for real
no but it looked real oh that was funny mike
but uh she she really did eat intestines so it's again it's just kind of like wwe i'm sorry if you
believe in in in world wrestling federation but it's it's a little bit fake i see i was one of the
shorts oh no wait why is it why is it like that oh yeah it's a short oh this is a it's a one minute
video but you'll still see them so what do they bring so that's a fart a fart attack their magic
spell bam he catches it has some kind of magic smoke oh that's amazing and there's a bit of like
actual wrestling in there and there you go magic spells boom ouch there um there this is wwe inspired
obviously yeah for sure it is yeah look at the magic sleep umbrella he's putting a wine on them
look at that oh orange juice wow there's this is Shakira on the left boom and then there's
it's it's amazing it's and this is this is it so ah this isn't it isn't in the short yeah so she'd
stick some with it with the machete uh-huh and then she eats the his intestines oh that's beautiful
look at that this is so much more entertaining that's way better than wwe youtube did not like
that one really no no no no it's got age restricted but it's so bizarre how they love people in those
remote parts of the world are so such big wwe fans i met a god i met a uber driver or a taxi
driver in new orleans a few years ago and uh it was during i went there for wrestlemania
and he was telling me a story about when he was a kid when he was like eight years old he was a
grew up in zumbabwa zumbabwa and he said when wrestlemania would come on him and his friends
would walk like 12 hours to where they knew there was a tv and they would go watch wrestlemania
like they would talk about hulk hogan and macho man these guys they were like super obsessed with
this stuff i think probably because it's it's real life superheroes that's what it is right
because you have spider man you got batman but there's no real spider man and batman right
but there is a real hulk hogan and undertaker and they do some pretty they do magical type
shit not as magical as like uh voodoo wrestling but yeah man it's very performative and there's
obviously like you know drama involved in this theater but it's still pretty fucking brutal i mean
hulk hogan's had like 12 back surgeries and like 14 hip replacements they really themselves up
yeah so these guys are doing a more traditional wrestling um but yeah there's a fight i think
right after this one that's that's the guy boom again you're right that like that
hurts that yeah that hurts doing the push-ups man i love the costumes too it's so perfect
hulk hogan his name was ninja oh that's amazing
this is all this one is also is more standard so there's like this catch catch congole which i
think is what this is which is more standard than this like uh catch fetish which is the more magical
spells but we organize like talking about how like this neocolonial list that i hear sometimes
like we organize this whole event so we paid we paid for this entire event for the whole community
really and with that i was able to film inside and everything like that but to be able to yeah
this is a good one yeah and they they like everyone was just there was a whole parade to get there
but it's just so it's so fun to come in and like make a big fun thing and yeah look at all those
people dude and we can all this have fun together yeah you know and with that i can i can get in
the ring i can get the good angles and that that's all good but like just being able to create that
like vibe you know yeah dude that's super that's so bizarre so the the guys in the orange will
start fighting with spells here in a second it's a father and son there is boom
isn't that great it was so fun to watch and then you'll see in a second she she leaves the ring
and she is she is full zombie mode it's like she you can't communicate with her
and then how this video ends um is that after she goes yeah goes to the crowd
my local contact comes to me and says we have to leave now things are going to get bad and so we
just i'm like i don't know what that means but let's get out of here really yeah that's what he told me
yeah so she's i mean she's really eating those things that's wild dude yeah it's just a bit weird
sometimes because uh the stories sound so crazy but like i there's like it's there you know i mean
yeah that's like that's like that you what you find out about in a horror movie or like some sort of
crazy Stephen King novel how often do you go out and do this shit originally what what how youtube
used to work was that you vlog you go you have a camera you record you do your day thing you might
find something interesting and posting often was something that i used to do like it was a point
where i did two a week i think for a this style video no how did you start like vlogging oh really
how i started in the beginning was making these applications for travel competitions there was
this era of like five years where every travel company was trying to make a travel video competition
the first one was the tourism board of somewhere in australia queensland where they it was the first
ever like video best job in the world competition where you could submit a video saying hi i'm so
and so i love to travel and if you won you'd get a the best job ever best job in the world i
forget what it was called and you'd have a job exploring australia for a summer and it got like
hundred thousand applicants or something from around the world and i just coasted on that i
submitted all of these different videos to uh these competitions but then it got into vlogging and
now answering your question huh with this shit yeah with this shit it's like it takes a lot of
planning man um like i told you with with the the congo the congo wrestling it takes it takes a
while to figure that out yeah and with that you can tell a better story and ultimately what i want
to do is tell better stories i want to have the real authentic thing and there is definitely a
point where you can find real authentic stuff and just show up and that's great but not always when
you got a crew like i have a videographer now i've got editors i got all this stuff it's like a lot of
yeah he got to make sure you deliver he can just have a fun trip you know you have to be able to
you get get it to work yeah yeah and continuing that congo story one thing i i've always realized
is some of the best stories that i've ever told are the ones that you could never plan right yes
and so after the voodoo wrestling and seeing Shakira the man eater disembowel a man
um we headed off to the jungle and there was a city called bowende which was as close to the
middle of the green heart of congo as we could go and then from there my local contact a guy named
obed had spoken to people in this town who had told him about this tribe where there was this big
woman matriarch apparently this like six foot seven foot woman obese woman with a bunch of these
little naked males subordinates and it was a tribe and they'd have never seen tourists before
and they had made this decision to allow us to go and some kind of special deal we had done
and so like for me i was like that sounds amazing you know imagine like in the middle
of the congo jungle some giant woman and a bunch of naked males just like carrying her around or
whatever they did but we had no plan like we'd had heard a rumor right and so we ended up going
to this small town in the middle of congo called bowende um landed there there's only one flight
a week arrived to the village and immediately upon arrival we had to deal with all of the
payment bullshit for whatever bullshit they could ever come up with and we had heard the
the governor was informed that we had arrived and we had to see him immediately which is normal
you go to any place in the world that's weird you meet the local tribe leader the local government
you have tell them what they're doing because why why are you here right so we go roll up to this
big kind of flat house in the middle of town walk up the steps enter inside and there's this
giant man sitting on the couch watching tv looking really pissed off and as we walk in he doesn't
even look at us he beckons towards the couch and so me and my guide sit down and then my guide begins
to speak and he interrupts him and he's like why are you here in my village and then my guide begins
to speak again and as he does the governor turns up the television louder as as my guide starts to
explain hi we're here i'm with a foreigner he's canadian he likes filming uh he makes like small
films like television films we're trying to make it relatable to him there's no wi-fi there um and he
and he's he wants to see the jungle and the people here uh around the jungle and he's like
why does he want to come here in my jungle and i start to jump in i'm like well i find that people
here very interesting and i have a biology degree and i love the jungle and he goes well you have
forests and you have people in your country so why come here and i'm like well no it's just
it's different and he goes we are not that different you're a forest in my forest and you are people
of my people and i'm like fuck like we're this is not negotiations aren't going well
and he he starts to explain like he's like listen people come here all the time um most no he's like
listen people come here and they they want to exploit my jungle they want to mine in my ground
they want to cut my trees anybody with white skin is bad and you have to remember that
Congo democratic republic of Congo has a nickname called the heart of darkness
it's called the heart of darkness because around 1900 something uh a guy named king leopold the
second from belgium came down and made this whole rubber operation this man this horrible
son of a bitch killed i think 15 million people in Congo for to exploit the country for rubber
and other resources if they didn't pick rubber fast enough he'd cut off their hands and still
make them keep the same quotas and if they didn't make the quota he'd kill them he killed 15 million
people think of that we're talking early 1900s i think it's like 1890 some yeah until like until
early 1900s and so with that filming in in a lot of these countries in the west that were exploited
so much by colonialism colonialism it's very difficult because everyone thinks a white person
is trying to take advantage of you yeah man it's like that epigenetic trauma exactly and even now
and he was right that he would he would have seen a few foreigners in his life and they would have
been there to illegally log i'm gonna do with the camera i just want to take photos of the jungle
and meet this giant woman with her little little crew and so we're here and he does not trust us
at all and so he's like um he's like there's uh so yeah he doesn't trust it at all and he looks at
my camera because i have my camera on my hip and he goes how do i know that's not a gps device
because he'd never seen a camera like that before and i'm like no it's a camera he goes no how do i
know how do i know it does not give gps so you can send gps to people to to mine in my land
i can't prove to this man what this thing can do he's never seen it before and honestly it
probably does do gps uh if it's a camera you know what i mean and and i we could not convince this
man and at all about anything and so he said okay i will think about it i will consult with my my
committee and i will let you know tomorrow and so we're like and i can't there's no internet there
right so i or not that he had and so i couldn't pull up anything to show him like look i've got a
youtube channel is like how am i going to explain to him i'm not tagging the location of some ancient
hardwood to log so we go back to our little shack of a of a hotel and we sit and then his
security guard comes over late at night like around 9 10 p.m and their power goes out generators go
out people sleep like kind of kind of stuff right so it's weird to see people that late
he comes over and he speaks a bit of english at this point we're speaking in in french mostly
and he explains listen the governor didn't meet with the council he's not going to let you pass
he's going to keep you here and he's he's going to make you leave on the next plane
out because he's not going to let you continue in the jungle next plan it's a week
so we're not going to sit in a in a hotel for a week and so he's like what he's like listen
i was able to find some internet like dial up or something somewhere and i can see like you
do photography
you should tomorrow morning get two local men on motorcycles and leave the city early
before he can catch you to go to the border of of the state and once you're out of the state
then he has no power and so we thank this guy because we would have been trapped otherwise
and so the next morning early we get two local guys on motorbikes we load up supplies because
it's like four days to the next village where we can actually get a get a any kind of civilization
and we head off into the jungle because we would have been trapped there and he wouldn't have
imprisoned us necessarily but we would have been we would have been locked not well we would have
been monitored and not allowed to leave so me obed and two local guys take off on motorbikes
first thing in the morning after eating some plies into the fucking congo on the shitty
little dirt path with a vague idea by asking some people the direction to go to find the next
village outside of the state where we can kind of reassess the plan and so we take off and we're
zipping along we i had trusted my my my guide obed to get us enough food for the way he ended
up getting for four guys two packs of spaghetti a can of sardines and like that was it and so we
eat all that on the first day and there's no more food left and so we were we didn't all our
spaghetti slept on the side of the road with a little little like a local village it wasn't a
try but it was like people living very traditionally and then continue the next day until we find
someone selling an alligator on the side of the road like one that was probably three four feet
and i didn't know why or what but he was there he had an alligator in his hands and he um my my
guide the my driver stops and so there's a four of us stopped by this alligator and my my driver's
like oh like this is dinner and there's a four foot alligator and i'm like this is dinner he goes
yeah yeah we'll eat that tonight and so the guy takes a machete the the guy who has the the alligator
the crocodile whatever it was cracks in the head a few times we tied up to the back of the bike
and we continue so then there's there's like a hilarious video of this overloaded motorcycle
with a dangling alligator in the back as we're going through these dusty roads
there's a congo river one of the most powerful rivers in the world that goes through this part of
part of the country too and apparently we had forgotten it was wet season or something
and it had flooded the path so um i double checked with my driver like what do we do and he goes oh
we can drive through and i don't own a bike i don't have been driven that many bikes i just
assumed that you couldn't drive a motorcycle through water for very long my driver said don't
worry it's fine so we plow through this flooded part of the trail and the bike gets flooded
completely and stops and sunset and we're in the middle of nowhere in the congo jungle
with no motorcycles and a dead alligator dangling off the back is this it yeah yeah
dangling off the back of the motorcycle and so we don't have like uh there we are um we don't
have a tent or any it's insane man it's also beautiful and it's beautifully insane is what it is
yeah so this is like yeah they had tried to build a bridge or something cows in the road
that's my guide we're like what's going on this is our bridge is it gonna hold the bike so we don't
know so this is before it got flooded though yeah and very soon we'll get flooded so we're
continuing this before the alligator as well and uh i think it's probably a crocodile and we
continue and we do have tents sorry and so unless people legally yeah this is it so this is um
people illegally logging yeah oh shit
and it was a chinese guy so logging is not permitted there uh i think that so this is the
road getting flooded now uh it it isn't it isn't it's like you you pay enough money you can do
anything you want so i think people get bribes or whatever it is right bikes get flooded oh my god
dude oh no and um we get stuck
so then what happens is that we yeah so there's this little village see it here
the people walking on the path the whole thing's flooded and we have to make a choice it's like
we can't we're too far from our village to walk the sun setting there's not really any
place to pitch our tent and so we decide to see if we can make peace with the alligator
they're dangling on the bottom well yeah yeah i saw um how can we make peace with this this tribe
and we had the food we had the the crocodile right and so there it is in the bottom
that's amazing and we decided to barter the crocodile for a night in one of their huts
so we in a moment we we show up with a crocodile over our shoulder these people we've never met
before never seen before right here and we're like hi and they don't even speak french because again
people from belgium were french they call colonize this place so french the language you can speak
in kinshasa a lot of places they only speak the local language luckily one of our guides did this
is me trying to like hide the camera behind the crocodile so i'm not running up with them
and just filming right because this is a first these people probably never seen a camera before
they wouldn't but the only people they would have seen would have been probably chinese people
legally logging okay yeah wow and he's like she's like totally she's like who is this white ghost
right now and the first thing they do is they bring over a chair for me a bucket and i can't
communicate and so i'm waiting for my local guide to come and here we negotiate we talk we
exchange the crocodile and uh there they had already eaten i guess for the evening so they
we have the crocodile the next day for breakfast and this night is a really beautiful scene of
of them bringing them having a dance uh singing and and kind of celebrating that we were there
they bring a pangolin over to do a pangolin is i've seen them yeah really really endangered
animal they had caught it they wanted to show me yeah you can see this is them cutting up for
the yeah that thing yeah the pangolin that thing's crazy like it's a pangolin because they're very
endangered it it's dead yeah they had just killed it did y'all eat it uh i didn't see what happened
to it i probably would have went to the family so here i explain that they're very endangered the
chinese grind grind up the scales and they use it for chinese medicine but look at that incredible
creature yeah the the chinese they use a lot of things like a lot of weird pieces of animals
for medicines yeah and like i think they use the they use like the tusks of the elephant for like
viagra yeah like boner pills man i'm like if that works and we sing and we dance and the next morning
we have um we have crocodile for breakfast which was great did the did the bike ever start back up
yeah well actually well the the the two guys i think pushed forward to some point i think loaded
the the bikes onto boats and there was the next morning here we wake up with the crocodile
and then we take boats to the village because you can't get by on on the on the path so we
get in these boats these dugout canoes we load everything up and we go we take most of the
day to get to the next village and then in the next village um we end up sleeping in the tent
it's a it's a different video but i we get there super late and uh we i pitch a tent
and from there what happens i wake up the next morning and there's all these people waiting
outside so here here they're they're fishing in a very weird way so they have like a stick and they
put a a dead fish on the end of the stick and they're trying to get catfish i think and they
oh wow yeah and so it's like an an automatic fishing rod they keep it there all day and then they
but this is something you couldn't plan like this is not part of the plan at all but
make that so wild man make lemonade you know and the sequel the sequel is what i'm showing here
now which is uh hunting with the a tribe in conga where they yeah this is the next video
it's a uh green mamba that attacked us is that poisonous dude it'll kill you in an hour really
yeah and they end we end up eating it which is the next video um but yeah it's so funny the next
day and in the next video is um we camp that night we wake up the next morning and i hear
here like a ruckus outside and so because we arrived late in the dark and i open my tent and
there's like 50 people all gathered around seeing who's inside the tent because they'd never seen
a tent before probably never seen a white guy before and there's a woman there grinding this
some kind of paste from a bark to put on my skin because she knew my white skin wouldn't
handle the the sun and so i wake up and they put the the sunscreen on my face and then we
spend two days hunting in the forest and then one of those days we were out there walking through a
river and all of a sudden like one of the guys freaks out jumps back and this green mamba this
six foot seven foot snake sprints out of a hole on the side and comes right at me and the guy
bangs it on the head with a machete it goes off in the jungle they chase it
and then they catch it and they cut it up but a green mamba like mambas
his black mambas his green mambas they're the most aggressive and one of the most venomous snakes
on the planet they have a neurotoxin so you if that bites you it starts it stops your heart
from beating it stops your diaphragm from moving your lungs like your your dead meat and we're so
remote um it's it's a it's a lethal dose every single time do you uh when you spend like weeks
and months out there in these in these remote places with no technology no cell service do you
get the sense of how other people have described this where like other senses in the body sort of
like open up right like when you're when you're in the jungle around all these insects and all
these beating hearts all around you like what you just described with the mamba jumping out do you
have like a higher sense of perception uh for like defending yourself against other animals or
like your hearing or your vision do you do you notice any anything like that any more like sensory
perception well part of the reason why i like this job is because it makes you aware because if
you're always searching for a story or a or a your look always looking for a shot whether it be a face
or a caterpillar or a cool flower or whatever it is or a monkey in a tree you're always aware when
you're when you're making videos or for photography you know because you're always looking for a cool
thing to shoot and so what amplifies that even more is hanging it with guys like this who are like
oh hey um look the ants are moving that means it's gonna rain in the next hour and then 45 minutes
later it rains because they knew because the ants do this at a certain time ancient knowledge that
we've all lost yeah and like even knowing what the medicines to use what plants counteract other
plants and how there's like a poison ivy and beside a poison ivy there's always some kind of
other plant you can rub on the poison ivy and it's just incredible to be able to do that
yeah everything you need is out there it's incredible it really is yeah
and those those moments are special man um because you're just you're just people doing what people
do and it's it's nice to be able to communicate in charades and just joke around and they're
still doing fart jokes and all kinds of stuff they actually smoked a lot of pot too those guys
yeah yeah they had a homemade bong made out of bamboo and so he smoked a bunch of pot and
you said uh i think you said it on on mark's podcast shout out to mark he's awesome yeah um mark
agnon he you mentioned on his podcast that at all the con i think you said you've been to like 90
something countries right yeah you said that the one thing that you found in common between all
these countries was uh singing dancing and drugs yeah i want some that's interesting singing and
dancing for sure uh which is just storytelling like think about this you are one tribe visiting
another tribe and you don't speak the language how can you communicate who you are where you're
from what your values are what your tribe stands for if you can't communicate you dance and you
sing and you show the the struggles of your people you show your your your recording rituals you
show all of that and so song and dance is is an international language dance especially right
because it doesn't matter where you go if you can express yourself you can communicate right and you
can see someone's intentions about how they dance right if you're their jab and spears or a fear
and so that that language is is international for sure and it's just it's just storytelling
and that's why i think why we still remember at least i still remember the lyrics to britney spears
get me baby one more time not because i wanted to listen to britney spears i was force fed it
for most of my childhood but the human mind is designed to keep information in the form of song
because how it's the most perfect time capsule right a floppy disk out in the hallway there's
like iPods and shit or like hard disks like back there that rust and fall away falls away but a song
and because our brains are made to understand songs and remember songs that's that the perfect
time capsule for information and writes a passage and and what god is and how you should be that's why
we all love music even in the modern world and why we can listen to songs or like marketing
jingles you know and still remember them so long after we've heard them is because our brain's wired
for that yeah yeah there's definitely something magical about it um and so you've said also that
you're a free diver you spent your diver yeah spent a lot of time around the ocean yeah i mean i've
got uh probably close to a thousand scuba dives and um i do a lot of freediving now too yeah
yeah i i uh i started scuba diving i was really young with them i soon got into just i strictly
freedove i love that you got into freediving tell me why you like it i like freediving because there
is a well number one there's way less chance of you getting up with like the bends um it's so
complicated with all the gear i've almost died many times scuba diving because uh i've done a lot
of stuff like filming like filmmaking underwater in like the cayman islands and in the caribbean
and um when you're filming you're focusing on the on getting the shot you're not paying attention
to your gauges right like one time i was diving the cayman wall and i literally the grand cayman
wall which goes from like a hundred feet to like over a thousand feet in like an instant yeah and we
were in a cave or whatever and i sucked my oxygen tank dry a hundred i was a hundred feet down
and i was like grabbing my buddy's fit i almost shot to the surface i almost died my buddy grabbed
me down and gave me his octopus and i started breathing on that but freediving is different
freediving is like you're very you're you got to be way more hyper aware of your surroundings and
when you're doing those long breath holes it's like meditative mm-hmm and when you're done like
after you're done like a like a like an hour of freediving or spearfishing you get this great i
don't know what it's from i don't know if it's from the breath holes or what like chemically
is going on in your head with the oxygen deprivation but you get that this crazy sense of euphoria
after it's super it's super uh meditative i don't know another word to describe it i
dude breath is this underrated thing that we that we have i think it was one of these ancient
things that some cultures began to understand the power of and then we just lost it but if there's
what i preach now is if there's one skill you want to work on to reduce stress be healthier
just feel better in your body breath man because all the time we're always breathing and even
like doing anything nervous like even before this podcast you know it's not my first rodeo but
still like if you feel energy right and if you just breathe into that oh my god you can alchemy
any feeling in your body into into anything right but if you just get caught in that fight
or flight breath doesn't matter if it's asking a girl out or at work or doing something like
skydiving or or some kind of public speaking if you don't control your breath you can don't
control your actions or your emotions yeah 100 man and freediving i i respect you a lot for that
because i would say it's one of the most difficult skills to learn because it puts you
in direct conflict with your fear response it puts your brain against your body against your mind
because when you first learn to hold your breath then that feeling of oh my god i need to breathe
right and how the convulsions start to happen literally of a physical response that's a scary
feeling man and especially if you've never dealt with your panic response before your panic
response will come in because you're essentially suffocating yourself yeah yeah we used to free
dive through these caves these grottoes in cayman where you could like i don't know it wasn't that
deep the bottom was probably maybe 50 feet and uh these caves you could swim in these caves you
could do like these crazy swim throughs right where you could swim through it it would be like
beautiful like sand on the bottom and then just like caverns above you and then you could
see the light shafts right where you could escape and there was one of the last times
i did one of those swim throughs was when me and my buddy were doing it and i went down like maybe
30 seconds after him and i was behind him he found he got to the exit and i was like done
i was like i got to get to the surface and he was going up the exit super slow just like taking
his time and i was like there's no way i can wait for him so i just darted kept going looking for an
exit couldn't find an exit my life's flashing before my eyes i finally find a little light shaft
and bro my my head barely fit through i was like squeezing myself through this hole out of this cave
and i was like scraping my whole torso trying to get out of it dude it was the most terrifying
thing but you know freediving it's it's super dangerous and and people get up shallow water
blackout all the time a lot of people i know a lot of people around here in florida you know we're
surrounded by water so there's a lot of you know spear fishermen and freedivers i hang out with
around here and um yeah it's just like part of life being in florida man yeah yeah yeah my buddy
mani he's been on the podcast before he makes these trident and he uh he freedives and he used to
get gators with these things when he was younger he uh he's some badass florida everglade right there
he still has gators but now he mainly just hunts tilapia but he's killed like boars and stuff with
these tridents and they're like super heavy duty florida is great man there's a lot of really good
wildlife around here we got the everglades we got the atlantic ocean we got the gulf we got the keys
there's a i think florida is shit on too much man every time i've come here i've seen some awesome
shit like one of the coolest things i did is um there's a place called neptune memorial reef
heard of it no off the coast of miami there is a it's not far it's maybe like 10 minutes by boat
there is a underground underground underwater cemetery where if you choose to you can have
your ashes after you're cremated put into concrete and then sunk under the water and so you go into
this like mausoleum type there it is yep whoa yep holy crap yeah yeah how have i not heard of this
yeah and so in this concrete are human ashes and so if you want to be part of the ocean man
you that's you become the reef
yeah it's that's amazing that's really cool it's like yeah big lions and i think most people
you become like a sea star or something something simple okay so they like they'll basically create
like cool looking concrete statues out of your ashes and put them down what's that one what's
that guy with the beard down there steve is that is that an actual person oh yeah that's a statue
wow i was there long i was there probably like 20 i don't know a while ago but that wasn't there
when i was there looks new but i mean the hurricanes wreak some havoc on these things but it's still
there yeah it's a really cool dive site and in places like that right it's a artificial reef
and so like it's full of fish and it's so cool to see the sea creatures the corals grow on it
it's a really really cool dive site yeah oh here's a video what's that you want to look at my video
let's see if i'm even better oh yeah of course you got a video on it have you spent a lot of
time in um like the caribbean or like central central america like around there a little bit
yeah uh like right now i'm living in mexico uh oh yeah obviously yeah and this like the cenotes
there for free diving amazing these freshwater sinkholes dude i can go on forever about how
cool mexico is it's really yeah like people think ah it's like wet t-shirt competitions
i think i think cartel is when i think of mexico back and when the channel was cold to kick the
grind man that was a long time ago look at all this fish what did you say back when the channel
was cold kicking it was used to be called kick the grind oh really yeah i changed it
yeah that's insane it's an awesome place yeah there's um i know a lot of people scuba dive the
area where the uh chicksalube crater was in the yucatan yeah where the the comet that it took
out the dinosaurs is there's some crazy video have you been there uh if i haven't been which
dive you're talking about it's the uh i don't know i've just seen videos of where that crater hit
right in the yucatan where the the comet that took out the dinosaurs there's like these crazy
like underwater caverns it was it was halloween and we made uh jacquermas underwater and wait
it'll just show in a second and then you uh i'm not going to spoil the surprise but you'll see in a
second what we do with the pumpkins uh yeah but uh but that's why the cenotes are there
that's why there's all those freshwater sinkholes is because when right yeah the meteorite hit the
earth killed the dinosaurs swiss cheese the landscape then um all the it's limestone so it's
ancient coral reef we put the glow sticks inside that's sick dude you stayed there after dark
yeah you guys are nuts night dives are terrifying man i did one in the caiman islands
caiman's crazy because they got all the um what's it called what's the word um
what's the bioluminescence yeah that's it's cool yes dude all the glow in the dark little creatures
yeah that's really cool that kind of makes you realize that that uh fact can be stranger than
fiction sometimes like the world's an amazing place we just always go to the same locations you
know yes yes yeah man but yeah scuba diving in mexico's amazing uh the mayan i guess but the
reason why i live in mexico out of all these places is because mexico has probably the coolest
amount of shit per square mile in the world if you get appealed the zenoth there's a trash can
right there um for example dude uh like the mayan cultures super fascinating and there's a lot of
things that people don't realize about the mayans like how badass they are like we've done a lot of
cave exploration there a lot of cenote exploration but you can go down into i guess one cave we went
to it's actually just south of mexico in belize but it's all still you could take mayan and
i had heard a rumor of a crystal skull like indiana jones crystal skull have you heard of the blue
hole in belize yes so really famous dive spot right it's kind of like the cenote thing out in the
water that's beautiful there's a black hole in belize that very few people know about and it's
inland and it's a sinkhole a mountain collapsed boom and made this hole a black hole that goes
deep into the ground and i had heard that in the black hole there was a crystal skull an old mayan
sacrifice from a thousand years ago and they had cut off the head and they put it there and it's
saved ever since and because of the limestone it mineralized into a crystal wow so we did an
expedition like a year ago or something where we went into we had to repel down into the into
this black hole we had to set up a camp sleep there in hammocks in in this sinkhole which is
badass in itself and then the next morning went down this crazy sketchy cliff slope thing into
an underground river walked through the underground river for three hours until there was this kind
of like opening we climbed another slope in the dark and then there was this huge chamber with
cave formations that are a million years old like these giant towers of stalactites and stalactites
and we were poking through there and climbing through these shafts with like crystals and
bats and it was amazing and then true enough now that's the that's the cave going down in
that's the black hole that was so this is from going down to the black hole camping and then
the cave continued off to the side this hiking down the side in a second we find Mayan obsidian
so volcanic glass that they would have used for bloodletting and bloodletting wasn't like oh like
blood brothers let's let's cut your finger like dudes would cut their foreskin with obsidian and
then take a knotted vine and pull the knotted vine through the foreskin to be able to get blood
sacrifices wild right also you do it through your bottom lip and you pull the the knotted or
thorn vine through to get the blood and what do they do with that blood man well at this point
again you don't know the full story but what they would have done most likely is do sacrifices to
the rain god chuck because no one really knows why the Mayans civilization collapse it was one of
the most advanced ever right um they invented zero they had this incredible calendar right um
that the world was supposed to end but it didn't but that's like a misconception anyway but um they
think it's because of drought and so this is near the end of the Mayan empire where the drought most
likely was ravishing the country famine because they couldn't grow crops and they were doing
sacrifices blood sacrifices and then this is one of the human sacrificial spots all those are
stalactites made by dripping and dripping and dripping and how can you tell it's a sacrificial
spot because there's bones oh shit yeah pop the first like that's chuck there the Mayan god of
rain so they would do these sacrifices in hopes to bring to appease the rain gods to bring rain
and these towers you see they they grow like a millimeter a year and so some of them are like
stories and stories tall um that's and so we're putting ourselves through here here you we find
another skull um down there it was a child again and see how its heads really strange yeah what the
hell so alien what it would have been flattened so what Mayans did with their children is they would
they would tape a or they would put a reed or a rope around the forehead of a child with a
board and they'd flatten the skull and so the head would become almost like a cone head this is kind
of halfway in between but they believe people came from corn so they'd shape baby's skulls with
boards to make their heads look like corn so the whole skull would be shaped like a cone head
really crazy right and so we climb up the shaft
which is like very claustrophobic yeah that looks that's not a place i'd be wanting to go yeah
and the interesting thing too is like you don't like how did they get here like we've got all of
this climbing equipment to repel down we've got head torch head lamps all this modern equipment
they would have had a torch maybe they would have carried a victim down there there's the skull
cut off the head of most likely a virgin a thousand years ago placed there and never touched
crystallized like like the rock there it is whoa dude that's wild yeah
yeah literally a crystal skull and it's been there ever since
shout out to a place called ean anderson's adventure lodge where they have
they have you can if you wanted to go if you wanted to go to the black hole you could you
can go check out their their facility there oh really yeah not this is kind of like a secret
i mean obviously the secret is a bit out but you can go speak to them and it's a thing people
can do if i mean i don't want to say that too much because it's it's very difficult to be able to get
there but uh if you're if you're fit enough and if if it's still there like part of the the curse
of this job is like you uncover something and anything can happen right but look at that thing
man so that's bizarre so imagine this let's just put ourselves back there for a second you have these
mayan warriors with shaved teeth because they used to shave their teeth the points
they used to embed jewels into their teeth too so you have these like cone head guys with sharp
teeth with jewels embedded going down probably fucked off psilocybin or some kind of hallucinogenic
they had these strange things i forgot their call but it's like a butt trumpet where they would
they would they would put things into their butt so they would do hallucinogenics most likely
through the rectum they think most of the time and they'd bring down these people who were
probably also tripping they could have been how do we know they did it like that because there's
still a lot of imagery like there's like codices like codex that they're still you can still see
them so there's still images of what they used to do that you can see i mean not like cave paintings
but the some of the old books are still exist and they would have cut off a head from somebody
who was also probably tripping right and then leave it there and then thousand years later you
got a crystal skull man and the one really interesting thing happened around my life then
is i i had my first really powerful ayahuasca trip shortly after that a few weeks after that
and i took way too much where in mexico there was a shaman that had come up from peru who had a
particularly potent kind of ayahuasca called sky ayahuasca sky ayahuasca and my i've got a guy a
good friend of mine named arturo in mexico and it was one of his contacts that he had worked
with many times with a lot of different things medicines and so i had this rare opportunity
to work with this this shaman who had this crazy ayahuasca and i i'm mr. fearless and far bro you
know like yeah i've looked under these your fears exactly i've looked under the under the bed i've
seen the monsters i've i've tackled my fear of public speaking of heights of all this shit so
i'm like i know i know my childhood wounds so i thought um and didn't think there was too much
that could make me have a bad trip and i've been able to talk myself out of other bad trips i've
had before too so i went in arrogant man that's not a good spot to be in with hallucinogenics so
do you want the abbreviated story the long story the long story all right we got time all right
so basically we go to this spot in the jungle in mexico there's a group of 15 of us or so
and um son of set we're sitting around a circle we have a shaman there and he's pouring this ayahuasca
it's in a little shot glass like an ounce probably like two ounces and he's got a candle in the middle
and a bunch of people that i haven't met just randoms from all over mexico and it was so so
interesting he cracks open this this bottle that he has ayahuasca and he starts saying a prayer to
it so he blows on it and says some prayers immediately the wind kicks up and i'm like what the
like i travel the world trying to find ghosts and demons and unicorns and devils and like i'm so
down for that but i have a bit of a scientific mind so i want to see proof i can't explain that
coincidence maybe but seems like a little bit too much of a coincidence and he blows on it the
wind picks up he doesn't even bat an eye it's like that's what normally happens apparently i don't
know he reaches over his candle starts pouring it in the glasses it looks like a giant tarantula the
the silhouette of his hand on on the ceiling of this of this yurt and he pours everyone a glass
and so i i take my shot and everyone goes around it tastes like the clippings from under a lawn
mower like gasoline and like plants and almost like you scraped it from the bottom and then the
funny thing about these ceremonies is that they happen in the dark right if you've done psilocybin
before acid whatever it is like generally it's in the day right um and if it's like if you have
mushrooms for example you can go to a dark place but you can kind of change the channel by focusing
on something else and ayahuasca you're in the dark essentially by yourself the whole time there's
people around but you're it's not a shared experience it's a very much individual experience
so he blows out the candle and it's dark 20 minutes goes by nothing 25 minutes nothing
both 30 minutes i'm not seeing anything but i hear this like like the most ominous like i'm going
to vomit my guts out burp i've ever heard and that's a very common thing so all of a sudden
people start popping off and it's like puking everywhere and then they they have instruments
and they're like yeah the medicine is good let it in relax and they're singing songs in Spanish
in different languages and i'm there like well i'm not feeling anything right so i'm sitting and
i'm sitting and i'm sitting and then about another 20 minutes goes by he flicks on the candle again
and it's like a zombie apocalypse it's someone like one guy standing up looking at the sky people
in like puke laying on the ground and i'm like i'm not feeling anything and there's me and one
other guy who are just looking like shit you know we missed the experience the shaman invites us up
for more so we go and take a second shot me and this guy candle goes back out
sit there and then i start to see some visuals so and those feelings kind of bubbling up
joy fear all these things but like breathing through always breathing right breathing through
these feelings and i'm feeling like i'm starting to figure out what what it's like and i'm feeling
a bit comfortable and so i'm like i really got a piss so i'm going to go up and at this point you
could have as much as you wanted i'm going to take my third shot and i'm going to go take a piss
outside and i'm going to come back and just settle in my cocoon so i go up take my third shot
wander out the the door and into the jungle and i start taking a piss and then like the visuals
are starting to happen i see like mandalas patterns like zigzags purple orange colors like that i'm
like all right i got a piss but like now it's starting to kick in and i'm like no piss is coming
out so i'm there i'm like like let's go let's go let's go and then i'm like i got a puke and so i
take a knee and i puke and i puke and i puke and i get up and i have no idea where the i am anymore
just lost in patterns i look around i can't see the front door anymore i'm like oh and so i i
know like i went this way and i see like a black thing i assumes the door i walk towards it it's
just patterns and i i can't make it at the pattern goes away i close my eyes and it looks the same
i open my eyes i think i can't open my eyes but the reality is i can't tell anymore and i look down
and i see this pile of like wriggling leaves or snakes or something and i'm like that's probably
not snakes and i just lay down and i have a little blanket and i lay there like a little
toddler with my little bum bum out of my blanket just like because i'm not i'm out in the jungle
and i'm there and i'm having this like my heart starts racing racing racing and it's patterns
but i can still kind of like cling on to reality and then my world starts to rumble and everything
starts to like shake in my vision and i feel like the world these patterns just start like ripping
open like like this and i feel this absolutely all encompassing panic fear doesn't even do the
word justice like terror like pure primordial pawn scum creationary terror of just i am now lost
i am on a speeding train holding on by a pinky i have no idea what the where this train's going
and with the opening of the world i'm there and i feel this presence of something but this something
is can see everything like see through me and everything every cell in my body can see inside
and i feel like i'm it's almost like this feeling of let's say the whole world was watching you
shit or something like this this feeling of being so vulnerable like the everything can see you
this violated nothing you can like a violating intention a violating view of your entire everything
you've done everything that's that's been it sees everything and then as my heart's pounding and
racing and pounding and racing i feel like what it's doing is it's showing me what the world is
what what the universe is that it's that what i'm seeing this white light and these patterns
exploding everywhere like this is what the the the universe is made of and the terror is coming
from that this thing is showing me the minutiae of of existence and i have no idea what the
fuck i'm looking at it's like an earthworm being shown the schematics of a rocket ship
the earthworm can't even understand what the paper is let alone how to fucking get the space
like i have no idea and so in that i feel like my heart's like starting to be right now because
i'm like i'm going back there but in all of that it's like this this this presence is like oh so
you wanted to see behind the curtain eh like this is what you wanted to do have a fucking look you
know like this this is everything you can't even begin to understand this you insignificant moat
you are an atom in a grain of sand on an infinite beach you don't even have the right to look but
here it is congratulations you got what you wanted and it was horrifying the same way if if you've
never seen inside a human body and someone just tore open a human body in front of you you'd be
like what the fuck but you have to admit it's a little bit fascinating like your your bloody
heart pumping your intestines like the lungs be like it's it's an amazing creation these these
meat suits we have but it was that kind of feeling where you just you wouldn't even know how it worked
you know like you don't no idea what i what i saw and with that i i was having like panic
attack after panic attack and having to like breathe breathe through and breathe through and
luckily the shaman was very good at what he did and he he said in the beginning the more you fight
it the more it'll fight back right and so again went back to the breath no matter how much you're
panicking no matter what's happening in your life if you can breathe out of these feelings that's
all i had i didn't even know where i was anymore so just with the breathing with the breathing with
the breathing remembering every trip has an end every trip has an end i was there eyes open or
closed you know i couldn't tell you don't even know that was the scariest part because i didn't know
where i was lost in the abyss so i'm there with my little booty hanging out of my
blankie and i remember saying it's okay baby it's okay baby it's every trip has an end every
trip has an end baby it's okay and then slow i don't know how long i was there for generally an
ayahuasca trip is four four or five hours something i don't know um if you have like multiple then
it's longer but generally it's all said and done in about six hours so i was there for maybe an hour
or two and then once i could crawl again i crawled back inside and and snuck up into my little
you have a little like pad there and spent the night
but i yeah i felt for a long time how long does that like super intense feeling of the universe
being ripped open how long does that last i again i can't you can't tell but judging by
the time where i could i could come back to reality i would guess i was probably there for
like an hour but after that it's somewhat manageable then yeah then a general a general
ayahuasca experience you would you would be able to mostly control yourself like
that i had a lot if you have like a heroic dose you kind of lose yourself but if you were
going to go have one shot or two even you wouldn't lose track of reality
generally depending on your body and your intolerance but do that that's coming up for
months really yeah oh how so i missed one important thing there what started this story
with the skull is in the presence of that god is what it was i felt that i was so insignificant
that the only thing i could ever possibly do with my life is just give myself to this thing
i have no other gift to give can't give money can't give any possessions the only gift i can give
as a human being to whatever that was was my life and then i got how human sacrifice could
be a thing because what we looked at the crystal skull those people all would have been on some
high-level hallucinogens so if you're meeting god and you do feel like you have to help your entire
culture your people your your my and brothers whatever you could sacrifice and not in like a
suicidal sort of way but like in a self-righteous like i the only gift i can give is is my life
and it would kind of me a little bit because once you see that you can't
and once you feel that even you can't unfeel that like what was that does it exist this is
the question about psychedelics that i always want to know does that always exist or is our
brain just painting it on right yeah that's a good question is that something that's always
there and that just like our brains are filters that are filtering out that world so we can survive
and eat and reproduce and and when we take these psychedelics it maybe breaks that filter so we
can see what's really here are our perceptions our smell our sight is that just a filter
who it will never know it felt real but will never know i consider myself agnostic before that
and it took me this is about a year and a half ago when that happened and i've been slowly realizing
that like there's probably something else and i probably saw it and i can reject it and i can feel
i can feel
i guess i i think i have a bit of shame in the sense that i guess i've been painted with this
idea that like christianity the religion i grew up with is bad and it's like shallow minded and
it's not it's not something that i want to be into right most people you see are like devout
christians aren't painted always in the best light i guess sometimes in culture right or
there seem to be like they don't understand the world but i'm starting to believe that
after again visiting all these tribes and seeing how every culture has a spiritual practice
how man needs some purpose some reason why we're here that if you don't have a relationship with
whatever that was it's a very lonely existence because you see all these people in prison who
they get into god and they become religious because you're alone but if you have belief
that there is a higher power out there it could be nature it could be the universe it could be god
then you're never alone and you can give you hope to get through the day and if you are depressed or
suicidal and you think no one cares someone cares right and i've begun to understand that
maybe man should have a relationship with god whatever that is a relationship with again i
feel god is so has so much pre like cultural bull attached to it but just a relationship with
the universe yeah right that everything happens for a reason that there's always a lesson to be
learned that while there might be some giant challenges thrown at you they're there for a
reason if you choose to live that way and if you choose to believe that everything happens for a
reason it does it does it will because you'll find the reason so it took a long time to digest that
man and even now i still have these like almost like flashbacks of just like a glitch in the matrix
where it's like not in like a psychotic sort of way but just in a like what is this reality
sort of way and one thing that's really interesting too is ever since that my relationship with fear
has has changed like the name of the channel Fearless and Far comes from the idea that fearlessness
is a choice you make and not some state of enlightenment like no one everyone can be
fearless if you choose to walk into your fears it's not not feeling fear it's feeling fear and
and doing it anyway so that's the idea of fearlessness so i wouldn't say i'm sorry i would say i'm
fearless but i still feel a lot of fear and ever since having that relationship with whatever that
thing was and then realizing that fear can be fear can be alchemized that energy is something
that can show up in your body energy is the motion and how that can be changed too and having a bad
trip is just you having energy inside your body and you filing it in the wrong filing cabinet
that if you are on a roller coaster and you feel your heart racing and your blood pumping
and you're excited that's not that different from fear and if you start thinking about fear
that way where i'm not like instead of being like oh fuck i'm so scared for the presentation
tomorrow and you to say i'm so excited for the presentation tomorrow your brain kind of goes
because physiologically they're very similar right and in those moments you can change those
feelings and so even to the point where i got back from that that crazy ayahuasca trip and i got
speaking about weed i'm back to canada where weed's legal and after smoking bushweed with these
tribes i went back and took like bushweed tokes of like shit from and i got so high man and i laid
there and i was having a bad trip and i i just watched it like i was like huh like i feel really
afraid right now huh that's a really weird thing but like what's the difference how how is this
excited is is it fear or is it excitement and then being able in that moment of being like a little
bit off my rocker to feel a feeling in my body and be like why isn't this excitement
and then being like maybe it is excitement and then all of a sudden the fear going poop
over to excitement and then changing it and ayahuasca too throwing up is something that's
very common and when i was going to throw up i thought i was having smiling attacks where i was
going but i was dry heaving but i was like wow i'm smiling so hard right now and then at the same
time i thought i was hungry but again nausea and hunger aren't they're in the same spectrum right
and so just the power of the mind to kind of change feelings is really interesting yeah really
interesting stuff i feel like fear is really important right like fear not but you have to
like you said you to approach it right you can't run from it you should you should lean into fear
because that what that's what makes life worth living dude a man should live on live on his edge
yeah and i think you and i both probably respect people most who can live on their edge
because they they aren't afraid of fear most people are afraid of fear and so
when you get in a situation that causes fear fear comes up and then you're afraid of the
feeling of fear and then all of a sudden you're a tire on fire rolling down a hill and you can't
you can't stop it you're powerless you panic and then in panic you can't survive right right
right mic that is a beautiful way to end this podcast man that was a solid three hour damn
journey through the ether i appreciate you coming down here and telling these stories brother always
go by so fast man fucking amazing um tell people where they can find your stuff i'll obviously link
it all below yeah and then also um do you have any like any trips planned or any new shoots you're
going on yeah just go back from venezuela which was a really good one there went to the amazon did
a couple of the few things and uh but it's all in fearless and far the youtube channel now
yeah there it is we are now we're doing something really fun and interesting so with this idea of
fearlessness and travel and overcoming limiting beliefs and how fear does control your life we're
doing group trips now there's a adventure retreat called tribal rights that we do in mexico we're
doing two more this fall we did one earlier this year 22 people from the states around the world
came many had never traveled before we showed up we actually did ayahuasca we also did sweat lodges
we did ice baths we did a lot of tribal stuff that i've picked up from around the world you
go to trips oh wow that's sick dude yeah and so i mean i've learned a lot of lessons right and a
lot of misadventures but now we've got this retreat so if you want to have the lessons of a
life well lived but uh don't want to go get shot out at satan's castle
you can come to tribal rights and we'll do a lot of the similar stuff yeah hell yeah man
yep i'll link it all below for everyone and uh thanks again bro man thank you this has been
an amazing an amazing conversation thanks for having me man cool all right goodbye world
