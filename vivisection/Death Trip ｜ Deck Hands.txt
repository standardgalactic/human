Shay, what are you doing?
Huh?
Walk out of the room, Shay!
Turn on the lights, Shay!
Fuck it, come on!
Nobody cares, Shay!
No, no, no, no, no!
Holy Desert, Bill.
Compared to what?
When I was on fucking my little fucking boat there.
It was time out.
Took some sex-sex-sex fuckers and fuckers.
Yeah.
Welcome to the gates of Hell.
Now we gone to Hell.
Look at this shit.
Freeeeeeee!
Yeah, fucking nothing. Follow me, fuckers.
Bingo! Oh yeah, fuck it, that's a B20, that's a fucking bingo, fucker.
If you put a piece of ham on a burger, wouldn't you call that a hamburger?
Son of a bitch, it's just, fuck it, fuck it.
I went out fishing finally after fucking eight months.
I went out fishing and I come back and find out that my brother was dead.
Fuck it, last month my dad passed away and I got my ass beat by some Africans.
And then when I fucking got my face thrown in with a beer bottle,
somebody else stole my fucking backpack and I couldn't make it to fucking my dad's funeral because I didn't have no ID.
And they know who they are and then the person that fucking took my backpack
actually was supposed to bring me two bottles of some rummy-dummy, fuck it, just...
And I find out space died and that would have cured me through my whole ride home.
I thought he died of Asian porn.
Yup, I think you had a fucking copped a nut and fucking just fucking died.
Finally an Asian porn, fuck yeah.
I think that's the way you die, fuck it, I'm hoping so.
Fuck it, just blew a nut right on an Asian fucking, get her done or fuck it, just fuck it at heart attack.
Fuck yeah, so fuck it, dad, fuck it, done.
I love you brother space, whatever happened, happened.
Fuck this, I'm coming in to get you.
I'm coming in to get you.
Trying to find some treasures, but back where I live here.
So I did a little piece of this little square thing today and fucking...
I am tripping my balls off.
What's a square thing?
Fucking LSD, fuck it.
You took a fucking hit of acid?
Yeah.
Went today?
Well, I had to, fucking.
You had to.
Okay, this is all fucked up everybody.
I don't fuck up.
Fuck it, I'm not digging.
I am tripping, this is so fucking cool.
We carted so much right here.
Am I crazier as the rest of the world fucked up?
I just really don't know the answer to this situation.
The world's fucked up.
I'm perfectly normal.
What do you think guys?
This is great.
Fuck yeah.
My best friend in the whole wide world.
Space does left me and I'm fucking, I'm gonna miss him the most.
In the whole wide world.
That was my best buddy.
I'm missing space, but you're already fucking...
I don't even know what to say about this.
I love you, Spacey.
Attack on the secret house!
You're fucking out.
Do I seem crazy?
Do I seem crazy?
Don't fuck her.
Fuck you.
Suck my dick right here.
Give me the goddamn shorts.
Right there.
Fuck no.
We'll go up for a cheeseburger.
This dick.
For one thin dime.
Yeah.
Do we get a fuck yeah?
Fuck yeah.
One more time, motherfucker.
Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah.
That's the way we go.
Love you long time, brother.
Never forget.

Always been a fun, fun person to be around.

I've just admired him all my life, as long as I know him.
Not all my, you know, I really admired him.
You're all comfortable.
Don't tell nobody that.
Nah, too.
He's a good brother out on the water.
Took care of his friends, and put them ahead of himself
most of the time.
I met him 19 years ago, before my first trip.
He was like one of the first 10 people I've met
when I first got down here, which I was.
Mommy!
And I left for a little bit, two years, after I got an ICU.
And I came back, and he was one of the first people
to recognize who I was.
Really?
Yep.
Wearing a mask and a sleeve, so you knew automatically
who I was.
Well, we ain't talking about you.
We're talking about space.
He's a good brother to me.
He didn't party for a while.
You know what I mean?
If you needed something, he was there for you.
Yeah.
He gave me 40 fucking dollars.
Yeah, he gave me a 20 here, kid.
Go get yourself a cart and pull out another 20.
Hey, he's just a beard to go with it.
You know?
That's the kind of man he was.
I'd do anything for that man, just like he would for me.
Man, he's damn sure going to be missed.
I've been here 30 years fishing, and I'm in space for 28.
He's always been a little crazy, but he's given me a shirt off his back.
Every damage got in his pocket, and he wouldn't ask you for nothing back.
If you try to give it back to him, he wouldn't tell you.
Do anything in the world for you.
You know?
He's just Scott.
We all going to miss him.
We all love him.
He's one of my closest friends.
I don't got too many friends here.
One of the people I know the longest.
You know?
So, yeah, he's good people, man.
It's funny because I have a son that's fixing to be 13.
I have a son that's fixing to be 13.
How did you know space?
From when I moved to the beach eight years ago.
Really?
And I used to work at Scree Louise, and I have a son that's fixing to be 13.
So my son was four, almost five when he moved here.
And space and Shane Lee have always been really good to my son.
Found this memory.
Catching an ashtray on fire and jumping hot wheels, cars over the fire.
And I come back and I'm like, what are you guys doing to my child?
He had the best time.
And now that my son's almost 13, the last three years, he's been able to ride his bike on the beach.
And he'll come home and he'll go, oh, I just sat there and talked to space for about 15 minutes.
And I'm like, was he okay?
And he's like, yeah, he was all good.
True free spirit.
You can see it in his eyes.
He's a good person.
I didn't think to bring a torch.
There we go.
There we go.
There we go.
But by space free.
That's good.
Fucker, I was supposed to die before you.
I miss you, space.
That was my son and Carol.
God damn it.
Fuck that.
God damn you, space.
He's got a car in the way, so I don't know if I hear him.
He's got a car in the way, so I don't know if I hear him.
Scott Yancey, Stacey, because of you dying, I have lost a part of me that I never had in front of anybody else in front of my whole life.
I've lost you, Stacey, my best friend, and I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever in my life forget you.
My best friends, Scott Yancey, Stacey.
Fuck your head.
