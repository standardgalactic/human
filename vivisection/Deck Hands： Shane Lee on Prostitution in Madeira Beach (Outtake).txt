I'm fighting all the crap inside, starting a new day.
I just dropped my jaw.
I'm fighting a new day.
Breathing in the morning,
got to feel it in the sky.
Say, lolll, lolll, lolll, lolll, lolll, lolll.
Day, yeah.
Fuck yeah.
They take the fucking whores away.
Who does?
The coppers.
They fucking taking them hookers
and fucking not bringing us new ones.
If you're gonna take one, bring back,
You know, the old one knew it.
Yeah, fucking, just sighing.
I had prostitution flashcards.
Know their names?
Okay, yeah, they're all under arrest, they're gone now.
