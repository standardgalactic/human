Tonight, we came out to Hogan's Beach in Tampa to try to hang out with some Skrillex fans.
Anybody with a table or cabana reservation, anybody.
And while you're looking for that, don't forget Halloween night.
Vanilla ice is here.
But yeah, we're about to walk in this joint and see if we can have a little fun.
Let's get the fuck in here.
To get a better understanding of the dubstep kingpin, we had to dig deep.
Oh my god, I can't wait to fucking get in.
You're ready to go bananas, huh?
Oh yeah.
How's your life been since you've had Skrillex in it?
Amazing.
Yes, yes?
Amazing.
Who do you like better, base, neck, or Skrillex?
Skrillex.
Yeah?
Fuck yeah.
He's Dubstep's Elvis, because he's bringing it to the mainstream culture.
He's amazing.
Okay, do you see half of my hair is pulled back and half of my hair is flipped?
All right.
So what's your life like before Skrillex?
Boring.
Boring.
So what does Skrillex mean to you?
I hate Skrillex, but I'm going because there's bitches.
You're going to find some ladies?
Yeah.
All right.
Shit like that.
It turns me up, man.
You drink, smoke, whatever you want to do.
What do you think about anyone as a Skrillex hater?
Fuck him.
What sort of emotional connection do you have with Mr. Skrillex?
That's the man.
That's the man, huh?
Do you think he's hot?
Yeah.
What does Skrillex mean to you?
His genre is like metal of the EDM world.
If anybody doesn't like it, tell them to suck it.
You can ride around with your middle finger hanging out the window.
I don't drive, man.
I ride.
Even after hearing all of his positive fan reviews, I was still a Skrillex skeptic.
I had no choice but to witness his live performance myself.
What I expected to be a seizure inducing spectacle was actually pretty fun.
His fidgety turbocharged disco noises weren't that bad, and the visual production was pretty on point.
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.
