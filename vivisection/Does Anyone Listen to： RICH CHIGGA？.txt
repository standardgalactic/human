Hi, my name is Brandon Bowen. Sadly Rich Chigga denied answering any of my 203 emails I sent him, so I can't interview him tonight.
So instead, I'm going to interview his fans. Hopefully they're not weird.
Hi, my name is Brandon Bowen. I'm here finding out who listens to Tyler the Rich Chigga.
Hi, I'm Lindsey.
What does it mean to be a Rich Chigga fan?
Chigga is whatever you want it to be. It's a way of life.
He's fucking hot. If I was gay, I would totally bang him.
I don't know, I feel like he's so special in his audience. It's such a small niche of fans.
So to be a fan, it's like, I don't know, like the rap side, the K-pop almost, even though he's not Korean, I know that.
Look, here's the thing. I'm a straight man, but Rich Chigga does something to me, is all I'm going to say.
I want to make him uncomfortable, but he's got something going for him, and that's all I'm going to say.
I'm an aspiring artist. I'm not saying to add me on SoundCloud, but add me on SoundCloud.
Cut that out.
Yeah, you're right, you're right. Yeah, we are.
His music does not just, like, hit you with the vibes. It hits you with everything, right?
It fills all kind of emotions. You know, it gets you with the bangers, it gets you with that song, glow like that.
What was your life like before Rich Chigga?
Before Rich Chigga. I don't know. I listen to a lot of, like, K-pop.
What was your life like before Rich Chigga?
Probably a little better.
What makes you think that? What about Rich Chigga to grade your life?
What's up, guys?
Gang gang.
Um, he's trash.
If he was standing here right now, what would you say or do to him?
Sup, Ryan? Sup, Ryan? Let's make Rich Kid, baby.
I'm fucking lit, man. I don't even know what's happening right now. I'm so fucking lit.
You got here at 18 fucking hundred hours of fucking drinking.
Hell yeah. I'm a little two-turn right now.
Rich Chigga or Matt Ox?
Rich Chigga. I don't know the fuck Matt Ox is.
You were just crapping on Rich Chigga. What would you say to a Rich Chigga hater?
So what would you say to yourself?
Suck my dick from the back.
Fuck you.
I kill him.
Fuck you.
Wow, you guys are violent. Do you think he's hot?
Hell yeah.
Rich Chigga.
He looks like my little brother.
So you think your little brother's hot? Is that what you're saying?
My little brother is very handsome.
What sort of emotional connection do you have to his music?
When Glow Like That came out it reminded me of my experiences with women.
So none.
Rich Chigga or Matt Ox?
Who's Matt Ox?
Yeah.
Wow, you guys need to get on Twitter, man.
I'm sorry.
Rich Chigga. Matt Ox is like the fidget spinner dude, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Rich Chigga.
The fidget spinners are fucking lit.
Hey guys, so right now we have Rich Chigga performing in the background.
I can't really talk to him right now.
You can't really understand the word like he's rapping right now because it's so loud.
But you know what? From what I see he's doing a great job.
And I bet if I wanted to go in there, I could.
I'm just going to stay out here and watch.
What does it mean to be a Rich Chigga fan?
I'm a loser.
You're a loser.
You look like one.
Smell like one.
Excuse me?
Sorry, what?
Hey guys, that's the end of the video.
I'm so glad you watched it.
And if you didn't watch it, then you wouldn't be able to see this guy's beautiful face.
And your loss.
Hit me up.
Focus Point YouTube.
I make dumb videos.
Thank you very much.
And also hit his DMs.
He's very lonely.
He's single and ready to mingle.
