It's a true you guys are now living in the true crime clout house where we're we're
sharing a studio but he's got his own place yeah yeah I wish you guys lived
together it could be the true crime clout house the con house yeah we gotta
wait for Matthew to get off probation are you off probation hell yeah
really he's never completed that makes it out pretty clean right that makes it
sound like he completed it and he did a good job and they let him go that's not
what happened at all I they continually violated him put him in prison until
eventually the judge said you're unsupervised superviseable yeah I've
never successfully completed one term of probation my entire life and I've been
on probation since I was 13 years old never successfully completed so I get
out of prison and I got out of the halfway house and I go right back to
fucking making cards you know I mean I said fuck it you know I mean I go right
back to it yeah they got me sent me back to prison and then I got in front of
the judge and she was like you're not superviseable you know we've had to
extradite you from you know every corner of the country to get you back here to
get you get you in front of the judge so it's like they killed my paper they
just gave me time served and killed my paper I had three years of federal
probation but they just squashed it what's amazing I got lucky some people get
really lucky out the door these little technicalities yeah yeah it's not a
technicality he still ended up in like what usually what they do is it's
usually a third so let's say you have three years paper and right away you
end up getting you violate let's say the first month and they'll say okay look
we're gonna send have you do a year's worth of prison time and just quash your
paper mm-hmm by the time he got in front of the judge he'd already done how many
months in prison six or nine months six or nine months so nine months it's like
okay well you don't have that much like if we divide that into you know what
you've what you currently have to serve like you know what just just just cut
him loose because otherwise what do you do start his paper over again like it
just you can have these guys they kept doing that then a lot of the guys would
never get off probation I just had this guy on here who's apparently like one
of the biggest cyber criminals in history in the US history and he did a
lot of the fake card and card stuff too and he's like a lot like what you said a
lot of people that he worked with making fake cards were based in the Ukraine in
Russia why is that if for whatever reason they're bad people Eastern Eastern
Ukraine Eastern Ukraine in Russia is just the the the climate out there you
get you know a lot of those kids out there that's just what they do a lot of
hacking it's like popular culture where they come from isn't it legal there well
but you can also run the forum there like you're not gonna be able to run a
forum here without them cracking down on you they had the servers and everything
over there too right like Carter doubt SU where was that located that was a
Russian server right but you know they're so they're so goddamn smart over
there and tech savvy like your average teenager in Russia knows how to code you
know what I mean like you're just your average teenager over there can code and
they can program and they can you know do all kinds of shit you know your average
teenager here doesn't know dick about coding you know so who are the guy how
are you talking to these guys that were in Ukraine and Russia when you were
doing the carding shit what were you buying from them right so I was I was
purchasing I was actually selling to them oh yeah I was like you're buying
blanks no I wait initially I was okay initially I was buying the blank cards
but then I got into I was actually selling them oh shit yeah yeah and how
are you selling it to them you're selling it you were like how would the
transaction go through it was either Bitcoin or we had like I had Western
Union services set up I had all kinds of shit web monies back then was pretty
popular Liberty Reserve back then was pretty popular and these were like these
fly-by-night online payment systems kind of similar to what PayPal is yeah you
know what I mean like you put $50 in you get $50 and WMZ and like say you have an
account and I have a wallet and we can exchange WMZ between each other but then
there needs to be like a third-party exchanger to cash out of WMZ Intel
whatever currency did your silk road it didn't exist back then oh didn't exist
no the silk road didn't exist the dark web didn't exist the onion router wasn't
even a thing no tour no tour no none of that yeah wow yeah it was just it was
just you know VPNs and you had Russian VPN services that were you know you could
change you get all these plugins where you could change socks proxies and you
know you could change your VPN change your IP address and then go to the the
forums and that's when you know all the forums got shut down but that's when in
the heyday there was a bunch of them there was like 10 or 15 that were just
like killing it no shit yeah the one guy was on just Lex Friedman I don't that
guy he was in here yesterday really had money on Johnson yeah yeah but Johnson
yeah he was he was he was shadow crew man he started shadow crew yeah he started
shadow crew which eventually went on to be Carter dot was it Carter dot SU was
the one I was on but then there's previous to that there was something
called a Carter planet and then there was Carter dot org but he was the godfather
of all of that shit like he started it and then when he when max what were the
guys names from Kagan butler max butler and Christopher Aragon when those guys
went down it created like a vacuum in the in the in the in the in the in the
online space in them in the marketplace because there was you know there was
nobody else making cards because the the feds had taken down shadow crew they
had taken down Carter dot org they took down max max butler and or Christopher
Aragon they took down both of the guys that were you know selling all the
cards in the forums and everything and you know what max butler did is he did
like a hostile takeover of all the forums he fucking hacked them all took all
locked out all of the admin and then he took all of the users and then put them
all into one fucking one fucking site and sent out emails like you're all just
part of this big community now he locked out all the admin told them to go
fuck themselves and that's it it was like just fucking wild takeover of like
all the forums and then and then yeah and then when they went down it created
a vacuum and then I that's what king pins about yeah yeah and then a kind of I
filled that vacuum like when I came in and started selling cards it was right
after all that shit had happened so there was nobody there was nobody moving
plastic like you know oh my god that's so fucking yeah yeah yeah yeah and then I
came in and then that was it then there was just nobody selling plastic and
that's when it was like yeah so Brett like laid the foundation for all he was
the Godfather shadow crew that was like that platform that he created was like
trust like he said the reason for that was so all these criminals he said the
reason that these like black hat communities could survive and do so
well is because all these criminals could work together and talk to each other
and trust each other and learn from each other and the people who are in the
white hat the good guys they didn't do that they didn't communicate no and you
know there was like in this is back in the tutorial days yeah where you could
go and there was just mean people were just you know tutorial after tutorial
after to then that's how I learned you know what I mean that's I would sit up
I remember until six seven o'clock in the morning the Sun was coming up and I'd
be downloading all these tutorials and I would just be compiling compiling
compiling all this data then I would sit up for days just studying all these
tutorials fucking wild they don't do that anymore that's how I learned how to use
like Photoshop and how to do the video editing just watching YouTube tutorials
hours and hours and hours yeah and this is pre-youtube oh oh yeah YouTube
what that's so crazy yeah this YouTube's what oh seven I don't know I don't
remember seven I think four or five but it did it took a while to take off the
iPhone the first iPhone came out in 2006 and it had YouTube pre-installed on okay
so yeah but I mean like yeah I mean even then like I was I was still doing this
like oh 304 2005 YouTube came out yeah so that's right when that was like my
heyday was like 05 to 09 so came out in 2006 I think it was over sure I think you
look later iPhone one came out I think it was 2006 what was it six oh six oh six
yeah you know so this was like this is so I feel like a dinosaur you know what
I mean like yeah cuz you know now these kids are all on fucking they got something
called telegram now and that's like the big marketplace for all the fraudsters
because it's all encrypted tell you this is yeah this is when you say all of this
is in my book bent which you can find available on Amazon Amazon thank that's
all I'm asking yeah that's not a lot thanks man a shameless plug for for
Ben wrong with the shameless capitalist yeah forever the capitalist yeah better
than the communist yeah dude he was saying Brett was telling me that one of
the guys that he worked really closely with a young guy he said that at one
point because he stepped down from shadow crew another guy stepped like took
his place with a guy he really trusted forget the fucking guy's name right now
as I'm Brett Johnson was ice man that was his name yeah I know I didn't know
that yeah he was ice man like the original like the ice man that everybody
knew like you know what I mean I thought I thought butler was Max butler I
thought he called himself ice man was it max butler was it fucking I'm getting
my facts fucked up I know I'm gonna get crucified in the comments yeah I was
gonna say now somebody was ice man wait wait no bet max butler changed his
name remember he actually changed his name to something maybe it was maximum
or Matt I don't fucking I don't know anyways he said that one of his guys
that he worked really close like three times in prison I love that book he said
one of the guys he worked really closely with just went to an ATM one day
wearing his hoodie and it was like at a Publix ATM and he just sat there with his
hoodie with a backpack full of blank credit cards and he was just at the ATM
standing there for 45 minutes yeah just taking out money and the cop other
random cop car these guys were there getting lunch at Publix and they were
sitting there eating their lunch like this guy's been here for 35 40 minutes
like I'm lazy hey buddy what are you doing ladies and that's how you got caught
you got like a like a damn I think close to a life sentence
laziness man fucking complacency and laziness you don't do that you spread
them out right GPS to shit fucking figure out the ones who have the $100
bills in the high limits I was losing my shit when I was talking to him about how
he was making his money because he was talking about his he did a lot of
identity theft he was making money with tax return fraud he would spend all day
filing 200 tax returns he would find a list all these people that would die
there'd be a registry all the people that I know and if you don't register
those people there he finds like he goes online and finds a list of hundreds of
people social security numbers you can go and find it's the California death
registry California is the only state that leaves the social security numbers
all the rest of states don't oh I'm sorry I got it wrong it was before that it
was the the sexual offenders registry I was gonna say like you can find everything
with the death registry that you know that they know that the people died right
now that it was a that was part of it but before that he got the sexual
offenders registry where you could just go on a website and you could find it
and it was everything from name to social security number sperm count the whole
deal and I'm like that's important that's a very matte Cox would have been able to
find this you would I mean imagine if you would have been able to get a hold of
that and wouldn't have to be like in the most usually have good fucking you
wouldn't have to be fine at homeless people they're half of them got
college education despite their sexual deviancy they're usually fucking you
know pretty good with their money you know I was always was found was funny
when I was doing freedom of information acts on people like I would get stuff
from the 80s or 90s and you get a police report and they would actually have
the social security number on it and and they would take so they would take
like that whiteout you know the what the tape and they would put like tape over
it and send it to me it's like you could just scratch it off and go oh there's
social security numbers 262 you know and you read it off yeah now it's all
digital so now when they send it to you you know it's got a black strip over it
but back then they were like oh look I better wipe that out and send it to him
what kind of idiot does that and I mean I've got probably four different people's
socials that came to me like that through the mail in prison like nice doing
like but when they were handwritten yeah yeah that's insane but that's not as
good as the most you look really buff man have you been working out it's his diet
yeah what's your diet you look you look super jack let's talk about mass diet
early morning gym listen sell ups he's like I eat I eat tv dinners and you know
these guys get so upset like one of those people that just doesn't allow
Matthew doesn't allow himself any pleasure in his life that's not true that's not true
none I know a few people like that that's not true I had ice cream he just
mats like one of those people who just abstain for it forever from everything
on you know I mean like those weird people who are just like just like I'm gonna have
one coke yeah I'm gonna have a sip of this and that's gonna be it till I'd you know
till next week or the month or whatever you go to the gym at like 5 a.m. listen
Matt Matthew during the day you see my video yeah you sent me a video nice right I saw the
Batman video so now they've got they put up little signs that he's all upset about it
they put up little signs now in the gym saying you can't video recording the gym I told him
I hope they got hope they kick you guys out for fucking the shenanigans what was the point of
that what were you guys doing just it was a dare we were sitting there one day in the morning
it's like six o'clock five thirty six o'clock in the morning and we're working out and I'm looking
around I go everybody here looks so miserable and yeah it's five in the morning I know and
just like well because it's five it's like five thirty six and I was like I know that I like I'm
always happy and jumping around I've had a couple cups of coffee I'm like you know come on my turn
that's good you know I'm tickling 20 years in prison of course I'm ecstatic yeah but so I ended
up saying I said you know it'd be funny I said what if we I said what if I walked in one day
because you know a lot of the guys will walk in and they'll be buff and they'll wear like
a superhero outfit it'll say it'll have like a batman or a superman or they have like all the
it looks like this but that doesn't mean they want you to come in dressed as batman doesn't
matter so I said wouldn't it be cool I said you know it'd be great what if I came in what if I
came in with a batman mask and she I said what do you think they'd say and she started laughing
she goes I don't know and I said I'll do it and she goes I'll do it too I said all right order it
I said let's do it and and she said she she says oh I will I said okay we'll see because I know
because Jess is you know super timid and when we got home she goes okay she's what about this one
I was like oh shit she's doing it and then I thought she'll never do it she's never going in here
but it kept getting amped up I was like oh I'm ready I got my mask and she's like oh mine's gonna
be here tomorrow watch and it got there like two days later it got there and she goes okay when
are we doing this I was like uh Wednesday you know that way we're doing chest in it you know it
looks better and she's like okay okay she's like I'm serious I'm like me too and then when we actually
got in the car put on the mask I realized she's not chickening out this is not good like it's going
down I was like I this is I'm semi-embarrassed already we haven't walked in the gym so you know
but it was a dare I had to do it we both walked in we videoed the whole time we walked in we worked
out in the masks nobody said anything nobody said anything no we and we walked right back out and
because they probably thought you guys were fucking insane you're gonna pull out fucking
oozeies and start fucking gunning everybody down in there you're probably he's probably right
let me tell you something you work out wearing a batman mask every weight was light my adrenaline
was so spiked my face was all sweating I was so embarrassed everything went through the whole
thing but everything was light just feeling good like Batman yeah I I said dude I would have been
so embarrassed if I would been there working out you guys would come in I would have had to
left the gym I would have just got in my car and went home like I can't do this it's not
who is this fucking guy what in the fuck is going on here where am I I was proud of Jess for doing
it yeah I never thought she'd do it I was like this is this is good so do you go to the gym at
five a.m. every morning no I mean usually five or six we get there about six do you do anything but
arms that's not fine I do everything I do chest shoulders dries legs back I do everything I'll
do every day yeah I do legs not but you don't go every day I we go every day but Sunday okay every
day but the day that's a heavy routine man yeah and all he eats during the day is scoops of peanut
butter and popsicles I eat scoops of peanut butter too that's it that's true I gave a link I have two
linguisines and he's got a jar of pickled asparagus that he munches on I ate that I killed that I
finished that you eat pickled asparagus so cool I like pickle so good oh that sounds nasty have you
you haven't even tried it no but it sounds gross it's it's amazing I like almost amazing pickled
yeah have you ever seen a rock hopper penguin I don't know what that is Austin google the rock hopper
penguin oh that's funny you gotta find you gotta see this bro this is the funniest bird I've ever
seen in my life what were you gonna ask me you said oh wait let's wait till the podcast you were gonna
ask me something then you go oh wait let me wait till the podcast look at this fucking penguin
yeah in a big picture I've seen those look at his red fucking devil eyes
did you know that that thing existed I've seen those before did you know it was
yeah that's what I was gonna say I've seen it from that I didn't know the name it's in that yeah it's
in that animated film but let's if you I mean to be honest he's cooler looking than a regular penguin
he really has got insane looking there's there's almost half a million of them it's endangered
breeds on islands spends the rest of the time at sea but where can you find them
south atlantic I want to get one Indian Ocean I want to get a pet rock hopper this is exactly why
they're they're in danger yeah people went out and they capture and bring them home they die a week
later because you didn't know how to take care of them that thing looks like it would fuck you up you
put them on a Pixar movie you know where they are Austin can you find where they are for Austin
south atlantic yeah south atlantic yes okay so Indian oceans okay oh I bet you're there are there
penguins in South Africa Austin well look at the map it's right there so South Africa penguins are
usually generally in colder climates yeah South Africa gets pretty damn cold really yeah but is it
frozen all year that's not frozen all year now but the penguins can you know I don't know
how did this come up I just thought it just popped in my head you asked me what I was going to say
before we started the podcast yeah you went to say something and I go what you go you know what
let's wait to the podcast I went okay I don't remember it's not important yeah yeah it wasn't
important it was probably a comment on your v-neck or your giant arms giant arms yeah hey
have you seen that Spongebob episode where he walks around with a super jet of arms yeah
I think you remind me of the Spongebob he goes to the beach and shit
dude remember hey the group chat we had our own little like fraud we had to add you to the group
chat yeah I was gonna mention when I got a those yeah I had those guys knows about all the crazy
conspiracies yeah yeah oh I thought you were meant like every two days I get something about how to
extend your legs or special shoes they send me stuff for special shoes that add two and a half
inches and it's like I typically I'm just I'm like haha and then like two days later it'll say so
it'd be something else about it's just crazy shit man it's fucking fascinating there's this one
doctor on Instagram he specializes in limb extensions right how many how many successful
surgeries does he have I don't know Austin you know what would an unsuccessful one be
you get shorter they amputee no way really not shorter no bro this is common is this really him
you know oh yeah click the top link what do they add like an inch or two no they can add several
inches stop hit the bullshit at the bottom you think I haven't looked into this height he's already
got an appointment book I mean that's extreme he's got it on his vision board yeah yeah
oh are you to look at the first thing says are you tired of being short
do you feel self-conscious about your height oh I know where to the point where your happiness
is being compromised listen if you've made it this far they don't need to do much selling
now what yeah yeah you've already looked it up click on that first video which you need to do
how much how much and what's the recovery time recovery time that's what I looked into it was
how much could this be what what I looked into it probably a couple hundred thousand dollars
it was you were basically has to be immobile for like six to eight well that's it's done in like
south america they're fucking with your femurs in shit right bunion surgery too though the bunions
your grandma got bunions mm-hmm all right well turn the volume up let's see what they tear you apart
oh shit
is there any way you can pipe it through the audio
procedure uh one of the key aspects to this surgery is the consultation and that's when
we meet together Matt I got a great idea for a video and that's a good time to ask
any additional questions that hasn't already been that guy was like 80 yeah you see that I was about
to say that what the fuck is that guy sitting there for both of us to meet so that I could examine
you and make sure that that guy that bothers me because that guy looked tall so the consultation
involves you know asking a few questions and then I would do a physical exam because I really need
to know how like come on man it's too late to be getting taller oh pop people popito wants to go
in there and fucking all your muscles and joints get a little bit tight you gotta have good
oh my god prior to your surgery uh if you don't have very good flexibility start working on it now
after the physical exam then I have you take x-rays so that I could measure your bones and make sure
that there's no issues uh that's gonna take place with the insertion of the nail oh my god your bone
can't be too curved uh it cannot have any kind of defects so these are the things that I look for
and at the same time I make the uh oh my god uh measurements for the nails that you're gonna need
after that we'll talk about finances regarding the surgery and then if you're ready at that time
and I see that it's a good fit for you then we could schedule the surgery date for you
really what are you talking about they're signing up for the procedure they tear you apart in there
they are that that is sometimes you have to do it they just gotta be a brutal fucking surgery oh yeah
I do understand that people are concerned regarding the pandemic and we've been doing
surgeries uh during this whole time uh in fact okay you can shut her down oh wait yeah let's see the
before and after that with three inches five six to five nine how would you like that man
do you think you could do this for your fucking dick they can make your cock three inches longer I
hear that they have that save a surgery I heard that's their surgery is extremely fucking like
dangerous like people die all the time getting that fucking surgery done the rate of people that die
getting the fucking penis extension surgery all right you can turn it off Austin it's wild
really yeah I read that fact I read that fact somewhere I wonder why I have no idea it's
it's some shit you shouldn't be fucking with Austin can you pull up some before and afters on
here I'm gonna get penis surgery that's like so that's not just sounds dangerous of the height
thing not the penis thing what's more what's more absurd do you think penis enlargement or
limb lengthening limb lengthening absurd I mean being someone who needs both um
it's a toss up right I admire your honesty no which one's more absurd yeah oh bro I would never
limb lengthening sounds a little more absurd to be honest I would lengthening like I can
understand a lot of people they're both extreme look at their penis size but that's like I'm not
limbs extended she she got taller what the hell is she doing oh look at that
man bro all these guys this is outrageous like yeah these these aren't subtle height yeah these
are big big height differences yeah I want to see like their legs with their legs let's see the
fuck don't don't wear jeans I don't want to see his shit looks tore up god damn wow what are they
extending like the lower femur I mean you think your femur your skin stretches
find some more good photos Austin this is oh my god look at this guy nine months later the
little tiny he looks like a little he looked like a little person no the one
yeah it seems like the one guy look look where it says nine months later look how tiny
that's gotta be clickbait that's the same picture they only did one oh you can only do one leg at a
time because it takes the recovery time oh my god so then what happens you gotta wait for it to
heal then they do the other leg there's gotta be a gimp till you're all hobbling around for
fucking six yeah it's just like the bunion surgery bro bunion surgery yeah people got fucked up feet
where they have like a can you've seen like a hammer toe I got one where like it is bad the
side of it comes always on gangster lean no just google super lean find it awesome show me a picture

Danny's foot looks like right there Pikachu oh man look at that one look look at the yellow one

joke that we have from high school we just called Danny blimp head because his head's real big yeah
I got it stuck around for a long time so like hey get a blimp a good year blimp tattooed on your
leg I was like okay what'd you get I got a Humpty Dumpty on my thigh
yeah this guy came in a few months ago I was just working at a tattoo shop in Indianapolis
I was in Indiana I don't know if you know that I was in fucking Indiana for like six months
before I came here for what uh I got swindled into coming out there man I was in I was living in
Phoenix um swindled and yeah I got swindled for sure and this dude reached out to me on Instagram
and asked me if I wanted to come to uh Sturgis South Dakota and tattoo during bike week yeah yeah
for like five days and I'd never been to start I'd never done Sturgis I was like fuck and I get
the tattoo so I went up to Sturgis uh I tattooed for like five days or six days or whatever it was
and then he asked me if I wanted to do a guest spot at his shop in this small town in uh just
outside of Indianapolis Indiana so I was like yeah fuck it you know what I mean like it's summertime
and I was like figure I'd go out there and make a couple more thousand dollars and so I go out there
and I just got super comfortable he had like a he had like a cool shop I thought it was cool
you know what I mean and like he gave me like my own big booth and everything and like kind of like
talked me into like working full time at the shop and it's like and at that time I was like I was
living in Phoenix and I really wasn't doing that much tattooing like I was but it wasn't like I
wasn't busy you know what I mean and then like but Indiana wherever like for whatever reason he just
had a really busy shop so I literally show up and tattoo for 12 hours a day seven days a week if I
wanted to really yeah it's that it was that busy you know and that's all I've ever wanted I just
want to tattoo at that point you know exciting you know what was most what was most fucked up tattoo
you did when you were a surrogate oh um I bet you there were some fucking characters come on oh yeah
there was but it was like I just did a lot of Harley badges like the like the bed like what do
they call it the badge and shield and badge or bar and shield or whatever it is the Harley logo it's
the bar and shield I did so many of those fucking I doing husbands and wife with each other's names
in them and fucking so many of those um just a lot of weird biker tattoos I wonder what the most
popular tattoo in the world is like what what tattooing more people have depends on who you are
Harley would probably be up there butterflies and fucking hearts I've done really probably more of
those in my entire career than I have anything else butterflies and heart butterfly hearts and
butterflies infinity symbols you know all the little Pinterest fucking bullshit those teenage
girls are not the teenage girls but you know the young girls come in and get um yeah I've done a
lot of those I think the most I wouldn't say fucked up tattoo I did but the most wild tattoo I've
ever done was probably when so I was working at this tattoo shop in Miami it was a 24 hour shop
and if you guys know anything about like 24 hour tattoo shops they're always pretty sketch

was she reading the book took it like a champ yeah when she fucked up was she on was she taking
like um watching one of your drugs podcast she kind of seemed like she was on downers maybe you
had to be or that maybe was just her personality you think she was on the blue boys oh no man
who knows with that chick listen I tattooed a dude uh rock she's on rocks I tattooed a dude in
Indianapolis and this motherfucker came in all banged up I don't know what he's on heroin or
fucking or oxycodone or something I tattooed his face and he slept completely through it I tattooed
on both sides I mean the dude was covering it he had tattoos all over his fucking face you know the
story of Gucci man when he got his ice cream tattooed in his face he got that the day he got
out of fucking the mental institution yeah he was just I think he slept I think they interviewed
his tattoo artist and his tattoo artist that he slept the whole thing oh he's on meds for sure
oh yeah he was heavy if he was coming straight out of the psych ward he was fucking heavily
medicated oh really yeah because that's the day he got released from the psych ward he got the
fucking ice cream cone on his face yeah no this I tattooed a big money bag in this dude's
fucking face and he sent me a picture of when he was doing it I posted my instagram of the guy
like I boom he said this guy I'm tattooing this guy he's asleep right now and then I said I said
to him that he's yeah with his mouth open and I had the stencil on his face yeah the dude was
all banged up on something it was fucking hilarious I've never tattooed anybody's face and they
fucking snored through it that was a first for me so I've been tattooing a long time yeah
yeah it was wild my leg they didn't really hurt that bad the top of my thigh it wasn't
really as bad as I thought it would be yeah fucking hurt the belly dude for me was probably the worst
um really yeah it was the fucking worst man it's the worst pain I've ever experienced in my life
yeah out of everything I have your tattooed someone's dick I've never done a penis
I just that's just I refuse you know that's where I draw the line you know what I mean yeah
that's where I draw I don't know it's probably more sanitary than a girl I mean unless it was
like a buddy or something like that I don't know yeah no look at me bro let's get your fucking
let's get your long tattoo I think listen we're gonna have to start having like a list of things we
we can't top it we cannot discuss yeah you know but I think for the for the right price make you
uncomfortable yeah really yeah Matt's afraid that he might turn gay or the yeah it was the other one
that made me feel uncomfortable other than the oh the penis extension the the legs thing yeah
you're hitting on all the buttons we're hitting them all what's that famous quote what's that what's
uh what's that quote about uh I forget what who had that quote but he said something about homophobic
or people who hate gays the only people who hate gays are idiots and people who are afraid that
they might be gay dumb dumb people and then people who are afraid that they might be gay
it's probably true those are gonna be able to hate gays or that are secretly gay themselves
right that's right yeah same and are just mad at the world right yeah those are homophobes yeah I
have a cousin um that when I grew up with uh my whole life and he would always every few years he
would just like wildly change like his whole like who he was like so okay first he started out
back in the day like when we were kids he was a punk rocker he wore the fucking the wrist bands
he had he had the mohawk he was in a punk rock band played guitar the whole night uh and then he
became like we got a little bit older in the middle school he became like a skateboarder like a
skater and that became and then like and so every time he changed like what he did with his life
that became his whole persona so then he went from being a punk rocker to like a skater he's like
hardcore fucking skateboarder you know a skater which is like it's a usual transition because
you know punk rock because they skateboard and you know they grow out of the fucking punk rock
shit and they get into skating which is that's the normal transition then he would then he went
into hip hop and he was going to be like a rapper uh he was at the stand and listen and he when he
goes in he fucking goes all the way in like he would go to the studio every day he was doing
shows like not he didn't have like a fucking the record contract selling out but he was doing like
little like venues like around town and shit you know what I mean like open like they like they
booked fucking he had some little dude that was going and booking him shows I think he opened
up for three six mafia uh one time really that's a crazy story I hit DJ Paul with a fucking beer
that night no yeah yeah because this stupid bitch I was with fucking runs up on stage one second keep
going keep going this stupid bitch I'm with runs up on stage because at the end of every show like
DJ Paul and like Juicy J and shit they come out and they're like they start you know they do crowd
work and he was and Juicy J came out and he was like I'll give the first bitch who gets up on stage
and gets cornhold a thousand dollars and who do you think the first cunt fucking run the run up on
stage was the bitch I'm with my girlfriend at the time I'm like this fucking stupid dirty whore
and you know of course she's got the fake titties so she's always so she gets up there and immediately
just takes off her shirt pulls the titties out we're in a packed fucking vet we're in a packed
fucking venue with all with like 5000 people with a thousand people here it's fucking insane
so she pulls up she goes up on stage first thing she does takes off her shirt her fucking titties
are out and I'm so fucking pissed I just whiz my beer up at her you know I'm standing in the crowd
I fucking whiz my beer up there trying to hit her with it I hit DJ Paul on accident with my beer
so then the guy standing next to me I grab here's beer out of his hand and I fucking whiz that one
up there and that one fucking hit security then all of a sudden all the lights come on they're like
whoa whoa whoa I just do an about face and I immediately just walk fucking right out of the
club yeah dumb cunt and then I got she had her purse in my car I took it out and I dumped it
out in the fucking parking lot like this the whole fucking thing fucking kicked it like a soccer
ball that bitch anyway what was I talking about how did this start with your cousin who always
changed everything yeah yeah yeah so anyway looks good back to that I got off on a fucking
I had to tell a side story right so every couple years my cousin like changes who he is and then
he makes that his whole persona so after the hip hop shit kind of like fizzled out he became
like this hardcore right wing republican fucking anti-government you know they're gonna fucking
confiscate your guns he was wearing off fatigues he was posting on Facebook every day getting
kicked off you know like he thought he was in like some kind of militia and then
he turned into a transgender now he's no longer James he's Jamie no way I swear to
fucking god he's a trans fucking gender now he's covering all the bases this is a good segue
to the transgender that got the two other feet the two female prison yeah two female prisoners
pregnant oh yeah yeah yeah I'll send you a link I'll send you a screenshot of that yeah but now
he's uh and he shows up at all the family functions um as Jamie but then as the night goes on he like
literally like starts changing his clothes and changing his voice and shit and then by the end
of the night he's fucking Jamie or whatever the girl and I'm like listen this motherfucker isn't
a transgender he's mentally ill is what it is right yeah you know what I mean like you don't
fucking do all of these things throughout your whole entire life and now all of a sudden you're
a transgender like that's fucking insanity not that I don't have anything against transgender
I don't give a fuck do what you do get how you live what is that though like what is that about
something that wants to change their identity yeah it's crazy it's something it's some kind of
dysfunction he has man yeah you know but you know whatever if he wants to live his life as a woman
now that's you know dude do do what you do but you know what the fuck yeah that's fucking crazy
and what listen my other cousin called me and told me that I'm like no fucking way he's like dude
I swear to god he's like and then he shot me a link and I guess he's on pornhub riding a
fucking 12 inch dildo oh man what yeah dude if you have fucking it was why I didn't I didn't
watch it I didn't click on the link but fucking imagine if he was on pornhub riding a 12 inch
dildo wearing a trump hat and the fatigues
how many how confusing with that yeah dude he's like so now he's like a transgender porn star
and like the whole thing is just out of control dude I'm telling you my family's fucked up dude
that is we need to get him on here yeah right better hurry before he switches to something else
yeah I was to put that back up on the screen
well so what happened what happened with the person in jail the transgender
so a guy a transgender woman a guy who's now a woman transitioned to female right but but has
not but has no yes it was a man that is now saying he's he identifies as a female but hasn't
had the surgery just said hey I'm a woman they said oh well then you need to go to the woman's
prison he said yes I do there's no way to allow that if you have a dick the new jersey he got two
women pregnant read the whole thing liberal judge or whatever up there in new jersey they passed all
these laws now so I listen to hold to a they don't have fucking DeSanto no DeSanto for president
DeSanto you like DeSanto for president oh yeah yeah yeah I think you'd be pretty good I mean you'd
be awesome and they were there was making jokes they said uh well they don't they don't want to
take them away we need them down they're like we don't need to want to take them away from Florida
and they're like fucking Trump could be the goddamn governor of Florida yeah
he would win oh yeah it's the greatest it's the greatest state in the country yeah yeah I don't
want to be the fucking governor I don't think Trump's gonna be the president again either I don't
think he'll do it you don't think so you don't think he's gonna run in 2024 I don't know I don't
think I don't look at this guy he swindled the whole system for sure he's looking at the camera
he's like I can't believe they let me fucking do this can you fucking believe they let me in here
I love the state of New Jersey yeah so it's an all women's prison and then out of nowhere two of
the Demetrius just show up pregnant I don't care I think they I think they actually read it like you
on one of these he impregnated two of the female inmates who
do but don't don't call him it says it says inmates yeah two female inmates that is fucking
he's a guy he's a guy he's in in that is fucking wild that they would let him in there
and it's pretty wild man like at the end of the day dude in New Jersey yeah yeah is that the only
state that allows that there's quite a few I'm sure they have really quite a few that they're
I'm sure there's more than one I mean it's no different than all those
transgender's going into women's sports and just fucking like shattering records and shit
why the fuck wouldn't they really shattering records I mean women's records yeah because
they're women because I think I think what the argument I think what the argument is when it
really boils down to when the Supreme Court sets these fucking precedences for like you know
equal fucking rights for you know everybody and you got they had you know the Supreme Court
saying that now you have to recognize whatever gender I identify with now that has to be recognized
not only you know fucking person to person but it has to be recognized now like Supreme Court
says so so now the argument is I'm you know if the Supreme Court says I'm a woman why am I in
a men's prison you know what I mean so then so there's like a catch 22 and everybody's like oh
my god I don't know what to do and nobody wants to fucking you know fight it because they're
for reelection you know what I mean they don't want to what if you're a security guard in there
say you're some woke security guard in the prison or whatever and you support it and you walk by and
you see uh you know you're all about you know transgender rights change everything is what
inmates is the right thing inmates aren't supposed to be that's against the rules regardless yeah
whether it's two men or two women yeah so you think you're a security guard and that's uh naughty
naughty and you see your correctional officer correctional officer walk by and you see some
guy just fucking banging down some chick they would they would immediately you get in trouble
put the hose on them yeah first get first you gotta separate them and then they both go to the
shoe and then they both get written up for whatever having sex there used there was a time when they
used to write an incident report and then they would mail it home to your family but they stopped
doing that yeah that was like 20 years ago and they would mail it so your wife would know
two men like your husband is having sex with another man oh and then they stopped doing that
imagine this guy's family gets the letter they're like god damn Demetrius look what he's up to now
his father's probably proud smart man you game the system yeah everybody does their time different
yeah sex everybody does their time different i think more men should compete in women's sports though
i like it we need to show them who's you know we need to show them that we're the dominant we're
the dominant gender that's funny man it's just i don't know the whole thing's just bananas to me
to be honest with leah thomas that was her name yeah has anyone ever interviewed her about it
i haven't i mean i haven't gone looking for any interviews or any of the girls that she competed
against i haven't come across any interviews or anything i'm sure the other girls are probably
pissed off what do they say they're upset there's all the kinds of controversy about it they're
like what the fuck's going on here they've been trained in their whole life to dominate a sport
and then this guy just comes in and smokes i'm not even close i'm fucking swimming faster than
them pull up david lucas pull up david lucas find a clip that was fucking a david lucas yeah

you know what i mean like uh mkbhd fucking look uh um uh um what's his name click on his videos
it's over it's bad it's mean you know he's listening he's he's he's been on the he's been on the
she's been on the channel for a long time dude he puts out videos every day every other day
and they all do numbers we're running out of time satan but i mean yeah i mean listen he you know
all of this i like this i like this kind of shit this is i love it world war z i watch this guy a
lot man i watch him like every day it's over like this is all depressing it's all read every title
there it's like this is world war z i love this guy oh that's probably talking about the russians
invading ukraine yeah yeah so he's on top of it man like anything that's going on anytime
anything happens right hit movie that in about the zombies if they start moving troops anywhere
he makes a video about it like okay now they're fucking over here and this is this this could
likely happen because now they got fucking this many guys on the front line and you know this is
if they do this strategy then they could be then it could go nuclear but then this is this this
happens then the nuclear option is taken off and he's like a finland and fucking what's the name
join nato and fucking that could cause this problem and dude he does a really good job of
explaining everything and breaking it all down and he's not like um one of those fucking crazy
people that are just like you're like everything that he's saying is just like facts you're like
he's just breaking he's just basically breaking everything down and giving you you know i mean
exactly what's happening play by play and he doesn't do too much interjecture you know what i mean
like a lot of it's not opinionated like and i told you guys this was all gonna end he doesn't do
those kinds of things and he delivers a delivers all this information in a very straightforward
very well spoken put together way you know i mean other than the war promising to see that he
hasn't been banned from youtube i like that i mean i'm sure all of these are demonetized
oh yeah no youtube's been been releasing a little bit of the pressure off that kind of shit lately
i feel like i haven't had an episode they just sent out on wood i haven't had an episode demonetized
in like months and i've been doing here by some pretty edgy do you ever fight them i mean the i
always do always do the last one i got demonetized what about elon musk buying twitter i got one
demonetized a month ago and i don't even know why i should fucking dispute that one i told you
just i don't ever disputed i'm just like oh well you think elon could afford youtube no uh he can
barely afford twitter they're trying to squeeze them out already they're fucking terrified
terrified of him taking over twitter why do you think that is well because you know they have an
agenda obviously yeah and he they he's gonna disrupt that which is either gonna either amount to them
losing dollar dollar dollar money signs or them losing power or you know control over whatever
narrative that they're you know what i mean that they're trying to control because that's the only
thing you do when you suppress people's speech and this is what blew me away because i'm not a big
twitter guy i don't not a big twitter user i mean i i think you know telling people uh every thought
that comes into your brain constantly all days you know not a good way to communicate and so i didn't
know what twitter what i mean i knew what it was so i get on twitter i start messing around
and i'm like no way there's fucking porn right here on twitter and i was like i'm like in in my
mind i'm i'm chewing it over i'm like so they allow this right but they won't allow the president of
the united states to just speak his mind that's bullshit i'm like there has to be some kind of
agenda that told me right then and there that there's some kind of internal fucking agenda at twitter
to what's whatever narrative that they feel society you know and and me elon musk is like listen
twitter is the de facto platform for public communication it's basically the new public
square so controlling that is a serious impediment to democracy to free speech so something needs to
be done about it and that's why he got in there and like listen something you know what i mean like
fucking something is changing elon really gives a fuck or do you think he just wants clout uh you
know i'm i'm a true believer of elon musk i don't i don't think the guy has an evil bone in his body
i don't think he does anything out of self-servience it's not evil to one clout i mean maybe he
listen he likes to be in the camera he likes to fucking you know the the the the pretty girlfriend
and the fucking you know the cool billionaire like i get it but it's like he's gonna do it for the
clout i don't if he if he is doing it for the clout he's he's also gonna make good changes
and positive changes to the platform so that it betters humanity like i'm a true believer in elon
musk like i'm a true believer i'm i genuinely think that he's a good dude that has the means
and the willingness to want to change the world for the better period i mean we're all we were
human at the end of the day so of course he's gonna have flaws but i don't think he's like a bill
gates fucking kind of character like you know what i mean like sitting there thinking you know how
can we fucking uh you know stick people and and and give him some kind of shot to change him i do
i watch some shit on bill gates uh he was giving a speech to the cia and somebody like recorded it
and it was on fucking tiktok and austin uh i if not i think i have it saved i think i had to screen
record it because it didn't have the save option on the fucking tiktok and when they do that you
know what there's some malarkey going on um i love fucking tiktok oh yeah i do you see my tiktok
feed it's all fucking every fucking every one you on tiktok every one is all fucking do you post
on there i do just for the just for the podcast every week so i'm gonna get into doing clips and
you know i'm starting to do the whole tiktok uh shit but anyway i was like i'm searching you
oh boziak nundrum podcast okay keep going and so it's bill gates and he's giving a speech to
a bunch of secret service guys or i don't know who they were it may have may have been secret
service it may have been it was some kind of government body and he was telling them that
there was a vaccine that he could give out that suppresses a gene that makes people that for in
people that are more likely to commit suicide bombings and commit like acts of like religious
fucking like like terror and he's like they they they've isolated a gene in the in the middle eastern
people over there because they they have the genome the bill gates is involved in all kinds of crazy
shit but he was saying like we understand now the gene that is more expressive in people who are
more willing to do suicide bombings and like kill like mass people for like religious reasons and
he's like we've developed a vaccine that suppresses that gene so that they would be and it went on
and on and on to so he explained more and in more detail about it i'm just like holy fucking shit are
you kidding me they're over there giving vaccines to people to suppress some kind of gene so that
don't fucking suicide bomb like it's insane like he's giving speeches to the government
on this shit it's fucking bananas and you're somehow making a bunch of money off you have to
find this video i have to watch this listen i think i honestly i think i have it saved on my phone
i fucking do i might my favorite thing i've seen on tiktok recently is a clip of johnny depp listening
to deposition and i've just seen that and is like and uh she said that she was bored to death
because his friends would come over and it was just a bunch of old men playing guitar
and they're boring and they're boring and he's just like he's sitting there's like
he's fucking loving it he's he's just like i don't know it's great i think it's classic
great moment because you know it's just him and maryland manson doing coke upstairs
playing guitar was old guys jamming that's funny i heard she cut off one of his fingers
do you guys hear that i heard she cut herself and then maybe that was him how the how the
fucking the stories change i heard i heard they're arguing she chopped off the tip of
one of his fingers or some shit that's crazy see this is how it goes with the conspiracy theories
it sounds great when you say it on a podcast i know then when you go to the fucking proof
when you go to fucking do the work and find the evidence it ain't there no i save all this
shit man i got listen i i'll say i have to i'll fucking send you the video because i what i do
is when i get too many on my phone i upload them to my fucking uh my ipad did you know i mean bill
gates is buying up more farmland i think right now than any one else in the world yeah well he's
going to be the number one landowner in america behind black rock i'm not sure if you know about
black rock yeah i know a lot about black rock they're buying up everything they're they they
they just bought like a million single family fucking uh rental properties across america and
they're looking to buy well they're buying they're buying homes everything they're buying up
the whole entire market yeah yeah they're gonna so in the future i don't know if you don't understand
like the economic forum and the new world order and davos how they meet in davos every year and the
dude schwab fucking runs the economic forum yeah i know i got the whole plan that would explain
what that is explain can you explain for dummies what the new world order is so all right so the
new world order is a uh it's a it's a it's kind of a plan um pretty much that's an hour long video
austin yeah i see jean go ahead sorry to interrupt yeah so the new world order uh there's so there's
a group we should probably start off by by saying there's a group of people uh none this is like
you know how there used to be the uh the builder bird group now it's kind of similar to the
builder bird group but it's called the world economic forum it's uh pretty much just a conglomerate
of ceo's cfo's fucking world leaders you know all of these corporations and power very powerful
people they get together and they set um they have basically just come together once a year
and they write out an agenda for what how they you know want to see whatever industry they're in
pushed forward or moved forward or whatever so i mean obviously you're going to have people from
the end that represent energy there you're going to have people that represent um you know manufacturing
every sect of society there have have spoke to people there at this economic world forum
now it's all run by a dude named claus claus schwab who i guess he's like an industrialist
um claus schwab yeah yeah he's just he's a real bad guy apparently i don't he's a globalist you
know so i in my opinion i mean i don't really don't have opinion he's like a uh he's kind of like a um
uh george soros type yes george soros george soros type of character um you know so so yeah like i
said the world economic forum they get together and they basically put forth something called the new
world order and it's titled the new world order uh it's not a conspiracy theory they that's what
they call it themselves it's from their own if you go and you can google yourself and go on their
uh their website and it says new world order and their vision for the future uh it's a one world
government um all completely digitized currency and basically uh you will own nothing and you will
be happy so basically you know physical ownership of like homes and vehicles and like everything
will be gone because it'll all be owned by the corporations and every there's going to be like
uh uh you know like a universal basic income like a ubi you know what i'm saying like because like
listen you gotta you gotta understand that automation is going to take over you know algorithms and
automation is going to you know basically phase out all aspects of manual labor when it comes to
like logistics and a lot of other jobs i mean i've been to listen i walk into cvs and it's all
fucking self-check out now and there's just one chick walking around doing stock that well that
didn't happen five years ago you go in there'd be three or four cash registers and you'd go in there
there wouldn't be any self-checkout you know and now i'm seeing videos of gas stations that are
completely with no attendance there you walk in and everything's in vending machines on the inside
and you pay with your car at the pump yeah so you know like automation is going to take over it's
going to phase out you know large sacks of society who are going to need income the large corporations
are going to come in the amazons the fucking jeff bezos and the fucking the the claus schwabs and
george soros is are going to come in and there's a whole new fucking global cabal cabal of people
that have set up this this whole new blueprint of how we're going to live our lives in the future
and these guys control everything so i mean that's the new world order and how does bill gates
tying to this bill will bill gates is a globalist and you know he has the bill gates melinda gates
foundation which they control you know large swaths of real estate they control they have
bio labs set up all over the world i mean in fact the some of the bio labs that are in the
ukraine right now are funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation so you know and listen the
rabbit hole goes fucking as deep as you want to fucking climb yeah you know what i mean like all
these fucking dirty slithering cocksuckers are all in bed with each other and it's all so
fucking convoluted and twisted together it'll make your fucking head spin but you know what i mean
cia one i heard it was a hoax i heard that bill gates was buying up all the land in the us because
he wanted to start uh basically creating like cheap processed food for everyone like he wants to
basically replace our food well who he who controls the food and the money controls the people right
in you know factory farming and well he's all about he's just a nice guy he's all about that's one
there he's one theory isn't isn't bill gates isn't it true that he's like all about pushing like
no meat only vegan oh no i'm not i i hate him yeah i don't know i thought he's not nice anymore
i actually thought he was like buying cattle and like was all about like controlling the factory
farm i could be wrong i should be wrong but i i heard that i heard that he was trying to like
the cia thing that's that's a hoax what is this did bill gates briefed the cia in 2005
about a mind-altering vaccine it was a 2020 hoax that said in 2005 he had briefed them but it was
actually a hoax scroll down scroll down this is disinformation that hoax fake news hoax bill
gates is right there and it's his voice and they're taught what is that he was he they were just
playing around they were just you know let's put this photoshop the word hoax on top of it let's see
let's see i don't see any video what the fuck is this website snopes that's the screenshot though
that's the video i i swear to god i have that video so i have it either on my ipad or austin you
gotta do some more digging to chop up somebody bill gates has enough enough um interviews you could
chop up what he said i mean bill gates i mean he talks about vaccines all the time i don't know
how old the guy is but you know that he's definitely i know i heard somewhere i don't know for a fact but
i think this was proven that he invested like somewhere in the realm of like 20 million dollars
into uh biointech two months before before i think it was in
he's september in september of 2019 or 2018 before the lab leak actually happened so before there was
some there's some scientists in the lab in wuhan they got sick for they were the first
people to get sick and get get the coronavirus so like two months before that he invested like
somewhere in the realm of like 20 million dollars in biointech the company that created
one of the vaccines okay but but keep in mind this is a guy who's investing in stuff all the time
he gave he gave a ted talk that said the next pandemic isn't a if it's a when this was like three
or four years before so he was he's been all in on the vaccine and the pandemic like he you know
i mean the last 10 or 15 years he's been talking here's the actual video look at some of the work
he's been doing over in africa here's the bill gates video that you were talking about earlier
look at those statistics is it yes it shows it highlights part of the brain yes click on that
off this is it and the left over here we have individuals who are religious fund fundamentalists
religious fanatics oh wow the expression uh rtpcr real time pcr that could that quick expression of
the b-mat two gene so our our hypothesis is that these are fanatical people uh that they have
over expression of the b-mat two gene and that by vaccinating them against this will eliminate
this behavior trying to tell you guys this is a hoax it means he said he's got a vaccine hold on a
second fix it here we have two brain scans these are fmri's uh these are two different i don't
have anything that's bill bill gates stop it that's bill gates do no way uh is an individual who's a
religious fanatic and individual and repeated this numerous times that that has a high level for
the amount to do what the fuck is he saying i don't think that looks like bill gates that's a hundred
percent stop it dude no way hundred percent yeah hundred you 100 percent thousand percent listen
to his voice i you couldn't pick him out of a lineup that's bill gates man would have the effect
that you see here which is he talks with his hands a lot it's the same gestures the same voice
he's got the glasses he's not saying he he's also i can't hear this i can't hear this
okay when you watch it on your own it's not it's like it was it 10 more minutes
all right austin you can stop it we were the fucking description of this video what is the
description of this video try to tell you click on the no go up go up and then click go down
click on the title click on that yeah back all right now pause it pentagon video leaked briefing
on fun vac so wait is it bill gates
that you said hundred percent yeah you were a hundred percent 100 that's a done he said done
deal it doesn't say bill gates his name anywhere on here said the video was edited you can notice
in some parts pixels i don't know man no wait you were sure a second 100 100 percent
actually a hoax but that's fine you guys were positive listen i'd have had all your money
listen right now bro i'm a different person now listen what the fuck was he even talking about
first of all it's not even clear what he never was talking about a vaccine he's talking about the
the v-mat gene in the fucking you know that they can vaccine to suppress what do you mean no the
fucking they can suppress that gene to fucking make them not blow them shit up yeah that's what
the whole fucking first first thing you can't just give somebody a gene to say hey there i'm gonna
give you a gene it's a vaccine that suppresses a certain gene in the fucking body right so you
can do those things now matt you know they have that kind of technology now and why aren't they hitting
the transgenders with it whoa okay so i mean if you can do that why aren't they why aren't they
saying hey you're you're criminal thinking boom they give you give you a a a maximum guess what now
you're not because the supreme court hasn't fucking said we could yet because you and we haven't
gotten there you're not gonna do this either and it's a hoax anyway it's a hoax well it's a it's a fun
hoax if it is oh my god find the youtube comments we need to see the top youtube comment on this
or could we read the article that says it's a what's the top comment say that's that's that's all
i know we're going to you it's not real but i think the concept was supposedly that it would
suppress that gene whether you interrupt whether you interpret that as killing the person
so they can spread their seed is not the matter but that wasn't the take idea as far as i can't
understand it i mean it wasn't that fucking clear what they were talking about but i don't
even think it was bill gates it sounded a lot like bill gates it sounded a lot like i still think
it's fucking true i'm just sticking to my fucking original most scientists i believe it i believe
there's something there's something awkward about yeah there's awkward they're nerdy they got that
kind of their kind of have that asperger thing going on listen when you're that intelligent
you know you're not hanging out relate to that person you're not far as in picking boogers with
the rest of the fucking teenage kids you're not charismatic you're in a book i understand you
could have you're in a book yeah okay he also invested okay yeah he invested 50 million into
impossible foods and actively finances beyond meat um what me he probably sees what does that say
ginkgo bioworks biomig as described above fake food ever yeah i mean our clates claims it is a real
solution to climate change and solves environmental degradation while also ironing out animal welfare
concerns you know it's all about climate change that's why so he's buying more fucking farmland
anyone else in the in the country right now he's buying up so much farmland i got into a heated
discussion with matt because matt thinks climate change is a hoax matt doesn't believe matt doesn't
believe in in man and climate change he doesn't believe in global warming i know i know it's not
that i don't believe it there is going to the the earth has throughout history has gotten cold and
gotten hot it's got cold it's got hot and i don't think that we have that much to do with it i don't
think we have i mean it depends what you consider is that much i think there definitely is i mean
is there some listen some human beings definitely and since the since the dawn of the industrial
revolution we've been literally dipping digging fucking carbon up from the from the ground and
putting it into the atmosphere and giant fucking quantities and if you don't think that has anything
to do with the fucking i think you just told me that bill gates bill gates is is going to vaccinate
everybody to make them non-terrorist too so i you some of what you're saying suspect there's i'm just
saying science that's science okay that that's science to listen and i don't fuck what they're
talking about that's listen bro that's the fucking bill he is the doing shit like that the problem is
it's there's way too much information out there for any single person to comprehensively understand
at once so it's just easier to pick one side and then argue whatever points that you hear
somebody else talk about plus we live in echo chambers um you know and everything that we
look at online is tailored to only give us the information that we're looking for which kind
of creates like these like i said these echo chambers yeah so if i only live i need to reset
your one thing because every time i turn around you're listening to something that's talking about
the end of the world or the economy is crushing and this so fun you're what are you listening to
this are you listening to this and i'm like bro please turn that off i know i get all fucking
tuned up because you reset they're taking over bro they're like i'm on painting can we
please can we just i gotta lean cuisine yeah i have to heat up a lean cuisine and yeah we went
to i tried to go to starbucks the other day and when we got in there i ordered food and then he
just sat there and looked at all the food went i can't i can't eat this i can't do this no i i

like i can't eat the fucking i hate tofu no i can't eat the tofu and i can't eat the fucking um
the soy you know what i mean so i lost a lot of weight and but yeah i tell you what i never felt
better in my entire life like the amount of energy when you were vegan when i was vegan really yeah
i just i always had like my energy like now it's like a roller coaster because of my eating
like i'll eat and like low energy yeah but like he doesn't drink coffee like everything i
i was also doing coke every day it's it's all coffee no i never did cocaine sugar and everything
and all he eats is like carbs and just you ever met a vegan who does a shitload of coke
i don't think i know any vegans oh man yeah so needless to say right i have to know somebody
who's a vegan i got off the vegan shit because it was just like i was losing too much weight man
i didn't really yeah i didn't like the way i looked but i felt great i felt like where you
working out um yeah when i was running every day i was doing a lot of cardio and uh a little
bit a little bit of weights here and there but i had more energy when i don't eat sometimes i
do like a five day i do these five day fasts like once a year i'm gonna get on like day four you
don't eat for five days yeah stop it when i get to day four or five i have like you'll fall over
insane amounts of energy no no i can do three times the amount of pull-ups i can normally do
when i'm you don't you weigh five ten pounds a lot lighter this guy this guy how much how much
weight do you lose in those five days it's gotta be a lot i didn't really i didn't
what's your body type is it you probably got endomorph i don't know what the fuck so there's
three different body types there's ectomorph esomorph and endomorph what's the difference
endomorph is at the high end at the high end so it's like you gain weight really easy but it's
hard to lose it ectomorph is where i'm at like i can't it's hard for me to gain weight but it's
real easy for me to lose it and then in the middle you kind of get like the endomorph people who can
fucking gain and they can swing their weight wildly just based on their diet with a little with
little effort i've weighed 165 pounds for like the last 10 years i've very and you can pretty much
i very maybe a pound and a half to two pounds and what's your diet mean do you like restrict
yourself to like i'm not going to eat carbs or just eat whatever you want keto i i try to
is are you doing a joke oh my god i've tried it i i don't know i don't do the keto guido i eat
whatever i want now i i tried doing keto for a couple months i just i couldn't do it that's rough
it is rough it sucks i i've never done it but i don't roommates were on it and i'm telling you
what i used to fuck with them every night after i learned about kino i stopped eating pasta so i
used to eat fucking pasta at least one night a week but after that after i learned about i i just
cut out like i'd never i rarely eat a plate of spaghetti or pasta or whatever but i eat i eat
pretty much anything else but um usually on the weekdays i won't eat until like 11 or 12
i just wouldn't eat breakfast noon yeah but then after that i fucking eat i gorge from like
five o'clock pm until like nine or ten yeah anything everything yeah my kids leftovers he's
like a leftover ham sandwich and some cereal on the ground i get everything yeah i literally eat
all of his left yeah i'm a garbage disposal too man like i fucking like 60 of my diets carbs
i just eat fucking pastas i eat the fucking bread i oh yeah i'll have a big bowl of soup
in a bread bowl with a baguette on the side and fucking you know i fucking smash i like i said
i eat whatever i want whenever i want everybody's different some shit works better for some people
some shit yeah i don't i don't limit myself to portion size or anything like that i eat my i usually
eat until i'm fucking till my belly hurts you know i mean so i'm fucking feeling a little bit sick
to be honest with you um yeah i don't like and it doesn't really affect me man it doesn't you know
like i stay 140 145 that's it like i can't you know i'll hit 150 155 if i start working out and
i'm doing the fucking weight gainer and the fucking creatine and all that shit but even that only
puts about 10 pounds on this creatine to make you add gain weight it puts water yeah it's water
weight i mean it makes you more rounder it puts water in your muscles and shit so it helps the
recovery time and fucking you look more rounder and fuller you know so it helps the everything
else you're doing but you know when i'm doing all that shit then i put like 10 12 pounds on me but
even though yeah man it's crazy if you ever try fasting uh you have a lot of power and energy
after you've done it for a few days man you get you get i don't know if i skip one meal dude i'm
fucking i don't know if i feel like i'm gonna fall out that's because you're addicted to food
we're addicted to food like the one thing that we are addicted to more than anything is food
fuck yeah like you know you really don't need food to survive there's a guy who fasted for like a
year without he didn't eat any food didn't eat any food for a year if you can find him Austin
was that to do with he's got all his energy from the sun he said he fucking laid out in the sun
he got all that fucking the vitamin d i think i read about this guy too i'm like yeah full of
shit no he's not full of shit dude three days three days without food three weeks without food you're
done it's you know okay yeah look this guy did one year and 17 days yeah look at him so you can get
all the nutrients you need and he was fucking probably 300 pounds and he just lived off of all
that's before and after it just melted off yeah he lived off of all that for the for however many
days it was right right i couldn't do that i'd be dead in a week so yeah so that's the difference
so when you start fasting your body goes into this this ketosis that's what the whole keto thing
just starts eating so now the energy metabolizing its own fucking you're burning you're burning fat
instead of carbohydrates so it just the fat melts off that's why people who are fat when they do
keto they lose weight really quick wow and you get you get better energy like more of a clean
burning energy when you're burning and so keto is what no carbs zero carbs pretty much no no
there's carbs but it's like there's like a there's like a percentage of your diet so only
like nine percent of your diet can be carbs um i think 30% protein and like 50% fat or 60% fat
or something like that but but my point was like like one of the guys i have in here is doctor who
studies um he just studies metabolic health and brain health his name is dom degstino he comes in
here he's fucking jacked dude massive fucking dude and he's a doctor at usf and he's a research
scientist and he studies how he does like research on mice um and he started doing it by
testing doing tests on navy seals navy seals who were getting oxygen toxicity oxygen toxicity
seizures from the rebreathers from like like trying to like you know go underwater undercover
without the bubbles and they were getting these these seizures and he was doing tests on them
with diet like seeing how they could avoid these seizures with different types of diets and he
found out about restricting carbs and putting them in ketosis they were getting rid of that and
then that kind of like transitioned into therapy for people who had epilepsy so people who like he
started testing it on epileptic people and then taking them off all their meds making them a
hundred percent keto and they were literally being cured of epilepsy no they were going from like
having multiple seizures a day to no seizures for months it's fucking crazy shit and then anyways
so he was telling me after like seven days of fasting he could deadlift something like 500
pounds like for 20 reps no shit like more than he normally does which is insane but yeah ketosis
shit's crazy i don't know if i can i don't know if i could do it i just i enjoy the fucking yeah i
enjoy i enjoy it so much i hate i hate matt matzo burt right now oh yeah yeah he doesn't do them
he doesn't do carbs at all not just drinks pure sugar from starbucks i i he survives on diet
sprite and fucking spoonfuls of peanut butter hey i love a spoonful of peanut butter i eat us at
least one spoonful of peanut butter a day maybe every other day that's kidding man
he's not kidding he's not happening he's debunking conspiracies he's debunking diets he's doing it
all listen i was i'm i'm still can i'm still convinced that was real oh my god oh i forget i
always forget about the fucking illuminati tattoo on the top of your head show me that again
that thing's fucking sick you all see hey what is that conspiracy theory speaking of
illuminati what's the conspiracy i just learned about it yesterday but i forget what it's called
it's like a god of reflections what there's like a name for it fuck what what's the premise
i don't even know but it's like it's supposed to be that's why i know exactly what that's it what
that is then no the god of reflection type in conspiracy that's matt narcissist yeah
but there's like a whole there's like a whole like crazy icon on he somehow it somehow ties into uh
free masonry i don't know no i'm i'm i'm fine what is it oh my god i didn't get the newsletter on
that one what is the moon house we definitely didn't go to the moon oh my god we definitely
didn't go to the moon matt did we go to the moon we went to the definitely not multiple we didn't
go to the fucking moon man you know that uh we sent three assholes up there in a tin can how the
fuck did they get through the fucking the the radiation belts that cut the van eisen radiation
belts god there was nothing to protect them from the radiation stop you're not a scientist and then
how do they they they tell it they in real time broadcast fucking their
their signal in their video to every person in america on live tv in the 60s it was
yeah from the moon oh my god are you telling me that there's thousands of scientists that
know how they're done but there's always one quack on youtube that says some bullshit and
certainly all these people like i knew it plenty of the flag there's no when the flag is moving in
the oh how did they do oh where's the stars we're oh stop i've watched this stop come on i've
watched all focus your time on something else i've watched them that's a great one matt what should
we spend our time on i don't know we're gonna i'm not i'm not convinced it was political it was
political uh documentaries i'm like it makes some good points what was it about they were
trying to beat the russians we were in it was the cold war but we didn't we were trying to beat
the russians to the moon and that you know we wanted to because america has to be first and
everything and that's what it was at that time we were just coming out of fucking world war two it
was fucking late it was late late 60s and there was this whole everything's american everything's
made here in america america number one i mean which we're living in the fucking zombie remnants
of that now which is overall horde and prostitute it out to the fucking corporations that's a
different fucking story but at that time that was the climate what did you have so we had to beat
fucking i told you why you don't even got the medals before we got down here we fucking
it was it was a space race man we had to be first it was political but we weren't first we weren't
we didn't have the first satellite we didn't put the first uh man into yeah into space when they had
that they had the first thinking about this though we were sitting we happened to land on the mood
first spot sputnik one we're sending a fucking regular citizens we're sending jeff bezos and uh
richard branson are getting are are flying into space for 20 years from now he'll be telling
that never happened but we haven't gone to the moon since we've gone to them in the first time
right then we only go once they said we lost the technology we didn't we didn't we think they said
we they said that we haven't we've said that nasa who said that nats chris nasa said that nasa
themselves said that we no longer have the technology to get to the moon it was lost
all of those programs the apollo program i'm telling you right now give it a goog pull it up
gosh dang tell me tell me where you have someone an employee current employee of nasa that said
we couldn't go to the moon right now we don't have the technology i think private yeah i think
private industry could get it because listen the rockets that we used to take that we i mean if they
put it together made a plan but we don't currently have one like there's no game plan you have to
have a plan there's no game plan like like the technology that took us to the moon the lunar
module and the fucking no they can't go jump in a ship and fly there right now no they're gonna
put something together right i was gonna click the list and why did we lose the ability to go
to the moon that's like me saying that i i i can't currently you know i can't currently fly no you're
right i don't have a jet in the parking lot i'm gonna have to go get hold on read this
matt will you read this in your nice voice no
come on go ahead read it no i'm not gonna read it that's gonna have to get it to read it to us
yeah why did we lose the ability to go to the moon this answer is true there were two accidents a
fire on the launch pad of apollo one that took the lives of three astronauts and an exploding oxygen
tank on apollo 13 that crippled the mission but those astronauts were able to return safely to
earth thanks to even more of team that's not why we're not really an answer to this question that's
nothing to do with it right but why haven't we gone why don't you think we've gone to the moon
since then what what year did we go to the moon 50 years ago 69 why the why they landed but they
landed in 69 but they've been so okay so we gotta you gotta think about nasa as like you
got so you have to think about nasa as like a just another branch of the government because
that's essentially what they are so when it comes down so they have all these programs put in the
place that are that have upkeep they you know what i mean like the rockets and you know all of the
programs in that that all the systems that are used for launch and all of the supporting systems
and all that shit these are all programs that they have in nasa and once one of those programs are
retired and they don't have a replacement program for that fucking that that whatever that that goal
then they just no longer have the technology because the okay the rockets that we used to get to the
moon in 69 were like apollo rockets they don't fucking use those rockets anymore that technology
they don't even have it what was the even the just the boot the rocket boosters themselves
they don't have the equipment they even like to upkeep the like the fucking technology you still
know the technology doesn't elon yeah it's work rockets from russia but he's a completely different
system like he they're using he's got his own engineers and shit working on like the rocket
boosters and the the way the fuel deliveries and everything they can't just go dig an apollo rocket
up and wheel it to the fucking launching pad and put it in the air like the systems used to even
launch those rockets don't even exist anymore because you know nasa's always putting new things
in the plane you've got the advent of everything was analog back then in 69 nothing was digital
everything was done analogs and fucking switches and relays we don't use switches and relays anymore
everything's fucking digital through wi-fi so you gotta think about it so now if they haven't sat down
and be like okay we need a plan to go to the moon then they just don't have a fucking plan to get
there it's not like just hopping into your Ferrari or your your car and driving do you think that if
they sat down over the weekend they could come up with a plan i mean yes absolutely or okay and
then it take them six months to a year to put the build maybe two years to build the rockets
to put it together but could we go to the moon in two years from now right now if the United
States government wanted to yes i'm gonna say yeah absolutely or so i feel we have been going that
was a 180 or a lot of people say 160 160 is not true that's a 180 that's a complete turnaround
360 man 360 sorry 360 a lot of people say 360 that's not sure it's a 180 so now you're saying
we can go you're just saying that right now they don't have the equipment or a plan to go right
oh of course now you don't keep that around because we don't need to go every every six months
but they could go they wanted to go to them also there's really no point of putting human beings
on the moon when they can just send these drones up there to fucking rover well they've checked it
out there's there's listen it's dead it's a rock well see what their plan was is it is it or what if
what if what if it's hollow hold on that's where all the Nazis went it's a Dyson and they're living
it's a Dyson sphere exactly they're living inside of a Dyson sphere which is the moon we just went
and seen a movie at the theater where that doesn't matter they're living inside that the moon was
actually a fucking alien spaceship and it was fucking it's been there since like the beginning
of time like this is just a recent movie that was just out actually moonfall it was called moonfall
because they there was some like like amateur astronomers that figured out the moon and kept
getting closer and closer but wait wait wait what what is the official narrative on how the moon
got there isn't it yes didn't we get hit by a giant this or there's two theories okay so there's
there's there what is like the accepted theory I know the mainstream the mainstream archeology
archeological theory is that they what's the non conspiracy theory that matt cox would exist well
there's no neither one of these are conspiracy theories this is both this is both mainstream
society mainstream science one was when the earth was in its early you know forming stages
I believe it's either a comet or an asteroid came and knocked off either split it in half
or knocked off a very large chunk of it and because of the way the the rotation of the earth
happens spinning it they were spinning they both created two bodies one being a satellite of the
earth and one being earth itself that's one theory the second theory is that the moon is just a
collection of debris left over from when the earth was forming not formed by like a giant
cataclysm with something actually hitting the earth and there's actually evidence for both because
a lot of the the dust and shit that they find on the moon is created from you know space dust and
like other rocks that that in other elements that aren't found here on earth I heard of the
theory that the theory that there was like another earth like an earth two that collided with this
earth and then created well that's part of his theory is basically they're saying the the formation
was that then when all of these different you know bodies were slamming each other that there were
two bodies that slammed and as they slung around one became you know as they're rotating one became
the earth and one was the moon it was just kept in its gravitational field and it kept
kept rotating that was it and then the moon became a satellite and they say that without the moon
life on earth wouldn't be possible right we wouldn't gravitation oh the create maybe vastly
different the you know it the the moon is tidal locked so the the rotation of the moon the rotation
of the earth is intrinsically synced with the you know the rotation of the moon and then
it was tidal actually it controlled the tides right on earth
it controls the good one that's a good one um yeah so like I said the moon you know we wouldn't be
here if it weren't for the moon I actually just walked a documentary we wouldn't be here if it wasn't
for jupiter yes jupiter sucks in all asteroids shields us from a lot of it's got insane gravity
yeah it was like 300 times the size of the earth or whatever right giant gas it's a gas giant
yeah and I just watched a documentary the other day they were talking about uh it was actually
it was one of those documentaries one of these videos I watch on youtube I followed on rabbit holes
it was about it was saying how it was there's like the rare life theory
where they're saying that life is either one of two things it's either extremely abundant abundant
in the in the solar system in the galaxy or it's extremely rare and that you know what we have
here on this earth is just like an extremely fucking random anomaly and not only that the
progression of like the human of us being able to you know think introspectively about our existence
you know about you know existentialism in itself it's saying that it's it's even more rare than that
and there's evidence for both you know I had Randall Randall you know Randall Carlson is I do
yeah I talked to him about and he was telling me about one of the theories that he thinks
I mean I don't know if he was just explaining one of the popular theory what
oh did he yeah I'm gonna say and he didn't say not to talk about he he didn't say that he believed
this but he was talking about a theory that was explained to him that the moon was man made
I don't know the details of it I'm sure you find a youtube video on it right but um he's a freemason
and what's it made out of the freemason cheese
yeah I don't I don't know I mean I don't know what could he made out of
I mean I'm not so real I mean the aliens could have put it here just because they knew that if
they put that giant you know whatever here that hey whatever happened that's their base there was
an article that came out a couple months ago that there were the Chinese Chinese version of NASA
found like a black structure on the moon and they were on the dark side of the moon in one of the
craters yeah they they found like a box looking structure and they were sending out they were
sending out a rover to go find it and they said it's gonna take a month to get there can you find
that did you what did you did I show you this that Chris sent me about this zooming in on the moon
this guy they zoom in zoom in this guy this is gonna be like a gag no it's gonna be the guy
no no this is this is chris like chris chris believes this like see the little thing right there
watch the dick pop up that's not a dick what are you doing
you know these tiktoks are so are I know it looks so real and basically what I told Chris was I said
so it's somebody who's skydiving on the moon what's the big deal chris and he was like yeah it's
alien skydiving on the moon is that what you're saying I said yeah it's fucking aliens what's the
problem what's your issue with with aliens and Chinese rover spot yeah this is it when was this
published December 7th yeah this is when it was published it was a couple months ago December
or three or four months ago there's a picture of yeah that see that thing that was like
everyone thing in Matt's video that was gonna say but man that's fuzzy but they said they said it's
always just out of frame and fuzzy they were gonna send something over there to go check it out and
then there was their joggers I never saw anything after that that's awesome this we're bound to find
something I mean could you imagine if if if different countries populate the moon like
didn't like six months ago they say that look there are there are there are UFOs like they came out
like like they came out and said look they're UFOs these things are flying around our jets we see
them they went in the ocean we don't know what they're there's a theory about that nobody said shit
there's a theory that that they're just saying that because that's their their shit and they
don't want everybody to know that they have that their government or whoever like these they have
the technology so they're like yeah it's UFOs you guys okay even even if they guys are absolutely
right we don't know what we don't know what we don't know what these things are okay so even if
they said that they outmaneuver our fucking part right even if they did they did just say they're
UFOs yes so you're saying that the government just said hey they're UFOs they're moving very fast
we don't know what they are yes this is how fast they're going they just admitted it there wasn't
massive panic they people government admitted something yeah are you serious whatever the
government admits yeah the opposite is probably true okay so if they said they don't know what they are
then they definitely they probably definitely know what the fuck they are if they're saying we don't
know what they are they appear to be UFOs we don't know so what what's the opposite tell me what
happened I think that it's technology that the United States has their hands on in their testing
okay that's what I think either way that's again you guys are missing the point either way
Jesus how is not you're not either way they're saying there are UFOs so what I'm saying is they
just said hey there are UFOs people didn't have massive panic they didn't go nuts people didn't
stop paying their bills yeah but so I mean but I mean the society's pretty fucking jaded here in
2022 right so why from all this shit that's going on well if if imagine if on the front page of the
New York Times they showed a fucking flying saucer landing on the lawn of the white front
lawn of the White House and they showed him the fuck they showed I think people would still pay
their mortgages I think they'd still go to go to work you still have jerkoffs going to work every day
yeah absolutely like fuck that I'm out of here I think there'd be more YouTube videos what do you
think would change nothing I don't think rogan would do it would do a would do a couple of podcasts
I think that uh I I do one I yell at him to do one and he'd say I'm not doing anything trending
I'm not doing it all these jackoffs on YouTube doing it I'm not doing it Alex Jones would do one
I'm gonna yell about how these people treated me it when I flew I bucked I bucked the system right
so he wouldn't do it you and you'd get somebody on here scientists to talk about it but in the
end I think everybody would wash their cars and take their kids it's like that movie it's like
that movie don't look up yeah have you seen that oh yeah such a great fucking good movie
such a great movie funny as fuck yeah it was good I think I think people would uh I think it'd be
like 9-11 when everyone became like super patriotic and like everyone was like pro america no there
wasn't all this like divided like trump versus the woke I think everyone would yeah start to become
a little bit more level headed for a little bit and then they go nuts biden would they'd have to
walk biden out on the yard and show them where the where it is that what is what is that I think
if we set in force two or one no if we had our aliens if we realized that where there was like
another threat like an existential threat outside of the earth we would kind of team together a
little bit more than we are now for sure yeah that's not even possible like the idea that aliens
would come down here no we're not ready that we're not ready yet yeah but I mean like what would
like if you could get to the earth from across the galaxy or universe then what like we're not much
of a threat like you've got all of our problems beat I think they're waiting to come down I think
they're waiting to reveal themselves to us and I think they check on us every once in a while and
then they'll come down and they'll see boziak tattooing some girls asshole they say not ready
they're not ready yet they're not ready it's like when you're baking cookies in the oven and you're
checking in nope nope 10 more minutes yeah they're like these monkeys just figured out how to split
the atom you know I mean we're gonna blow they're gonna blow themselves up I think that's why
they're coming I have I have a new proposition okay okay I say we need to start a go fund me
and if that go fund me can hit a $10,000 I will get Danny and hat racks face tattooed on my ass
cheeks nice we're not doing a go fund me okay well we'll do a youtube live is that how we're not
gonna fucking scan people out of go fund me because you know go fund me took all the truckers money
right well no because not if you're up front exactly about what you're not supporting the goddamn
go fund me what truckers oh the canadian truckers oh they get a piece of that don't they there was
a whole go fund me set up to support the truckers and there was a lot forget how much money there
was I think it was close to a hundred thousand or even a million dollars that was donated to
support the canadian truckers because they don't want to get vaccinated because they fucking drive
in a truck all right no we're not doing that as in we're not doing the tattoos we're not doing
go fund me no he didn't like go fund me go fund me didn't like the cause or whatever I don't know
whatever happened but they thought it wasn't moral it was political and they took the fucking money
no way okay once again I cannot imagine that they just took a million dollars okay they got okay
they had to get threatened by the government okay for from for fraud and I guess it looks like that
they were the refunding did they refund everybody yeah why I'd like 10 million in donations
listen first of all I'd like to say I'm the voice of reason here I'm not not you because you
don't say anything crazy but between these two I feel like I'm the voice of reason and that bothers
me when I'm the voice of reason how bad is it what do you mean voice of reason like he's like they
took a million dollars they didn't take it like I don't even know what this is let's find out what
actually happened immediately if we find out they refunded it you know he you know we can't get to
the moon we can't we don't have the technology we can never go we don't we lost this no but basically
we just because we don't have the currently have the rockets right well yeah we could go well let's
see did they refund the money let's find out what did Ron DeSantis say it is fraud for go fund me
to commandeer nine million dollars in donations sent to support the truckers and give it a cause of
their choosing I will work with so they're being able to investigate these the deceptive practices
these donors should be given a refund so they had to fight governors of fucking states had to
fucking tweet and fight tweeted to get the money back the money back they refunded they went 10
million they were like he had to fucking type this tweet on his phone so listen oh my god
I mean literally like on a Monday they get a tweet and they're like look we have 90 days to return
the money we're gonna we were planning on returning it anyway relax calm down and they returned it
right so we're not using go fund me then so we're not that's why we're not that's why you're not
because because they have a they probably have a certain I don't think we should use go fund me
okay I don't listen I I look I didn't even watch your your names are I just thought that was
no we're not doing names we're doing full portraits baby full color portraits oh yeah full
color portraits listen we don't have to use go fund me fuck go fund me I just that's the de facto
go to for we can set up a patreon tier it's crowdfunding set up a patron here okay where it's
whatever a thousand bucks two thousand bucks whatever it might be for a tattoo what if you
don't reach it what are we gonna read when it comes to 9500 which I think is more like I'm tattooing
my ass cheeks if it's 9500 not 10 who would you tattoo on your ass cheeks who would you like me to
tattoo on my ass he just said he was doing me and you yeah for 10 g's for 10 g's where we are well
we gotta figure out the patreon tiers and we gotta you gotta label them and you gotta put the price
on it and then we can either do that or we could do donations live on youtube on youtube live
we're in i mean i'll promote it nobody watches my channel but i'll promote it what's that
would the tattoo gun be mobile enough to put in here and like it's wireless oh it's wireless
you're okay with this i got bad mind battery okay i'm just making sure fuck yeah dude i want to
yeah it's not it's not like a fucking giant i'll get a tattoo live on the podcast if someone
donates enough money okay i'll tattoo you live on the i gotta actually i have a tattoo that i want
to get already so we could start with that one and then we can do other side ones for money yeah
a horn is it is it a blimp another blimp no it's not okay what is it you guys checked out my
instagram yeah my tattoo instagram not recently but i have seen it yeah boziak conundrum anything
new the boziak dot i and k i have a whole new one oh do you really what's your new instagram
pull it up just boziak dot i and k boziak dot i and k yep
oh yeah i didn't i didn't follow that one um it's tight
anyways what was i saying i was thinking about earlier you did all these yeah see yeah it's all
my work what if on the moon all these countries like russia china and the us we like established
our own bases on the moon the moon is so fucking tiny it'd be dope there's no borders on the moon
yeah so what the fuck would that look like it'd be dope would there be straight up fucking battles
and wars going on hell yeah there would be that's like that movie with brad pit yeah astronaut yeah
it was like the wild west out there shooting at each other how fucking insane that was a great
that was a great fucking scene right yeah they're fucking shooting at him on the one guy gets
face blasted that dude that fell asleep when i was tattooing his face that's him yeah
damn that guy's fucking psycho bro what went wrong in his life this guy it's just
like how bad was his childhood yeah he was fucking he was a character
but yeah man i did uh i have been closer dope time hell yeah i like him thanks man
keep going i'm thinking about trying to get into a shop out here in tampa uh florida somewhere
there's a lot around here a lot of tampa too yeah if you guys know anybody uh where do you live
right now i'm like out in like the north tampa like out towards westley chapel okay this is better
than fucking lakeland where matt cox lives lakeland i live in westley chapel
oh no you live in lakeland my bad
yeah a little something something i'm not like i'm not like i'm not like the baddest dude ever
but you know what i do i try and do it super clean so yeah those are dope i like i need a boziak
tattoo yeah we need to get some boziak tattoos bro i'm down dude i'll bring all my equipment
next time hell yeah dude well i was gonna ask you matt what do you think about what do you think
about you see like or you what do you think about you see shit like putting ass putting people on
the moon fucking elon shooting these rockets into space trying to buy shit like twitter i mean listen
those are power moves by fucking billionaires those are billionaire power moves and then okay
they're power moves but even even like fucking moats art or or michael angelo salvador dolly
the empire state building kanya west i'm dying to see how all of the most all of the most insane
human innovations in the history of the world sure what if it's all just an elaborate mating ritual
what's i'm listen i have an hour and a half drive a mating ritual yeah what if it's a it's
like a peacock i get tired like a peacock has this fucking beautiful broad extravagant display of
for breeding all it is is to attract a mate what if all this crazy shit is that's all it is it's
just an elaborate fucking mating call that us monkeys do to impress other monkeys to what
you have a you have a point no to attract them fucking mate you have a point at the very base
level of everything is really but we just come up with a backstory of meaning we create our own
backstory that has some elaborate meaning that we attached to it we're all trying to get laid
we're all just trying to fuck further the species on some like you're talking about like at some
primal level yeah yeah i get it what do you think about that theory that thinks it's funny it's
bullshit i get it it's bullshit i i i in on some level i i'm sure that that's a huge part of it
i or a part of it yeah you know what what is that pyramid we talked about the pyramid before where
the first part of the pyramid is just trying to kind of be safe and then the next the next
higher level is to kind of you know you want security is that mazlo and then yeah there's
another level is like you know about having like future security and the next level is kind of about
your legacy and the next level you know it's that fuck that pyramid what about the pyramid of
consciousness i don't know anything about i don't really know even the name of the first pyramid
i was talking about that's mad i think this mazlo's hierarchy you're talking about what is this guy
doing makes a lot of sense can he pull that what are you pulling up the what happened to the pyramid
we're talking the pyramid like he doesn't pull anything nobody's paying attention all these people
want to go home the guy you're paying to work that this the switches what about like the period
what about like the all these fucking bots that live on twitter like what percentage of tweets
that you read are fucking are just bots yeah i don't know i was just a race i don't read to do the
crypto people get into your comment section bro it's insane i trade with with john johnson oh
john's wonderful he made me hundreds of thousands of dollars oh i know john he just cashed yeah yeah i go
in there and just a right remove remove yeah it's insane it whether it's crypto whether it's politics
whether whatever it is if you type out a certain thing and talk about a certain thing whether it's
politics or crypto you're gonna get all these fucking comments with the same fucking thing yeah
there's so many fucking bots they say it comes from russia a lot of it comes from russia well
there's a russian farms what's that lady's name who talks who did that ted talk no yeah yeah yeah
what's her name rene d'arresta talks about there's like even in saudi arabia saudi arabia is one of
the biggest what was it the king of saudi rate or the kingdom of saudi arabia they were the biggest
group that fought back against elon taking over twitter they did not want elon to take over twitter
because he's like all you know he wants to make it more balanced in china they have state sponsored
hacking right were they just fun they buy buildings and they just pack it full of people
that are on computers 24 hours a day trying to hack into everything in america they died they
indicted a bunch of those guys yeah a ton of ton of those guys they died that's the problem what
that's the problem with with free speech on twitter where do you draw the line like what was the
purpose of the free speech aren't what was the purpose of well there isn't a line for free speech
right there is because they have they have a community they have community guidelines there's
rules they have to follow for who who are you talking about for china for twitter for twitter
yeah there's there's like it's supposed to be free speech but the reason that they ban people is
for reasons right they're trying to avoid doxing they're trying to avoid like real calls for violence
on yeah i was gonna say i could see violence to me violence would really probably be the only
thing that i could say hey look you just can't advocate violence like at that point i'd be good
and that was there that was their ultimate reason for banning trump right they're saying
that he is side of the january six riots or whatever yeah it would have to be pretty specific
violence you'd have to pretty be pretty for me to say listen we gotta wipe we can't you can't say
that like i would have to be pretty specific not that whole what he said was very vague so the whole
trump band shit was fucking wild man like if you think about it dude that's the wildest fucking
shit ever of president getting a do get because that right there lets you know that
people who run these companies are part of you know a particular fucking agenda and a part of a
particular fucking side of the political fucking you know what i mean like that's obvious for sure
it's fucking straight fucking obvious when something like that happens it's like okay then
there is an agenda and there is fucking some kind of a ulterior fucking motive here you know and it's
just like what the fuck yeah that's insanity that's pure fucking insanity that that's happening
and the other there's a lot of others like mylo enopolis getting banned the other person who got
banned i forget who it was but some are some person tweeted a man is not not a woman or something like
that they got banned fired immediately suspended from twitter permanently yeah um it's crazy this
guy i know this guy i know this political commentator kid uh that that posts a lot of shit on youtube um
kyle kolinsky he posted replying to some sort of political tweet from somebody like like mocking
the dude and then posted that gif of the head exploding you know the gif from that movie it's
like a it's a gif of like this guy with a clay head and his head just explodes and it's like clearly
like clay fake animatronic or like special effects right and they they fucking blocked it and suspended
his twitter profile saying that it was like depicting acts of violence or whatever but you
can find a million other tweets using that same fucking gif yeah but it's because this guy's like
a left leaning commentator or whatever i mean they enforce the rules when and how they want to
on who they choose to period that's all part of it it's all part of it suspicious like like but then
there's board trying to block elan from from buying it yeah it's suspicious because what is he gonna
find like is there something that he could find that he would expose that goes deep like really deep
i don't know maybe i don't even know if it's that deep i think that they just they don't
they don't want to they don't want him to change what they got going on they don't need that kind
of ink on sugar mountain you know what i'm talking about they don't they don't need it they don't
fucking they got what they did got what they're trying to do you know what i'm saying they got
what they're trying to do and he knows that they're you're gonna come in and he's gonna
fucking fuck their shit up yeah why would they wanna sell it to us why would it matter when
they're gonna make all that money i mean his the the price that he offered for share i don't think
I think it's about the money.
And what is it about?
It's about their agenda.
It's about control.
It's about their agenda.
Yeah, it's about their agenda.
Why is their agenda so much more important than making millions and millions of dollars?
Because people that own Twitter are already multi-multi-multi-millionaires.
They're already, you know, once you've got it.
The agenda's all part of it.
So they don't think, like, so they think they have some agenda that is so moral and
so just that it is more important to make a guess.
Might not be moral and just.
Yeah, I wouldn't say it's an agenda.
Maybe in their opinion they think so, yeah.
In their mind it must be.
Yeah.
Maybe.
But there's a difference between if you have, like, you know, you're worth two trillion
and you're worth three trillion.
You do understand that it's not like you get a bigger car.
Like nothing really changes.
There was a study done and they said after about, like, 70 or 80,000 or 170 or something
like that thousand dollars a year, your life doesn't really improve.
Like you're fucking your state of well-being, your means.
It doesn't really improve up to that point.
You know, so like a lot of these people, they're just not motivated by the money anymore.
The money.
They got all the money.
It's just not even about that.
It's like they live through some altruistic.
They think that their view of the world is altruistic and that it's the only way.
And they want to push that on people.
And yeah, it's a mental illness.
But it seems like.
It's a literal fucking mental illness.
But it doesn't seem like it's, it doesn't feel like, it's like, nah, we don't want them
to do it.
Our answer is no.
They panicked and went to an extreme to block it.
But, okay, so why say somebody that's more left leaning and more liberal does the same
exact thing and has no zero consequences?
Or for granted, they do something even way crazier.
Like they'll say something way fucking more wild than that.
You know what I mean?
They'll make some fucking kind of like, some feminist will say fucking all white men need
to die or all women need to abort male babies.
And that's just fucking allowed to float around on Twitter.
Those people don't get taken off, but he says something that can be misconstrued and all
of a sudden now he's down and fucking barred from the platform.
Come on, man.
Come on.
It's a fucking obvious.
It's obvious.
Yeah, it is obvious, but it's wild, man.
There's so many different variables.
I mean, there's like, so there's a lot of different moving parts.
Like Saudi Arabia.
And at the end of the day.
What do you do about Saudi Arabia?
What do you do about countries that you can't, you can't tell Saudi Arabia they're not going
to use bots and they're not going to ban people for saying shit.
I mean, at the end of the day, it's a private corporation.
It's not a public utility.
It's a private corporation that they can pretty much do whatever they want with their product.
Whether you know, and it's just because of the way things are.
It's like the de facto public square for people to communicate.
And it's like, what do you do?
Did he say he wanted to take it private?
He said if he bought it, he would take it private.
What was the point of him taking it private?
It's a publicly traded company.
It's publicly traded, but he said he wanted to make it private.
If he bought it, if he bought it outright, he would, he said that's the only way to fix
it.
Because you know, because then you wouldn't have to be beholden to your, your share
members, your share holders.
What are you like?
Yeah.
You don't have, you're not beholden to your shareholders.
Like you don't have to have a board of directors that keeps coming in and saying, look, we're
not making money.
We have to do this.
We have to do that.
We have to do this.
If it's just a private owner.
The board is the only ones that have the board.
You're legally obligated to make money for your investors.
You have to, Jack, Jack Dorsey, or Dorsey, Jack Dorsey just tweeted something.
He tweeted something crazy like two days ago or yesterday about the board of directors.
And he was saying how this is like some fucking crazy fraud movie that he's going through.
It's like the board, what he's witnessed over the past 10 years in Twitter.
He's like, there has to be some sort of Hollywood thriller made about this because there's like
these coups that are happening within the company.
Yeah.
What did he say?
Find the exact quote for what he said.
Try to click the New York post.
Jerkoff takes cold showers every day.
He does.
Jack Dorsey rips.
Keep going.
Yeah.
He said, it's consistently been the dysfunction of the company, Dorsey said.
Later when he asked about another user, if he was allowed to say this, he replied, no.
In another tweet, Dorsey responded to the user who quoted the venture capitalist Fred
Destin as praising the Silicon Valley proverb.
Good boards don't create good companies, but a bad board will kill a company every time.
Keep going down.
Big facts, he said.
He said something about like a Hollywood thriller and like coups happening.
Yeah, man.
I'm sure there's all kinds of internal shit going on there.
People are fucking fighting it.
I'm really happy Elon is joining the Twitter board.
He cares to be.
He didn't join the board.
That was the first tweet.
That's when he said he was buying like 10% or whatever.
And then he purposely didn't join the board because when you're a board member, you can't
own more than 15% of the company.
Anyways, but he said there's like a bit a lot of fucking crazy shit happening on the
inside.
So that company, whatever.
And it's like, he was really stoked on Elon doing it, but yeah, I mean, listen, I think
it's a good move.
But you know, he's got to figure out how to get that much, that much money.
He's got a lot going on.
Now he's trying to fucking take over Twitter and go to fucking Mars.
How's he going to get big tunnels underneath the earth and fucking Jesus Christ, man.
How would he get $40 billion?
You don't have to get 50 what you only have to get a certain percentage and get some other
guys to go along with.
He's got that and probably fucking in stock and fucking in Tesla.
How much stock we have to sell to get $45 billion?
That's a good question.
How many soches do you need to get 40 billion?
The population of a small country.
Are we done?
Are we done, Matt?
We got Matt's fucking over it.
I got to drive an hour.
I got to drive an hour.
Should we end it?
Is there any conspiracy theories you do kind of believe in a little bit?
I don't think the things that I believe in are conspiracy theories.
They're just true.
Matt doesn't spend any of his time.
Is there any interesting things out there that you know, maybe that could be true.
Because I, you know, honestly, it's like I have, what's the most important thing in
your life, Matt?
I mean, what do you mean?
What's the most important thing in your life?
I mean, to be happy.
What makes you happy?
I mean, spending time with my girlfriend makes me happy.
Painting makes me happy.
Writing makes me happy.
Why painting and writing?
I like doing the pot, my podcast, you know, I like hanging out with people that I like
hanging out with.
Number one is your girlfriend.
Yeah.
Number two is painting and writing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why the painting and writing?
Because it makes money.
You realize like working out is like not even on the top 10.
I'm not talking about working out.
I hate working out.
I'm talking about like the reading and writing.
Why do you like the painting and the writing?
It's just, it's creative.
It's like, you know, it's like...
It's an expression.
Yeah.
You just like to zone out.
You ever mow your own yard mowing my own yard?
Right.
That's one of my favorite things to do.
Yeah.
No, is it?
Really?
I love watching the TikToks.
You send me some clips.
I watch them on Instagram and on TikTok, the fucking guys who make these perfect fucking
lawns.
I could watch that shit.
I didn't know any of this, by the way.
For hours.
I didn't know any of this.
That's what I do late at night.
I look at that shit.
Whenever people say like, you know...
Lawn porn.
Yeah.
Whenever people say like, do you like painting?
And they're like, why do you like painting?
Because I love when you kind of, when you're completely done and you step back and you
look at it and you're like, wow, like I did that.
Like look at that.
Like I feel this, this great feeling, feeling of fulfillment.
And so like that's when you finish something, you're like, wow, I can't believe I did that.
And whenever people are like, well, I don't really, I don't know what you mean.
And I would say, do you mow your own yard?
And then they go, yeah, I do.
How do you feel when you completely done, stop the mower, turn around and look?
How do you feel?
It's like a fucking Michelangelo.
Right.
It's great.
It's a great feeling.
Like that's really, for someone who doesn't paint or write, they don't understand that.
But if you say, did you mow your yard and they're like, or even paint a room.
They're like...
That feeling of accomplishment.
Yeah, I know what you're mean.
I know what you're mean.
Because you don't get that doing someone's taxes.
I don't think you get that if you work in the warehouse.
No.
But I think...
I don't even get that when I edit like a video.
I fucking hate it.
I was going to say, maybe...
I was going to say, maybe...
I was thinking maybe that would work, but no, it doesn't, because it's fucking torture
editing videos.
I hate it.
Yeah.
It's long and arduous.
And then when you're done, it's like...
And you never really feel good, like at that first thing.
No.
You're staring at this fucking screen, sitting in a chair.
But when you edit one...
When you're mowing a lawn, you're fucking out in the sun.
It's a clear...
You're clearly done.
You're getting exercise.
You can have your headphones in, listen to a fucking audio book.
You learn.
You get exercise.
You get the vitamin D, and you're fucking creating this beautiful lawn.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It sounds stupid.
It's so fulfilling.
Zen.
It's so fulfilling.
Not only is Zen, but it's extremely productive.
What about washing your car?
You kind of get that washing.
I hate washing my car.
See, I think some people...
See, I'm the opposite.
I'll bet you some people get that washing in their car.
I love it.
Some people are like, I hate...
I don't get that in the yard, but most people, if you're lucky, you have something like that
in your life.
Yeah.
Washing your car's close.
I do it every week.
I would do it twice a week if I had the need to.
Yeah.
When I was really obsessed with my car, when I was younger, I used to do it every week.
But see, I don't really like my car.
Right.
You know, if I was driving a Lamborghini, I'd probably be like, wash that fucker.
You know what I'm saying?
But now it's like, you know, today...
If you were driving a Lamborghini, you wouldn't give a fuck.
You're just pacing a kid to wash it.
Yeah, Matt wouldn't...
True.
Wash his own car if it was a Lamborghini.
I would wash...
Get me a Lamborghini.
Let's find out.
But then when we were painting, and I threw that painting up on the hood of my car, I
was like, it's great not giving a shit about your car.
Like, I wanted the sun to bake the painting and make it dry right away.
I took it out and just popped it on top of my car and walked back in the garage.
Yeah.
But yeah.
So yeah, I like painting.
I like writing.
I like painting.
Especially writing.
And it's all about the feeling that you get all about that zen sort of accomplishment
feeling.
Yes.
Or is money involved in that at all?
No, because I don't really make a bunch of money.
You don't do it for money.
I don't make a bunch of money.
Like, no one thing pays my bills.
Like, I make some money on books, sales.
I don't even push my book sales.
I make some money on painting.
I make some money on doing commercials and podcasts and things being interviewed.
So I make a little here, a little here.
And luckily by then in the month, I'm able to pay my bills.
And of course, that's helping me try and put together some documentaries and work on different
projects.
And I'm hoping those projects end up being something and making some money.
But right now, I'm super happy.
When you're writing, is it a similar process to the painting?
Is it mindless?
Or do you have to sit there and really think?
No.
It's way different.
Because I just, I'll sit there for two hours and write three sentences.
And other times I'll sit down and I'll write two pages in an hour.
So it's just totally just...
How structured is it?
Like, how much work is it?
Do you sit there and be like, hmm, maybe this sentence should be here.
Absolutely.
Maybe I should use this word instead.
Do you sit there and think like, hmm, what work?
Listen, I hit the this R.
I hit the synonym, synonym, synonym, synonym.
This R is okay.
What about this?
Then I go and it's...
And this is right.
If you're working on a project, is this just like writing because it's a ritual just to
write?
No.
I write almost every day now.
Like I did for months and months and months.
What is your daily writing consist of?
You know, just different stories that I'm working on.
Okay.
So stories that you're working on.
Like just write out thoughts or ideas or...
No.
No.
Plus you...
Like journaling or like diary...
Like journaling about what happened.
No.
It's always stories.
It's always someone's story.
You know, I'm...
Pete and I, my buddy, Pete, we've been working on something for God over what?
Since I left prison, like two years, we've been working on a story about this.
These guys, the chip heist I told you about.
And, you know, the Chinese guys that were robbing all of these chip manufacturers and
sending the chips back to China back in the 90s.
But, you know, we've been working on that.
I'm working on one about me being in prison in a...
About a book I wrote in a lawsuit and get now.
And then there's, you know, and then I'm working on Jess's story right now because she's got
actually a great story.
She just hates to talk about it.
So I'm ordering documents and that sort of thing.
So I'm always kind of working on...
I get up early.
I work for a couple of hours.
Sometimes I write three sentences.
Sometimes it's a page.
You know, if you do it a little bit every day and then one day I'll turn around.
I'll go, oh my God, it's good.
I think it's done.
I'll let a few people read it and I'll go, holy shit, I think this is done.
Do you feel more creative about doing your...
Or more motivated to do your work after you go to the gym early?
Or does that make a difference?
No, that doesn't make any difference.
It doesn't make any difference.
I feel more motivated after I've had two cups of coffee.
Two cups of coffee, yeah.
I feel that.
What's up with your...
Don't you have some sort of like documentary coming out, John?
Are they working on shopping some sort of show for you or something?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What's up with that?
They're just trying to get it all figured out right now.
I was going to say I was waiting for...
Like to me, I'm always like, they're signing this.
They're doing this.
Like I know what's happening the whole way through.
And when I say to him and if you mention it to him, he's like, well, take it forever.
Well, what's that?
Well, I'm like, it takes time.
I know what happened.
Yeah, I get it.
I get it.
It's just one of those things where it's like, you know, you get to a certain point and then
there's negotiations and then they get to another certain point and then there's negotiations
and then there's more negotiations and then sometimes it gets fucking just sit somewhere
and doesn't do anything for four or five weeks and then all of a sudden you get a fucking
text message and you're like, okay, we're moving on this.
We're moving on that.
So it's just like...
I don't know.
At least it didn't tie you up and make you like...
No, it's definitely happening.
The wheels are turning.
Things are happening.
You know, so stuff's getting signed and scheduling...
Can we watch the trailer or the sizzle they made?
I don't know.
Really?
He'll go nuts.
You've seen it.
Like you've seen it.
You know, I was like, no, the guy that's doing it, he'll go nuts.
Do you understand that?
You understand that anything...
Fuck him!
Fuck him!
No.
Yeah.
Anything he posts, like they are all over him.
Do my social media.
If I post something that's even kind of like can be considered sketchy like racist or fucking
anything...
Anything they can take out of context.
The director gives him a call?
They don't even call him anymore.
Yeah.
Well, they...
They're done calling him because he argues.
They call me.
You've got to call him.
Listen, I don't...
He's got to take that post out.
You've got to take that.
I'm like, well, I don't...
What post did they actually take out?
Oh, quite a few.
Yeah, there's been quite a few.
And they never mean anything.
Like he...
The head.
What was the head?
One, I had like a giant clown head on my helmet.
Like head...
Can we see this?
Do you want to save on your phone?
Yeah, I have it on my phone.
But they were trying saying...
They were trying like, oh, that's a racist.
They were saying it looks like it's urine and blackface, but it wasn't.
It's a clown head from...
From what's his name?
Rob Zombie Movie.
That happens to be...
Is the guy black or brown?
It's just a brown head.
It's not even...
I don't think it's even...
Yeah, so...
No, take it down.
It looks bad.
It just doesn't look right.
It doesn't look...
It looks bad.
That was the photo you posted.
Yeah, I had to take it down.
That's not the only one.
There's been multiple ones.
And I'll show you another one I had to take down.
Well, it's still up.
Yeah, it's all...
No, it's archive.
Oh, it's archive.
Yeah, I didn't take it out.
Because I'm just going back up.
So they think the people that are trying to sell this fucking document, they think they're...
I had to take that one down, too.
Well, you know, they're...
Bro, they're always concerned.
Even though...
Oh, because that's supposed to be...
What's that supposed to mean?
White power?
White power?
I didn't know that.
This is what I do.
Yeah, first of all, that's not...
It's a sign that they're taking and twisting.
Yeah.
You know?
Does that really mean white power is out there?
I don't know.
That's like me saying, okay.
You know?
Yeah.
That means white power.
Shut up.
Yeah, so, you know, I don't know.
Yeah, so...
Everything is...
What is the reason?
Do they explain to you why they wanted to take it down?
I'm under a microscope.
Even...
They don't want me to fuck up any potential and sell it to a Netflix.
They don't want to be like, okay, because they're going to tell somebody about me, the people
are going to look into me, and they're going to go to my Instagram and be like, wait a minute,
what about this post right here?
These executives at these networks are super fucking sensitive.
Right.
Any kind of shit like that.
It doesn't matter that it's...
I'm like, well, they better not go and watch my fucking YouTube channel then.
Bro, please post a make America...
You should award a Make America Great Again hat on this podcast.
Oh, Nike is crucified for that.
And that's not even really like...
If I were to do it just to ruffle feathers, but that's not really...
Right.
But the whole thing is like, he's not a racist person.
These aren't racist things.
They're like, yeah, but they could be construed as it's like, oh my God.
Are you serious?
Dude, imagine how much that fucking sucked to have your whole livelihood based on these
fucking political ideologies.
Yeah.
So that's how I'm living right now.
And you should hear...
So I can't really go nuts how I want to.
On our group chats?
I can't...
I go fucking...
Go nuts.
You understand our group chats?
Like I say stuff like...
I'm going to say one of the mundane ones.
They'll say, hey, we're waiting for so-and-so to respond.
We sent them an email.
We're waiting for the response.
And I say, hey, listen, do you have this guy's address?
Because I'll get a couple of Mexicans to go throw them in the trunk of their car, drive
around for a couple of hours, duct tape them to a chair.
We're in a group chat with like eight people working on this film.
Right.
Duct tape them to a chair and then we'll have a conversation just to soften them up.
Do you remember the one?
And so...
Wait, wait, wait.
None of them respond.
He's laughing.
That's funny.
We're going back and forth.
You understand?
It's like text, text, text, text.
And then I say that.
Boom.
Dead silent.
For like 15 minutes.
And then all of a sudden I just get like...
I'll get like...
I don't even want to say his name.
I'll get like the emoji with just the big eyes.
Yeah.
Like that.
What about the one where he's like...
You're terrified.
He's like, okay, so...
They sent us a picture of this dude and like, we're pitching to this dude or we're trying
to get this guy signed on board.
So I just dump on.
I do a quick Google search of the guy.
Apparently he has some kind of wild fucking sex charges against them or something.
No, no.
It was that he had been sued by an intern.
An intern.
Yeah.
A female intern had sued him for sexual harassment.
Yeah.
And I'm like, so I pull up the news article.
This is one of the guys who works in production.
No, no, no, no.
They were pitching.
They were talking to.
Yeah, they were talking to him and they're like, we're trying to get him involved.
So then I sent the news article in the fucking...
In the thing.
He goes, is this the guy?
Right.
Yeah.
Is this the guy in the fucking...
Oh, I came back and then they were like, oh, well, maybe we should reconsider talking
to him.
I guess it's not...
I guess we're not going to approach him.
That doesn't sound like someone we want to deal with.
And I go, well, wait a second.
What does she look like?
I said, let's not jump to conclusions here, bro.
I said, this may have been a perfectly reasonable sexual harassment.
I said, sometimes it's just good behavior.
So I'm going back and forth.
Listen, we're talking about, that's like a phone call like, hey, listen, those are the
kinds of things that you say in a chat and they come back to you five years later.
It's a joke.
But then again, we have nothing to lose.
They work on huge projects with these massive fucking multi conglomerate companies.
Billion dollar companies.
They can't.
Big time budgets and shit.
They can't even comment.
People were getting fucked up over tweets from five years ago.
So I can only, somebody publishes the chull chain of fucking chats that's going off and fucking...
Yeah.
They're not stupid enough to comment.
We're terrifying.
Yo, yeah.
I'm a loose cannon.
They're fucking terrified of me just sinking this whole goddamn thing.
Fucking...
Can you please just call him?
Just call him?
Oh my God, dude.
Yeah.
They think I'm going to torpedo the whole thing before it even gets legs.
So they're just trying to fucking...
That's why I don't really post or like...
I go crazy on my podcast sometimes when I probably shouldn't about a lot of shit.
But my social media, I kind of don't really...
I don't really fuck around.
That is...
I don't want to shoot myself in the foot.
I want to read some of those group chats.
Oh, it's funny.
I was like, maybe we should get Harvey Weinstein involved.
He fucking...
I was like, he...
I was like, he fucking gets bangers going.
He would have had this thing.
Billion been released by now.
I saw Harvey in there.
Oh yeah, dude.
They didn't know that at all.
These fucking...
And these are all like well-to-do.
They're sense of humor is real dry.
It's not like, you know...
Not like they're in the gut or like ours is, you know what I mean?
Where are they all from?
Where they all live?
Upper Crust, Northeast.
Like New York area?
Something like that.
Yeah, that jet region, that region.
All of them?
That re...
I don't know.
Actually, I don't really know to be complete.
I think...
I believe they're all from the Northeast.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's fucking weird.
That sucks.
That's why the rise of this independent shit is going through.
Listen, I have an idea.
Like I was gonna actually talk to you about it at some point.
Like I called up the director slash producer.
I called him up and talked to him.
I said, listen, here's what happened.
I go through the whole thing.
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
Immediately he went to...
The problem with that is that we would be pitching that documentary
to people that have longstanding relationships
with that production company.
And as a result, he immediately started...
I'm like, yeah, but it's an amazing story.
He's like...
And it is...
I'm like, in the B-roll you can use.
And the people that are involved in this.
And I can get everybody lined up.
And he's like, I understand that.
The problem is getting the money to do this.
And then you ask him to place it on a platform
that they buy from that production company.
And then they will have issues with it.
It's political.
Like it becomes super political.
And I'm like, it's all true.
It's irrelevant that it's true.
I'm like, yeah, but this is what happened.
And he's like, that doesn't matter.
Like it doesn't matter that it's an amazing story.
And it's all 100% true.
It could damage their relationship with this company.
And this company was like, fuck.
Yeah.
It's just this giant fucking bureaucracy.
It is, man.
It's like the fucking government.
So I mean, I immediately started thinking,
well, who do I know?
I basically need to get somebody that would go against the grain.
The first person was, I was like,
Danny's as disgusted as I am.
Well, he was disgusted years earlier.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
Danny will film it for you.
We're in a group chat with a group of friends.
And I was really, he said something really funny there.
They were talking about Kyrie Irving.
You know how like Kyrie Irving is like,
he didn't want to get vaccinated.
So like, you know, obviously there's fucking
two opposing views of Kyrie.
Everyone says, oh, freedom, the crazy fucking people.
Like, I love, Tucker loves Kyrie Irving.
And, you know, all the super woke people who love vaccines.
I think Kyrie's in the fucking idiot.
And we're just in a group chat with somebody and she's like,
they're big LeBron fans.
And Kyrie and LeBron, they're obviously like going at it.
They're not like super close anymore.
Kyrie talks shit about LeBron.
They're both on opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to that shit.
Yeah.
Kyrie and LeBron is just like left and right kind of.
And one of the people in the group chat was like,
the only reason I would like Kyrie is if he went back and played with LeBron
and he shut up and didn't say a word, never opened his mouth.
And Shane responded.
He goes, so he should shut up and dribble.
There was a big, a big stink.
Silence after that.
Dude, it was fucking great.
I didn't do it justice, but if you were watching the group chat.
You had to be there.
One of those, you had to be there.
It was great.
But where was I going with that?
I don't remember.
Kyrie Irving.
What were we talking about before that?
Filming a movie or whatever.
Yeah, and vaccination.
Something with vaccination.
Yeah.
Anyways, we'll make your documentary, Matt.
Film it concrete style.
Hell yeah.
What about our other idea that we had?
Bro, do you have any idea how much time that would require of me?
Honestly, I'm struggling just to pay my bills at this point.
I need some time to figure this out.
We got to do it, man.
Can't we just boost somebody's content?
Can't we just take somebody's content and redo it?
Plus, you know how much research it takes?
Yeah.
Or get me the, that guy, listen.
I don't even know how much that guy really,
I think he may just be ad-limbing some of this stuff.
You're talking about, we have to get footage of the people.
You got to go get the footage of them.
Then you have to kind of go through it piece by piece and break it apart.
You're not a psychiatrist.
I don't really know.
That guy's channel is fucking amazing.
I already forget the name of it.
I've watched it.
What's the guy's name again?
Didn't stick with you.
I forgot the name of his channel.
It's the guy that he, what's he do?
He breaks down like these criminal interviews.
So like they'll show like the fucking, for example.
Is he like a psychologist?
For example, the guy who shot the movie.
I don't think he, initially I, he sounds super confident, right?
Like you really think he's, first he tells you a little bit about,
I'm sorry, sorry.
No, go ahead, go ahead.
He, first he tells you a little bit about the case.
Like, you know, like 15 students were shot, blah, blah, blah.
Then they caught him, or then they caught the kid and then they get him into the room.
And at this point, you can tell he's acting normal.
He knows he's concerned.
You can see the concern when he does this, when he does,
he kind of just talks about what he's doing.
Then he says, however, once the detective walks in the room,
notice how he immediately, you know, appears to be, you know,
riddled with anxiety and stress, how he suddenly starts talking to, you know,
he's basically saying how he's faking it.
Right.
And then he ends up being crazy or whatever.
And then when he leaves, so he, he kind of,
and he keeps stopping the video and explaining and then letting the video go
and then stopping it, letting it go.
We got to figure out the name of this guy, Austin.
So it ends up being like an hour to two hour long thing
where he really breaks down the whole thing.
But I watched one the other day that Danny sent me.
And the more I thought about it, I thought, you know,
he's not using any technical terms.
He's just really saying what he thinks is happening.
So I'm like, I was like, how much real research do I have to do?
Right, right.
I mean, what I really just need is the video tape.
Like, where's the video tape and, and why is this person being interviewed?
So one of his most popular videos is a guy who had just got done murdering
like his whole family.
And he's sitting in the interrogation room with the fucking guy.
He's handcuffed to the fucking table and the guy's interrogating him.
And he's like, he's like, he's like fucking like going like this,
like making these weird hand movements and acting like he's insane.
And the moment the fucking cop walks out of the room, this is it.
JCS, criminal psychology.
What was, what is JCS stand for again?
I forget.
It's like Jimmy something.
Oh, it's the, what's, what's her name?
The one that stabbed her.
So yeah, go to, go to videos.
Go to videos, find like his, his top video.
That one right there.
Like that one.
Jody Ayres.
61 million views.
All of his videos are like this.
In the last six, in seven or eight months.
Watch this.
Look at him.
Cruz was a left-handed shooter.
The surveillance at the school would confirm this.
And if you pay close attention to the movements of his hands in the next moments,
although very subtle, you can see that he's reimagining holding his weapon.
But what's more telling is how his demeanor abruptly stops and then completely switches
right before he looks in the direction of the camera.
He goes from holding a rifle and beginning to smirk to then pretending to cry
and reverting back to his suicidal mannerisms.
This all occurs at under four seconds.
It could be assumed that for a brief moment, he was not only recollecting the attack,
but gaining gratification from himself.
Like how do you know any of that?
Right.
He's just giving his observation.
A lot of assumptions.
Right.
Living the attack and enjoying his work while his false self was so dejected
that before he was extradited.
Sounds good.
He's just giving his observation.
A lot of assumptions.
Right.
Living the attack and enjoying his work while his false self was so dejected
that before he was externalizing suicidal thoughts.
Complete opposites.
F**k.
F**k.
His next calculated charade is one of self-harm.
He first bites himself without drawing blood,
or leaving any marks that were visible in his jail intake photographs.
F**k.
What the f**k?
They pretending to chew his wrist off.
He then scratches and squeezes at the two needle punctures in his arm
from where his blood was taken at the hospital.
At the very moment the detective re-enters the room,
he will act as if he's desperately trying to conceal his self-injurious behavior.
Setting aside the glaring contradiction that he just murdered and maimed dozens of people
while leaving himself without so much as a scratch,
it's the frequency of these little charades that makes the deception so transparent.
This is a person who is not self-injurious, pretending to be someone that is,
but it's such a feeble attempt at fainting self-harm.
Okay.
Anyways, that's good though.
Yeah.
So he breaks down the psychology of all these f**king crazy people that, like,
commit heinous crimes and murders,
and they have f**king insane views,
and they just got, like, I don't know what happened.
His channel's still up, but he got, like,
a vast majority of his content got taken down by YouTube for...
Casey Anthony's videos got 25 million views.
Yeah, bro, it's insane.
But they took it down saying it was too violent,
but there's no f**king violence.
They're just showing the people in the interviews.
And people are losing their s**t about it,
because obviously a lot of people love this guy's channel.
Yeah, I think the problem is, is where do you find the videos?
Yeah, yeah.
That's the hardest part.
Right, and, you know, I'm not a psychiatrist,
but I get the, if there are con men and...
If it's like white collar crime, that would be perfect for someone like you.
But where do you get those videos?
That's the question, that's the thing, yeah,
it's not gonna be easy, but...
I mean, I understand, but I mean, at this point in my financial, you know,
well, we can't afford it.
Man, it's always crying about being broke.
Yeah, I am, I am.
Meanwhile, he's making $700 a month on Patreon.
Congratulations, by the way, that's great.
Cha-ching.
That's f**king amazing, man.
It's just under 700.
Listen, bro, I'm, I'm...
I'm proud of you.
I've got, I've got my, my different tears.
When I had, when I had Brett Johnson in here,
I'm giving away paintings.
When I had Brett Johnson in here, he was telling me,
so this Matt Cox guy, as soon as we finished recording,
he goes, so this Matt Cox guy, I've had dozens of people telling me
that I gotta get Matt Cox in a room and we gotta record together.
I told him, I was telling me.
I told him already.
You did?
When I seen him on Lex Friedman, and I was like,
oh my God, this guy's coming out of the woodwork doing interviews again.
F**king, and I was like, dude, Matt, we gotta get him on the podcast.
Yeah.
And then you...
I sent him a...
You have his contact info.
Yeah, I do.
He was just here the other day.
Yeah.
Cool.
We gotta set it up.
Yeah, that'd be weird f**king getting him on the f**king podcast.
Have you met him before?
No.
No, I haven't.
What about the counterfeiter?
Oh dude, his video's blowing up.
Right?
Yeah.
Jeff.
His video's blowing up.
I love the comments.
I think it's because of the comments.
I think the only reason that video's one of the main reasons it's doing good
is how f**king dumb I was on the podcast.
I came in after a full day of drinking.
It was on a Sunday.
What?
You totally didn't even...
I didn't...
It was a last minute.
First of all, I was f**king hammered drunk because I was drinking the whole entire day.
Matt Cox calls me at like, what time did you call me?
Oh, it was probably two or three o'clock and I was like, what are you doing?
Yeah.
You wanna have this guy on your podcast?
You don't meet a lot of counterfeiters.
Like you just...
Even in federal prison, I probably met three or four the whole time.
Like...
And he knew...
And it's funny because you know when he starts talking, you know what he knows.
You immediately know what he knows.
I don't know what else he's talking about, but when he starts talking about counterfeiting,
you're like, oh, this motherfucker counterfeited some money.
Oh, yeah.
Like you know he knows.
Oh, yeah.
Like I don't...
Half the stuff may be insane what he's talking...
What Bozak's talking about, but the moment he starts talking about credit cards and making credit cards,
you're like, oh, yeah, you're not...
No, okay.
I don't know about all that either.
Go on.
Stop the moon landing thing, but you can make a card.
So, yeah, I was no preparation.
It was like two hours notice for the podcast and I was drunk and I just walked in and I
was fucking moron on the podcast.
I asked a guy the same question twice within like...
Oh, and people, I'm sure people went nuts.
Oh, if you just read the top comments, it's just fucking shits down my throat.
This guy is carrying the podcast on his back.
He explains things well and speaks objectively.
The viewer is a straight up fool.
300 likes on that comment.
Oh, God, dude.
Wow.
Dude, you get crucified in the comment section though.
Listen, you sent a fucking comment to Matt the other day that somebody had fucking a long-winded one.
Did I?
Oh my God, dude, it was the greatest thing ever.
It said something a lot.
The one line that I just...
Six out to me, most that I remember from it said that,
why are you giving this guy a platform?
Because he's...
What'd he say?
Oh, oh, it's shitting on Matt.
God damn it, dude.
I forgot what they said.
Something about he...
I love sending...
I love sending Matt the comments that just fucking roast him,
because they're mostly roasting me.
He reads 400 comments.
He finds one that says something negative.
He's like, that's the one I'm sending to him.
What about the other 399, Danny?
Well, those are common.
That was a great one, though.
The last one you sent him was fucking phenomenal.
What did it say about Matt?
Oh, dude, they were pissed.
They were upset that Danny was giving Matt a platform.
This snitch piece of garbage, little life scumbag.
Why would you give someone like this a platform?
He doesn't deserve to live.
What about his victims or something?
Blah, blah, blah.
He's just like...
He said this guy's willing to take advantage of anyone.
He deems less important than himself.
That's right.
To pad his fucking criminal bank account.
And I'm like, yeah, you said it to me.
Damn!
And the whole time I was reading it going...
Dude, they were pissed.
They were pissed.
I mean, I don't like his characterization.
They were so mad, dude.
The delivery sucked, but it was pretty accurate.
I think it was quite eloquent how they wrote it.
Yeah, it was great.
It was well put together.
I was like, dang!
It was beautifully articulated.
It was beautifully articulated.
I think he could have been nicer.
That's fine.
Anyways, we just did three hours.
Awesome.
So I think let's wrap her up.
Cut it.
John, plug your shit.
Yeah, man.
Just come to my Instagram account at slumbineager on Instagram.
And if you want to buy any paintings from me, you can do so there also.
Tune in to my Instagram account and go ahead and hit the subscribe button.
That's boziat conundrum podcast on YouTube.
I'm doing a lot of good things over there now.
And shit's just only going to get crazier.
So yeah, subscribe, subscribe, subscribe.
My channel's growing like a motherfucker right now.
My views are going crazy.
Subscribers, like I said, I'm getting by the fistful every day.
Hell yeah.
Let us know in the comments if you guys are down to see Matt or John do some tattoos live.
Yeah.
And I'm still down for the ass cheek tattoos too if we can hit that 10k.
We can hit that 10,000 mark.
I think that would be great.
You want to read Matt's comment?
Just the title of it is great.
This is great.
I'm giving the mega douche Matthew Cox a platform five stars.
I love concrete podcast.
I love Danny.
He chooses fascinating subjects and speakers.
He leads fascinating conversations.
But for the love of God and all that is holy, please stop giving mega douche Cox a platform.
I don't care how extroverted, animated and able to carry a story the guy is.
He's a jailhouse snitch and a self serving human being that literally took advantage of people.
He deemed less important than himself in order to steal their identities, pad his and pad his illegal bank accounts and evade the FBI.
Then he has the sack to talk about it openly to anybody listening.
The guy is a sociopath and doesn't deserve a do over or a public platform to pedal his tales of illegally gotten clout shamelessly.
He deserves nothing less than to be a de-platformed and shunned into obscurity for the rest of his miserable jailhouse snitch existence.
That is all.
Clip, clip that.
I am clipping that and putting that all over social media.
That was awesome.
Well done.
If you are watching this right now, well done.
I mean hurtful.
Tell us what the guy's username is on YouTube.
If that's you, please comment. We'll send you some free merch.
Yeah, we'll send you.
This guy, please leave a comment on this podcast with your email address and we'll get in touch and we're going to send you a shitload of free stuff.
What is his name? His last review, right?
Latest reviews.
No, he doesn't have his name on there.
Oh, oh, this was on a YouTube comment.
Oh, 24 days ago by...
This was a comment on Apple Podcasts.
Oh, sounds like Russian.
It was a review on Apple Podcasts. It wasn't on YouTube.
The snitch really hit the bone.
That was like the core of the message. You were a snitch and he found a really articulated way to just shit on you.
Oh, I mean, you know...
Mega douche, Matthew Cox.
Mega douche, Matthew Cox.
He said that he's got the sack to talk about and anybody that's willing to listen.
Here, this is another one.
These are what Danny sends me.
Cry me, I love it. Been listening for nearly six months.
I've never seen a photo of Matt, but I always pictured him as a bald guy.
Now I get it, he's just little.
God damn.
I mean...
They're fucking brutal. They're absolutely brutal.
These are good, man.
We should save all those and make a little book out of them or something in one day.
Oh, we should make a table...
Yeah, ten years of comments. They're just fucking classics.
All the best ones.
That would be beautiful.
And we could sell them.
Listen, you could go through all of...
All of soft white underbelly,
VladTV, you could go through value tape.
I mean, because they all have them.
Yeah.
Oh, God, what's his name? What was the guy?
The Big Herk?
Big Herk.
You go through all those channels.
There are some people that are not happy with me.
Oh, yeah.
I like to say that they just don't really know me.
Probably.
I just got to get to know him. He's a great guy.
Just like the Joker.
I wonder why they got pictures of you as bald.
He's so serious.
He said, I never saw a picture of Matt,
but I always thought he was bald.
The last part when I read it,
I just fucking died laughing.
And the worst thing, I was laughing that I thought...
Jailhouse snitch existence.
Oh, God.
Yeah, the snitch really hits a bone with something.
They really get upset about that.
Yeah.
Oh, but Belford just did Vlad
and he talks about it.
Asked him about...
About you?
No, about cooperating. Belford.
He says basically the same thing you said?
Well, what's funny is he explains that he says,
look, he said, did I cooperate?
He goes, yeah, I cooperate.
He's like, I wore a wire.
And he said, I wore a wire on a couple people.
He said, nobody said anything that really
really incriminated themselves.
He said, and I knew everybody was going to cooperate
and I was going to have to testify anyway.
So I wasn't concerned.
He said, be honest with you. He said, you're looking at 20, 30 years.
He said, everybody on Wall Street cooperates.
He said, then he said they had me go
with my best friend.
Which was a guy named, I think his name was Danny.
And he goes to Danny and he said,
you know, and I was like,
Danny definitely had done some things.
Like I knew it was going to be bad.
He said, so I slipped him a note
that said, I'm wired.
Don't say anything to incriminate yourself.
And he goes, and he took the note
and he said, okay.
So we had a conversation and he didn't say anything.
He said, three months later,
they had indicted Danny
for other reasons, nothing I had done.
He said, and the agent comes
and bangs on my front door
and he said, and holds up the note.
Damn, I kept the note.
Yeah, and he said, yeah, he said,
and what Danny did as soon as they indicted him
was he cooperated against me.
He said, right then, I lost my,
he was my faith in humanity.
He said, and I enthusiastically
cooperated against everyone since then.
And he, you know, he was like, yeah.
And that was it.
How did they get the note?
Because when he gave it to Danny,
Danny kept it.
And so three months later when they came
and they arrested him anyway,
he was like, listen, Belford this,
Belford that, boom, he always kept the note.
I mean, yeah.
He said, yeah, he said, and then he went on
and said, and to be honest, he said,
I got lucky that the agent liked me
and didn't push for them to give me a bunch of time.
He ended up getting, I think, 18 months
or four years and he ended up doing 18 months
is what it was. But he explains the whole thing.
He breaks it down.
And so anyway, that's on,
Colby sent me that and said,
bro, you've got to do a video on this,
on Belford, you know.
So, I thought.
You need a reaction video. I can't wait to see it.
Yeah. I thought it was funny.
Cool. Matthew, where can we subscribe
to your Patreon and buy your paintings
and your books?
I mean, Patreon, you know.
Patreon.patreon.com.
Is it? Maybe it's just Matt Cox.
I don't know. I'll send you the link.
There's different tiers and I have a YouTube channel
and it's called Matt Cox Inside True Crime
and yeah.
And I sell paintings.
Perfect. And Boziak's got a bunch of paintings.
Yeah. Please buy my paintings.
Nipsey. DM Boziak
about the Nipsey Hustle painting
and the Daffy Duck doing cocaine.
Hell yeah.
Good night, everybody.
