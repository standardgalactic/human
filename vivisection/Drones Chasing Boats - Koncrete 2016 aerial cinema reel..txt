Never you mind if I don't tell strangers passing by
About my love for you
Never you mind if I don't tell strangers passing by
Never you mind if I don't tell strangers passing by
Don't tell strangers passing by
About my love for you
Oh, we can run somewhere that's true
Oh, we can run somewhere that's true
