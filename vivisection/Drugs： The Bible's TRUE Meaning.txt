The Romans have come through a world that was the Bronze Age renaissance of drugs,
Dotes and antidotes they call it, Christ and Antichrist.
They are pharmacological terms and they're using them that way and when you get baptized
this is what you're being baptized into. It's the only way to bring eternal life and you say,
wait a minute why don't I thought because you're thinking the wrong eternal life there's no phrase
in the New Testament it says eternal life. They all say Ionic life. Ionic life.
Which what does that mean? It's outside the time stream.
