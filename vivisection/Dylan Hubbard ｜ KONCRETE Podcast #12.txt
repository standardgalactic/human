what's going on man how you doing good good another damn paradise that's cool man thanks
for coming on this no worries you uh so you and your family have a long history in panellas
county and especially in the fishing community give us a little background on that real quick
yeah hubbard's marina is our family business we've been fishing local waters for over 90 years and
four generations uh my grandfather started our company in uh with seven rowboats and 14 cane
poles and uh over 90 years later we're uh doing anything from two inches of water out past a
thousand foot we have uh 12 different vessels operating in our fleet uh six of those being
federally permitted offshore fishing vessels uh four of those six are private charter vessels and
then two are party boat trips uh or party boat vessels and uh we've been very uh blessed to be
able to grow as a family business and sustain um success by just doing our best to stay ahead of
the curve and uh really trying to give back to the community while also trying to stay active
in the fisheries management arena uh because nowadays it's becoming more and more important to be
active and up to date with what's going on and the federal fisheries management level
as fisheries become more and more accountable uh it's very important to try to stay out of the
curve and know what's coming uh as is evident in the commercial fishery so you guys you guys started
in john's pass right which is one of the main main ports in panellas county or no or we started from
what was then called hubbard's pier and uh it was eighth avenue in pasacryl and uh back in those
days uh john's pass wasn't really a thing too much because most people lived in golf port
and then they would take a ferry over to pasacryl uh so pasacryl and terraverde as well so
pasacryl was kind of the hub and everybody went to pasacryl so that's where we actually started
and when my grandfather first started it was just him but over time he had uh six or seven
charter boat vessels operating out of there behind world war one is when we got our first
motor driven charter boat and that that world war one really enabled a lot of the charter fleet
and fishing fleet in our area to become motor powered because it made the combustion engine
so much widely uh accessible and affordable and that's kind of when things blew up in our area
and fishing really became what people traveled to our area for and uh in the early 60s is when we
started running our party boats uh in 1967 we were actually the first uh on the entire west
coast of florida to offer overnight long range party boat fishing trips we were the first uh
operate a private charter vessel uh here in the central west florida area uh we invented the
half day fishing trip uh back in the early 60s and um over time it's just again just blessed to
stay out of the curve nowadays we operate the first uh and one-of-a-kind hydrofoil assisted
us coast guard inspected uh catamaran so it's actually a go fast charter boat that rides on
a wing above the water uh it's pretty unique we just got that a few years ago it's been about
two and a half years we've been operating that vessel uh we had it built custom uh out of louisiana
area and uh we got the plans from someone in south africa the scientists had uh devised it
and a lot of people use that same technology on six pack boats or what's called an uninspected vessel
because when you carry six passengers or less you don't have to be coast guard inspected
whereas if you carry that seventh or more passengers you have to be coast guard inspected
which basically means you have to draw plans of the naval engineer you have to send it off to uh
ms o in washington dc which is like the head of the coast guard yeah takes them a few months
to sign off on the plans picture that thing yeah and what's it called the flying hub two you can
find it on our website flying hub two yeah website that's insane and uh basically i've never heard
of this oh it's a wild boat it's beautiful it sounds super expensive it was very how much is it can
tell us uh it was uh just shy of a million dollars what yeah if you close that and then go to private
charters okay and then flying hub two you'll see the photos ever got a little uh photo gallery as it
loads 40 by 14 yeah it's a very fast boat and uh it can actually take uh up to 20 passengers uh out
fishing at about 33 knots which equates to about 40 miles an hour so it's just a wild boat and when
it gets back this uh slideshow when it gets back to the front you'll see the boat cruising at speed
and it actually comes up on the wing so it rides above the water here's how a boat normally rides
which the waterline you can see uh is just at a normal distance from the water and it's just cruising
in the water right but when it gets up to a certain speed those hydrofoils actually lift the boat so
right there that's not the boat hitting a wave that's the boat right it's right like that and what's
the benefit of it being like as a faster smoother yeah there's less hydrodynamic drag so only the
back quarter the boat is actually touching the surface of the water okay so without all that
water dragging on the hull you have a lot more efficiency the boat's a lot more quiet and you
have a lot more speed and you can carry more weight more efficiently uh normally a boat like that uh
with 20 passengers on it you wouldn't be able to go 40 miles an hour okay and that boat only has 350
horsepower engines it's got two of them so it's only right yeah yeah so it's actually got two
mercuries on it now yeah but with 700 horsepower to push 20 people at 40 miles an hour it's pretty
i mean no one does that so people just go on that for for what i mean do you fish on that boat
or yeah yeah we do a lot of uh offshore fishing on it we do uh private charters on it it's mainly
a private charter fishing vessel right um but we do have a public split charter style trip on
Wednesday and Sundays we do a 12-hour stream where you're fishing 70 to 100 miles from shore
you get about seven to eight hours fishing time and you get a serious chance for some really big
fish and it's only 300 bucks so to get 70 to 100 miles out and fish that long it's it's a pretty
unique option that's awesome so do you actually run these boats yourself yeah yeah i operate all the
vessels in our fleet uh i'm the vice president and uh co-owner of Hubbard's marina and i'm uh
really involved in the day-to-day operations so unfortunately i don't get to uh go out and
play on the water as much as i would like but running the boat to me is a a lot like i have
in a day off work because it's a lot of fun but unfortunately a lot of times i'm stuck in the office
especially this time of year when we have a lot of admin stuff to do for the following year but
when we get busy and we need a captain uh or when something unique's going on uh i typically uh
am called up for it so i run a lot of our shark fishing trips and then uh i run a lot of private
charters where clients request me wow that's awesome what kind of people what's the majority of the
customers that come to you guys are they fishing people or are the people just looking to go on a
party boat or it really depends on the trip i mean we run anything from sunset cruises to
dolphin watches to island trips to snorkeling to shelling to fishing in our fishing trips we do a
five uh 10 12 39 44 and 63 hour trip so it really depends on the trip uh and also the client
because we also have private charters that we could do anywhere from three to 72 hours so like on a
63 hour trip we'll have people flying in from california new york uh chicago all yeah even we
had a guy the other day that traveled from the uk to do our 39 hour trip so on those longer trips
it's more advanced anglers who are looking to go catch some big fish or have the opportunity uh to
go catch some big fish whereas on our five hour trip there's a lot more families and just people to
look and to go out for the day and stuff yeah what a line right so it's it's very interesting to me
to see the evolution of the angler you have the guy that just wants to learn how to catch a fish
and he's ecstatic to just hook one right and then you have anything yeah and then you have the guy
that's learned how to do it and really thinks he's got it figured out but he's still struggling
a little bit and he's happy if he catches a few then you got the guy who he's he's got it all
down pat you can't teach him nothing and all he wants to do is kill him all to get him off yeah
and then you got the guy that's done that for a long time and is realizing that hey we gotta put
some of these back and he's more catch and release oriented it's just out there to have a good time
and enjoy the water and then you get to a certain point where fishing is fishing yourself is kind of
overrated i would rather sit out there and show you how to catch a fish and watch you catch a fish
and i really enjoy getting kids hooked on fishing and people who don't know how to fish
trying to get them hooked on fishing and become more effective offshore because
it can get frustrating i mean especially offshore fishing if you got your own boat you spent
20 30 40 even a hundred thousand dollars on this boat you got to put 200 300 gallons of fuel in it
so i mean you're you have to invest a thousand dollars a lot of times to get offshore and go
fishing yeah and if you spend a thousand dollars and you go out there and you don't catch any fish
and you had a terrible time you can't anchor on your spot you're not going to want to keep doing it
right yeah so that's what i really enjoy is kind of teaching people how to be more effective and
that's really what we kind of put an emphasis on is just um furthering our industry conserving
our fishery and uh teaching people how to get hooked on fishing when you say conserving the
your fishery what do you mean by fishery like i guess what is a fishery our fishery in the
gulf of mexico is what that means is uh just the whole industry as a whole our fishery supports
not only our waterfront coastal economies and working waterfronts but it also supports a lot
of families and a lot of businesses and a lot of people's access to the gulf of mexico and the fish
we catch the fishery is kind of an overarching umbrella term to refer to any type of fishing
activities or fishing related business businesses because a recreational angler like yourself someone
who's not commercial fishing someone who doesn't own a party boat you have a few different ways to
access the fishery you can go stand on a seawall go down to a fishing pier you could go buy your own
boat or go with a buddy or you can have an opportunity to go on a party boat or a charter boat
and uh it really doesn't matter how you access the fishery you're a recreational angler uh that
looks for an opportunity to wet a line and each sector of our fishery we have commercial fishermen
and then we have recreational fishermen and when it comes to red snapper we also have four
higher recreational which is charter boats and party boats so to me it doesn't matter how you
access the fishery you're still a recreational angler and it's very interesting the differences in
how we prosecute our fisheries when you're talking about a commercial guy a four-higher
wreck guy or a private wreck guy um because a private wreck guy he's going out there for an
opportunity to fill that cooler he doesn't necessarily have to fill that cooler his is his
his benefit or the intrinsic value that he places on that uh fishing trip isn't based on how full
his cooler is uh whereas a commercial guy he's out there to fill the cooler that's what he does
and the only way he gets paid is if he does fill that cooler right so they totally view their trip
a totally different way and we all uh prosecute our fisheries in different ways from the depth
fish the area fish the length of the trip and uh then you have the party boat and charter boat
guys which we're giving those private wreck guys a chance to access the fishery by providing the
mode of transportation but it's still the same idea we're giving them that opportunity to fill
the cooler so the commercial guys need to be able to land a certain amount of fish and they need to
be able to have that flexibility to do so whereas the recreational guys we just need access we need
days at sea and it doesn't necessarily mean if you if I give you if you have 200 pounds of fish
to catch a commercial guy is going to go out there and catch it in one day he's going to stay out
or one trip he's going to stay out there for a week if it takes him and he's going to catch those
fish whereas a recreational guy he might go fishing 10 15 20 times before he gets that 200 pounds
because he's got to make it home for dinner or he's got to work tomorrow whatever yeah they don't
stay out for weeks at a time like the commercial fishery so it's very interesting when uh the
federal fisheries management and a lot of people approach our fishery and try to manage it as a
whole when you really have to evaluate the modes and evaluate the way in which we prosecute our
fishery and the way we go about it because it's all so different so to me conserving the fishery
just means providing access to recreational anglers giving the commercial anglers an opportunity to
prosecute the fishery in which will most benefit their businesses and allow the seafood industry
to continue here in the nation because we have a huge seafood industry do you guys do anything with
seafood we do not we're strictly recreational and that's a little bit frustrating for me sometimes
is a lot of people look at us and say oh you're a commercial fisherman well we're not the commercial
fishermen have these boats they do extended trips and they sell their fish yeah a recreational
angler cannot sell their fish any fish caught on our boats doesn't matter how when what they
cannot be sold in any way legally so we're not out there to sell catch fish and sell fish and
make money on fish we make money on the opportunity to catch that fish so a guy comes out fishing with
us or a girl comes out fishing with us for a chance to catch that fish and that's the way we
make a living so we're not commercial fishermen we're recreational fishermen but we do it for
hire so that's why there's for higher recreational private recreational and commercial and those are
the three sectors in our fishery currently there's a scene like there's much competition i mean
i don't know of anyone else doing what you guys are doing on the scale that you guys are doing it
around this area there's 1237 federally permitted charter boat and party boat vessels in the Gulf of
Mexico right now and uh when you say charter boat i mean you mean strictly bringing people out
to go fish and just catch fish not for the purpose of selling it just charter boats and
party boats yes they're for hire recreational they do not sell their fish and uh did you say in the
whole state in the Gulf of Mexico in the Gulf of Mexico okay but florida has 40 percent i i don't
recall the exact breakdown but it's around 40 percent of those 1237 and in our area alone we
have about seven to eight party boat vessels that fish out of penales county so there's some pretty
decent competition now as far as the scale of our business a lot of other people have two party
boats and a few charter boats uh there's two operations in clear water that have the same kind
of setup oh yeah and there's another place up in uh Panama city beach florida uh that had the exact
same operation we do multiple charter boats multiple party boats and dolphin watching
shelling snorkeling all that so uh there's other people doing what we do but we try to set ourselves
apart by uh that customer service and that uh a willingness to educate uh if you go up to fishing
trips on our website here yeah uh when you scroll down to the bottom there from fishing tips and
tricks to our fishing seminars to our live stream shows to the weather links to the fishing rules
to the fishing reports wow all that information is for people whether they're fishing with us
they're fishing on their own boat or they're fishing on someone else's boat and that's how
we try to set ourselves apart it's being that uh source for people to try to learn more about
fishing get hooked on fishing and then also we guarantee an excellent client experience with
superior guest service and we really try to go above and beyond and I try to personally take
that uh to heart and really try to be there for a guest when they leave be there for a guest when
they come back yeah we do confirmation emails reminder emails thank you emails we do a pre boarding
seminar we do a fishing seminar on the way out our crew and captains a lot of these guys we have
one captain that's been there 25 years we have uh two crew members that have been working together
as a team for 15 years we've got one guy that's been there 14 years and we try to foster that
family oriented family friendly uh environment and it really seems to carry out to our captains
and crew we've been really blessed to have just an outstanding team and we've been able to keep
them around and that's how we set ourselves apart because uh in my biased opinion shout out to Shane
Lee yeah in my he doesn't he doesn't work for you just to clear it up no he's uh he's a he's a friend
and he lives in the area but no it uh the commercial fishery that that goes back to what I was saying
earlier it's just so different because a guy like Shane Lee can catch fish and kill a ton of fish
and he's probably amazing at being out there and and catching fish right can that same individual
go teach how to fish can that same individual offer that excellent client experience a few things
I don't know if fishing is yeah yeah and that's that's the thing is that that professional appearance
that client experience and client service and then the ability to not only catch fish yourself
but teach out of fish right and uh that kind of separates the commercial fleet from the
recreational or fire for hire recreational because on a commercial boat there's no client on board
there's no there's no uh guest service and uh it's a very different industry what is your
perspective on I mean I'm I know you've seen deckhands the series that we did what is your
perspective on on all those guys and that whole community as a whole as far as the commercial
guys who go out for seven to ten days on a boat yeah and just recklessly you know do whatever
they do get fucked up and then come back and you know what is your perspective on that that whole
that whole thing well I mean I grew up in Madeira Beach I've lived on Madeira Beach my whole life
and I know a lot of these guys and some of the commercial fleet is uh some very good role models
and guys like Bobby Spave Martin Fisher uh Jason Delacruz the the the shareholders the people that
have the allocation uh that are business oriented professional and uh they they've done things right
they stayed out of the curve and uh the captain's captain John Hood there's there's a ton of commercial
captains that are completely clean cut respectable hardworking individuals not that Shane Lee and
Spacely aren't uh hardworking individuals but uh the clean cut stuff maybe not so much but it's uh
in my view on the whole thing is uh it's it it really depends on what you're doing and how you
approach it I mean there's a lot of boats in Madeira Beach that have zero tolerance for drugs
and alcohol then there's other boats in Madeira Beach where they each deck hand brings a a little
baggy of drugs in a case of beer and you kill it on the way out and then it's seahab the rest of the
trip you're withdrawing and going through rehab basically and you're totally dry and there's other
boats that they set out there and do heroin the whole time you know and uh everybody has their own
approach to things and I think the guys who are doing it right uh I mean you can tell just standing
on the end of my dock in John's past I can see a boat and I can tell that the captain cares and he
gives a shit and the owner cares because you'll have a commercial boat that's beautiful painted just
perfect nice clean they take a dry dock every year and they they scrub it and uh there's no rust on
it and then you have a commercial boat go by that's looks like it doesn't belong on the water and
shouldn't float and yeah it's just covered in rust and dingy and it looks like it hasn't been scrubbed
in a year so uh my view on it is just like anything else you have your good apples you have your bad
apples and uh unfortunately there's a few bad apples in every bunch and uh it's really changed
and since the I'm only 27 years old and in my lifetime the commercial fishery has completely
evolved and and changed uh some might say for the worse some might say for the better
but I mean when I was a kid uh Madeira Beach John's Pass was a grouper capital of the world
we had uh we had hundreds 500 plus uh grouper boats fishing out of Madeira Beach and going out there
and catching a ton of fish and coming back nowadays there's 50 so there's been uh regulation
regulation tightening up the industry and in consolidation the IFQ system did exactly what
it was set out to do which was consolidate and make the fishery accountable and the commercial
fleet it is ridiculous the amount of red tape they have to do a commercial boat what is red
tape when you say yeah red tape because I don't know this fish in terms yeah I don't know what that
means just bureaucracy I mean a commercial fishing boat has to have a vessel monitoring system what's
called a VMS for short uh so when that boat moves it's gotta hail out so if you're taking your boat
to go fuel up you gotta call in and say hey I'm going to the fuel dock if you're going fishing
you gotta say hey I'm going fishing I'm gonna target this species this species and this species
and I plan to land this IFQ species then when you come back in you have to hail in and give a
three hour notice so if you or if your phone's not working or whatever you cannot take that boat
to the dock or you have you have a fishery violation you have to call in and give three
hours notice so there's a lot of times there'll be a commercial boat sitting at the bell buoy
or sitting offshore waiting because they made a little bit better speed than they thought etc
and they cannot hit that dock until that three hours is up and they have to be at an approved
landing site so you have to call in and get your landing site or your dock that you uh depart and
embark from approved so you have to tell the federal government when you're leaving when you're
coming back and you have to give them three hours notice that when you're coming back so they can
come and inspect and you have to go to an approved site that's accessible for the federal government
to be able to come inspect and approve your catch then every single fish that comes off that boat
is counted weighed and then 98% of the time there's an FWC or NOAA officer there doing data collection
the FW or the commercial fisheries the gold standard of data collection when you approach
fishery dependent data because every fish is weighed measured and accounted for
and they have a vessel monitoring system so their effort is 100% tracked that boat anywhere it goes at
any time the NOAA's OLE or office of law enforcement is able to pull up that vessel and see its heading
its direction its speed and whether or not it's stopped or moving and they can evaluate when they
fish where they fish and then they know exactly what they caught and then the fisheries research
that comes out of that we have a commercial boat that lands at our dock and they do ODE lists on
each one of the fish they take stomach samples they take a ton of information so did this start
like with the IFQ's or was it like this before that the VMS started a little bit before the IFQ
but it was a setup to make the IFQ system possible and as far as the checks and balances weighing
each fish and all that had a lot to do with the IFQ system and they have trip tickets literally
john's pass jason delacruz and the shareholders alliance in the Gulf of Mexico and a few other
key players in the commercial industry created this thing called golf wild and it's basically a QR
code so if you go to a place like salt rock grill or you go to a high-end seafood restaurant around
here on the menu it will tell you the boat and the captain's name of the fish that you're about to
eat and they'll bring you the QR code and you can scan it and you can see the general area it was
caught when it was caught how it was caught the gear used it is insane the ability for a guest
i've never heard of something like that yeah it's crazy because the fish is accounted for every
single one is accounted for as they come off the boat and then when it's taken to the seafood house
and sold it's accounted for again then when it comes to the restaurant it's accounted for again
that trip ticket tracks that fish from the time it left the fish box to the time it made it to the
seafood house to the time it made it to the restaurant and that and then to your plate yeah
that amount of red tape and like ups they got to jump through and a lot of people that aren't
as educated or up to speed on our fishery blame commercial fishering commercial fishermen for
the death of our fishery or short seasons or their inability to access the fishery
when in part the commercial fishing and the commercial fishermen and the commercial fishery
does a lot to provide data and better fisheries management and now the commercial or that same
model is being moved into the for hire recreational fleet as of october 2019 every vessel in the
gulf of mexico that operates a charter boat or party boat will have a vessel monitoring system
and we'll have to hail out and give notice when we're leaving and when we're coming back
and we have to report every fish that is caught and harvested and every fish that is caught and
released so we are hoping that that accountability and that ability for fisheries managers to
evaluate our cat should hopefully increase our access because accountability is everything
right now in the fishery management spectrum they have things like the m-rip survey which is basically
a fancy way of guessing what is landing what is caught and how many fishermen are out there
right now they randomly sample a set of unit or a set of recreational anglers
and then they send out a mailing list or a mailer to coastal households that are signed up for a
fishing license a special fishing license and they take the responses from those surveys
and then the random samples and they extrapolate it over a geographic region so if they talk it to
Sally Sue and Clearwater and John and Pinellas Park and someone else down in the Skyway area
and then they sit at a boat ramp and see that this boat caught xyz this boat caught x and this boat
caught z then they take that information and extrapolate it as a fisheries landing information
and effort data for Pinellas County and that information can be skewed sometimes by people
biasing the data whereas if I'm standing on a ramp and I'm just picking off shoreboats it's
going to look like we have this huge catch fisheries are going to close and it's going to
lead to overfishing and then extremely shortened seasons it's just the the unfortunate part is
it takes a lot of money to manage our fishery and a lot of people and boots on the grounds and it
costs a lot of money to pay someone to do these surveys and the recreational industry as a whole
in Florida is enormous there is a million a million registered boaters and boaters in
Pinellas County and every each one of those in Pinellas County yeah and each one of those boats
will go out there and kill a bunch of fish and come back to a private dock and it doesn't give
anybody a chance to survey that boat the only surveys that are being done are at public areas
like a public boat ramp so how many boats go out and go fill a cooler and come back to a private
dock and never get surveyed or checked and that's the problem the recreational industry is there's
so many of them they don't know how many people are fishing and they don't know what they're catching
wouldn't that happen with commercial too are there any commercial boats they go to docks that
aren't public absolutely not you have to land in a salt rock you have to be an improved landing
site yeah and they have to give three hours notice when they're coming back to that dock
yeah so there's no way for a commercial fisherman to cheat the system because their vessels are
monitored they every action or movement of that vessels monitored they have to tell them when
they're coming back where they're coming back to and it has to be an approved accessible site for a
fisheries management or fisheries enforcement officer to come inspect the catch and now in the
four hire recreational industry the 1237 charter boats and party boats in the gulf are going to
have to do the same thing hail out hail in and record every fish that's caught every fish that's
released so that accountability is now moving into the recreational sector and it's it goes it's
going in line with what they did in the commercial sector if cues or individual fishing quota is what's
called an allocation based management so they take the entire Gulf of Mexico's fish and the quota
that you're allowed to catch and they split it up and award it to different individuals like say
Danny you've been fishing for 10 years you've been catching 5 000 pounds of fish a year they're
going to give you 5 000 pounds of fish and those are your fish that you can land even if he doesn't
go out and catch them no that those and that's how the ifq system started is they looked at
landing history how do they determine what if i caught 10 000 pounds of fish like what is that
based on is that trip tickets trip tickets yeah which is a certain amount of time yeah what you
came in i i'm not 100 sure how much time they use for the ifq sector but they basically took the
commercial quota and split it up based on landings history and awarded it to different individuals
because that's the one thing that was the most confusing to me when we were making deckhands
was trying to explain that and i had a lot of different people explain it to me pretty well
i think the best was Ozzy the guy that runs save on seafood yeah um and that's what it came down to
in the commercial fleet you had these derby seasons because there was only a certain amount of quota
and these guys were running out there and trying to fish hard and catch that quota before it closed
and it was unsafe there was a lot of problems with safety at sea there was a lot of problems with
managing that fishery because we're like facebook or instagram or something when pull up like
their facebook or their instagram or something sorry sorry go ahead no worries it's at the bottom
of the website all the different uh links we got some videos or something yeah there you go bottom
left facebook yeah we got a bunch of videos but yeah i mean like shane like the first like the
first thing that we when we first time we ever met up when interviewed shane he was the one thing
that him and a lot of the other guys were extremely angry about was i have cues and it seemed like
they didn't really understand it either it's kind of just like they felt like people were taking
their money they're getting fucked over because they're the ones that are busting their asses break
in their hands and there's people somewhere sitting on a couch somewhere in new jersey or
montana that is taking a cut of their checks yeah and that's uh ultimately what happened i mean again
you can love it or hate it the ifq system has consolidated the fishery made it more accountable
and has allowed for more safety at sea so it's done some really good things but at the same time
it's put a lot of people out of business because when they did that initial distribution of quota
there was a lot of guys that didn't get enough quota to survive and a lot of the commercial
fishermen took a 60 percent hit 70 percent hit because if you were catching 20 000 pounds of fish
you didn't get 20 000 pounds in the initial distribution you got like 60 of that 40 000
pounds and what happens is you're able to spread that out through the whole year and a lot of people
didn't get enough to survive so intelligent guys that were prepared were able to go out there and
purchase up other quota so say you only got a thousand pounds of fish you can't make a living
on that so you sell your quota to someone else and guys went out and bought up all this allocation
like that guy buddy gwinden in texas with that show that big fish texas he owns all that red snapper
yeah that's what he did he went out and bought a whole bunch of allocation jason delacruz here
in madera beach he mortgaged his house sold everything and went out and bought as much
allocation as he could really yeah these guys right when it happened yeah these guys literally
bet their lives and bet their livelihoods and bet their families on the fact that
they need to try to grab as much as they can so those are the guys that are at home sitting on
the couch and a lot of them don't most of them fish jason fishes every day are almost but he's
out there all the time fishing these are not bad guys but they do own a lot of allocation
and they do have the ability to say well you want to go out and catch the right grouper
i'll lease you some of my quota but they get a cut of that because they get the least price
so for example because this guy's going to sell it anyways that guy should he should get his
his cut if he's gonna lease some of his shares so basically you have an allocation and then you
have shares so based on the total allowable catch or the ultimate quota for the year uh you have
an allocation your allocation is a percentage of the fishery so say you have five let's say
let's make it easy on myself yeah say you have a ten percent i mean to my brains running slow
say you have a ten percent allocation so that's the percentage of the fishery they come out and
they say all right next year the total allowable catches 100 pounds that means for like the whole
gulf of mexico yeah okay so that means you get 10 pounds to catch through the year so your shares
are then those pounds so you can go out and lease the pound of fish okay granted that was a small
example to keep it easy but they can have a lot of pounds to lease out and catch themselves so
some guys will keep all their allocation for their own fish house like jason has a big fish house so
he has a couple boats of his own that go out there and fish and he puts captains and crew together
and they go out there and prosecute the fishery and bring it in he himself has a commercial
fishing boat where he goes out there and goes diving and they they do well for themselves it's
business but it's just like anything else you have a it's like leasing a car hey you can go out
and use this car to drive ure but you're gonna have to pay me for each mile you drive it's the same
idea like red snapper i think i want to say is like 450 a pound is what they can sell it to
a seafood house for and the lease price is like 225 a pound so it's almost 50 percent yeah and that's
the problem right now with red grouper is and that's why shane lee and and space are so upset
it's not the it's not the lease price that's killing them what's killing them is the different
fishery aspects right now right now bobby spade for example he told me he would give me red grouper
quota give it to me because he can't sell it because there's there it's too hard for them to catch
a commercial fisherman has to be able to go out there and catch enough fish on that trip to cover
expenses pay their deckhands pay the fuel bill pay the grocery bill cover the cost in wear and tear
on the boat and then anything extra of that is split between the captain crew and the boat but
when red grouper is selling for two dollars a pound and you have to go out there and lease it for
25 cents 30 cents why would you go catch a fish for two dollars a pound you're going to go after
that red snapper that's where four dollars a pound are you going to go fish another fishery
that you can get more money for at the fish house and here in our area we're mainly known for our
red grouper and gag grouper fishery yeah and that's what our commercial fishermen live off of so
shane lee and space lee being on a grouper boat they're not able to catch grouper and make money
with grouper because the price is so low at the fish house so it's not so much the ifq system that's
hurting them as it is just the price at the fish house of certain species that are popular on our
area there's not a lot of red grouper red snapper allocation out there to be leased and because of
its popularity the price of the lease is higher whereas red grouper the price of the lease is
super low because you can't make no money off them because the price of the fish house is so low
so it's it's a model to stock market because it's hard to catch right now there the commercial
fishermen are the ones standing at the council begging them to shut it down and cut quotas the
commercial fishermen are the ones doing it and they there's there's a problem in our red grouper
fishery right now and we're not seeing as many as we should whether that's a red tide issue or a
expansion of the red snapper biomass or one of the many other issues in our fishery accounting for
it or a little bit of everything but we're not seeing the red grouper that we saw in 2009 and
is that recent with grouper with red grouper yes i mean every fish every fishery is cyclical you'll
you'll have these up and downs where you see a huge abundance of the biomass and then all of a
sudden you have a uh a red tide event and heavy fishing and all of a sudden there's not as many
fish out there and the stock assessments really try to keep a handle on that whereas what we see on
the water isn't always what we see at the council for example with red snapper they're deemed over
fished but there's millions of red snapper out there everywhere that over fish designation is
because of msa or magnets and stevens and that's the that's what manages our fishery this law that
the congress made up and uh or that the senate made up and uh it's it's unfortunate but through
the years it's been reauthorized or changed twice in 1996 and again in 2007 and that 2007
authorization had a lot of driving force from the environmental groups and they made it mandatory
to rebuild fisheries and any fishery deemed over fish has to go under a mandatory rebuilding plan
and it created these buffers like acl's so you have an over fishing limit a stock assessment is
done and they have an over fishing limit that over fishing limit is called an OFL and let's say
they they determine through the stock assessment that you can fish to this limit anything higher
than that you're going to be over fishing anything under that your gold and the fishery can sustain
itself so that over fishing limit is set at like say a hundred pounds again easy example well then
the science and statistical committee will evaluate that and look at the scientific uncertainty in
the stat uh stock assessment and then they'll set a buffer to the abc or allowable biological
catch limit and that buffer is typically anywhere from five to twenty percent so now you went down
from a hundred pounds due to this buffer for the abc you're at seventy five pounds well then the
council will look at that abc and then they have to set an acl which was mandatory in the 2007
reauthorization that an acl or allowable catch limit is buffered down from the abc to account for
management uncertainty how fast are they going to be able to account for those landings and then
in things like the red snapper fishery where we have this huge catch and this derby fishery
there's an allowable catch target which is another buffer that is set for management
uncertainty again so you can have a hundred pounds of fish in the OFL that's what you can catch but
all these buffers once it's said and done you could be down to fifty pounds so that's the problem
and then when you exceed that fifty pounds and you land more than that you're considered overfishing
and when you overfish a bunch of times then you can be considered overfished mandatory
rebuilding plan and that hundred pounds that got turned to fifty pounds under a rebuilding plan gets
turned to twenty pounds and you're required by federal law to stay in that rebuilding plan until
the stock is rebuilt which takes twenty thirty years so right now red snappers in a rebuilding plan
there's red snapper everywhere and everybody agrees that red snapper fishing the fishery is
healthy and there's tons of red snapper out there but their their hands are tied because of that
rebuilding plan and luckily they just remove that overfish designation but that that's the problem
is all these buffers and the inability for fisheries managers to react quickly to trends that
fishermen see on the water because they're bound by science-based management they have to do the
science and they have to believe the science and we have one science center for three councils
so there's eight fishery management councils across the united states you have one up in new
england you have the mid-atlantic south Atlantic Caribbean Gulf of Mexico uh south pacific mid-
pacific north pacific and then hawaiian islands and guam and all that shit so you have all these
different councils and i think i was right i was look i know the gulf south Atlantic and
Caribbean well the other ones i don't know but uh you have these eight councils and like for example
in the pacific they'll have three science centers for one council whereas in our area the southeast
fishery science center in miami provides stock assessment analysis for the south Atlantic Council
Caribbean Council and the Gulf of Mexico and they handle highly migratory sharks and coastal
pelagics so you have five different people saying we need stock assessments on x y and z
to one place and the huge stress that it puts on that science center we have stock assessments
for example right now we're using a red grouper stock assessment and they're trying to assess
the stock of red grouper and they're using data the terminal year of the assessment is 2017 we're
about to go into 2019 and they're trying to assess the fishery based on 2017 and earlier data and then
once the stock assessment is done in mid 2019 it's going to take another year a year and a half for
the council to agree on management decisions so a lot of times when you have a management decision
made it's based on data that's already three years old yeah and that slow reaction to our
trends is a big problem that they're trying to adjust through ecosystem based management and
adjusting the stock assessment process to try to make it a little bit more streamlined the fishing
industry seems extremely complicated to me yeah um it does i mean what do you think it was like
before it got so complicated well you think it's better or i mean you know a lot of people
say the good old days and stuff yeah and the good old days were great it seems it seems extremely
crazy now to just catch fish the good old days were great i mean we had we had uh we were part of
the problem we helped over we kill a lot of fish a lot of fish uh and chains wanted in four different
states for killing fish yeah yeah i mean my grandfather has killed more fish than probably
most people in the u.s and uh i mean we had trips where you go out there and limit out bring the
boat home unload the fish go out there and limit out again come bring the boat home 130 or it was
a 32 hour trip when my grandfather alive was alive went out limited out came back and off
loaded twice and went back out so literally did three trips in one just because the fishing was
so hot right and we had trips where we loaded the the four fish boxes on the boat loaded the
bathrooms packed the shower and then started packing galley uh coolers full of fish because
there were we're running out of room and back in the day we had four fish boxes on that boat
nowadays we have two fish boxes because the fishing isn't the same and there's so many
regulations a lot of fish you have to toss back so uh and back in the day you had commercial
fishing before uh the late 80s uh you were allowed to sell recreationally caught fish so we had
back in the 60s and 70s when we ran this trip uh those trips you'd have 20 or 30 or 40 guys that
would go every trip every week 365 days a year yeah they'd come in and sell their fish and they
subsidize their habit and subsidize their hobby and they also made a little bit of money so you
could retire and fish every day for the rest of your life and you'd make money doing it
not no more and that was if you were good and that they made that illegal in the 80s uh mid to
late 80s and uh they really worked hard to root it out we really work hard to try to uphold that
because we can lose our boat we can lose our federal fishing permit which allows us access
to do what we do and uh they'll find you a lot of money and uh they did sting operations and
they really worked hard to root all that stuff out so it's definitely been interesting to watch
evolution even in my business because again when i when i when i wasn't alive my grandfather was
starting the company they would kill everything indiscriminately they killed tarpon they killed
manatees we had dolphins jesus we had dolphins caged up we did dolphin shows we taught them how
to do tricks the porpoise puff used to have a dolphin in there oh yeah a long time ago the dolphin
a fish tank in a bar yeah in the bar and then we got to the point where we started realizing
all right we can't we can't kill these things you can't we can't kill this as much but it was
still rampant i mean we overfished red snapper to the point of almost extinction in the Gulf of
Mexico now they have come back exponentially exponentially but we have to adjust to that and
we have to conserve our fishery and i want my grandson to be able to say well my my father had
the sustainable fishery it didn't go from killing everything to all right now we have nothing to
kill and in my grandfather's lifetime it came like that i mean black sea bass red snapper
gag grouper at one point a lot of these goliath grouper there was trips where we'd come back
with boatloads of jew fish or goliath grouper and nowadays you can't even take them out of the water
but yes they're gonna change that right because they're really overpopulated i heard that's a
whole nother podcast but uh it's the unfortunate part about goliath grouper is uh relates to
stock assessments because they can't do an accurate stock assessment without fisheries
independent data without a life cycle without age data and you can't get age data from a fish
without killing it uh they have to take the otolith which is the earbone out so they cut the head open
dig in between the eyes get this little tiny on a gag or on a goliath grouper these 800 pound
fish this thing is smaller than the head of a pencil and then they take it and they saw in
cross sections and put it under a microscope and it's like the rings of a tree and you can count
the rings and you get the age of the fish wow like down within a year plus or minus like very
accurately how long do those fish live normally uh off the top of my head i don't know but i would
guesstimate about excuse me about 15 to 20 years i mean they're pretty old fish a big 800
900 every time i've ever dove in the past five years there's been literally hundreds of jewish
yeah there's goliath grouper everywhere and it's becoming a huge problem because they eat everything
and uh i mean an 800 900 pound fish has to eat a lot of food to stay uh that's how big they are
yeah i've personally caught them in the 600 700 800 pound range they get to the size of like a
like a volkswagen bigger bigger i had a goliath grouper nearly tried to swallow me i was spear
fishing i had a fish on my belt and this goliath grouper came up and swallowed the fish and as he
did it swallowed my flipper and was coming up my leg and uh i can't say it on podcast but i had to
take emergency action to make sure that i wasn't drowned because i didn't i wasn't on scuba well if
you're if you're alive of course you have to freaking kill the fish yeah you were the fish right
yeah and it wasn't gonna be me it wasn't gonna be me and i mean these things there's so many countless
videos on youtube of spear fishermen down there fishing and these huge fish come out of nowhere
and just attack them to steal that fish and the problem is uh with this fish they were deemed
almost near extinction and it's not it's even above and beyond over fished and uh you have a
bunch of environmental groups that don't want to see them open for harvest and then also if it was
just environmental groups diving uh divers sport fishermen recreational commercial we could all
work together and uh get that fishery open most likely but the problem is is the diving industry
loves goliath grouper right because like you said before every dive you go on there's a bunch of
goliath grouper so if i'm a diving boat and i want to sell dive trips to go look at 20 30 800
pound fish is an easy dive for me yeah and it's a great dive for you so the diving industry is hugely
in opposition of opening a goliath grouper right and then you don't have a stock assessment because
you don't you have to have dead fish to do accurate science so the first step that we need to do and
hopefully the fwc will do in the near future is they need to open a scientific quota or scientific
allowable catch so the scientists can go out there kill these fish bring them home take them to the
florida wildlife research institute and do the information and data collection that they need
to create a fisheries independent stock assessment and then we open a lottery system like alligators
say all right there's going to be 400 goliath grouper across the state of florida allowed to be
killed yeah here's the tags enter your name here if you win the lottery you get a tag and then that
based with mandatory reporting so you catch that goliath grouper you have to call the fwc and report
your catch tell them where you're going to be so they can send a scientist out so now you have
fisheries independent and fisheries dependent data and after a year or two of that they'd be able to
do an accurate stock assessment tell us how many fish there are and i would guarantee you there would
be seriously relaxed regulation on them after they accomplish that but the only way to do that is
with fwc and everybody working together that's the biggest problem in our fishery is it really
upsets me when a commercial guy's saying well the recreational guys are going over their quota
that's the problem and the recreational guys sitting over here saying well that commercial
guys catching all those fish and killing everything and that's the problem for the season
and you have all this point finger pointing and blame and the only way that we're going to succeed
at bettering our fisheries management is by working together and uniting a commercial
fisherman a for hire recreational and a private recreational fisherman have to sit at a table
like this and try to reach agreements and then approach the fisheries management council and
say this is what we want right and as a unified voice it would pass with flying colors but the
problem is there's no unified voice and that that is my goal is to provide an open access public
fishery uh where fishing sectors can unite and agree upon issues and hopefully all be able to
prosecute our fisheries in the best way that each sector needs to uh while having the access to do
so and at first and most importantly preserving that fishery that's fine i just i just remembered
who was it dean from savon yeah was telling me he had a website and he was bragging he's like
i have this really bad ass website everyone goes to it every day it has all the the data
about the ifqs on there and he's like i got some hot chicks you can look at on bikinis they're
hanging out in the corner of the website what what is that similar to kind of what you're talking
is he trying to do the same thing i mean what what is his website called uh i know there's boats in
quota uh that's a real that's what it was called boats in quota yeah and that's because my friend
kyle was telling me about that too he goes on there all the time kyle chevus yeah and kyle
chevus and kody chevus go there to get quota because that's a place that you lease quota there or
yeah that's the idea is okay you buy and sell both look at all the hot girls oh hell yeah
but this is purely for uh see if you scroll to the bottom you can see the association the gulf
fisherman's association okay this is strictly commercial based because yes this is all about
allocation and quota this is how you can lease quota like see there the prices so this is all
about leasing quota uh so this is not what i was just talking about but this is great for the
commercial fishery because it allows them to prosecute their fishery more because if you own
a commercial boat and you want to go out fishing and you don't have someone to lease you quota you
can go on this website and find a place to lease you okay it's like a market it's like a marketplace
it's a Walmart of quota so they own the quota they do not own the quota they allow so they like
middleman yeah i got you okay yeah what i have is i have a interesting uh a facebook group called
fishermen united and that's where i tried to relay some information but it's it's really really
frustrating because anything i post turns into a he said she said or the commercial fisherman's fault
and then the commercial guys start arguing with the recreational guys yeah it seems so divided
everyone like yeah everyone points their fingers at the other person completely opposite side of
the conversation and it seems like there's no one in the middle that you know i mean that can yeah
and a lot of people are in it for uh very selfish reasons and a lot of people are there to better
their business better their access and they don't give a fuck about anybody else and that's not how
we reach an agreement that's not how we work together that's not how we better our fishery so
that is my goal but i'm i'm still new to this i started going to the golf council meetings two
years ago i'm still a young guy and uh you seem like you know everything about the fishing industry
rattled off more than i've ever heard about fishing in my life i haven't even started i can tell
so what was it like growing up a little bit then to slow it down and like being a part of the
Hubbard's marina or like as a kid and when did you get into the business and all that yeah
i mean uh i bought my first boat when i uh just about after i turned nine years old
and you bought your first boat yeah yeah i um it took me two years uh i i asked i'm i have three
sisters i'm the only boy in the family and uh my sisters um and myself were kind of raised
differently in my opinion uh but uh i i asked my dad when i was seven hey can i get a boat
i want i want to get a boat and he was like well you can get a fucking job then you can get a boat
and uh i started working started what time no i started first uh doing lawn mowing okay and then
i uh would uh prairie dog my sister's babysitting gigs when they were busy yeah i would uh jump
in there and uh i did whatever i could to make a buck yeah i caught caught and sold bait on the dock
i uh did laundry for my mom i did babysitting i mowed lawns uh whatever it took to make a dollar
and uh i bought my first boat when i turned nine uh for 980 bucks and uh how big was it it was a
17-foot carolina skiff with a nissan tahatu 40-horse motor that broke down every time i went
every time every time yeah you could count on it for one thing and that was getting you stranded
and uh it was it was a cool way to first it taught me the value of a dollar and the value of work
ethic and you're not you don't you don't appreciate something as much in my opinion if someone just
buys it for you if you go out there work your ass off and earn it it's uh very different yeah it was
really cool uh for me looking back when i was there i hated my dad for making me go out and work and
do all this stuff but i mean looking back it taught me a lot about life and uh it was cool and i
i used that boat for a lot of crazy shenanigans you still have it my friends uh i just sold it
about two years ago okay um but yeah i didn't want to sell it but uh i used it mostly to keep
making money i used it to catch a bait and sell bait i got a commercial fishing license
uh for saltwater products which was the ability to catch pen fish and sell them at what age uh nine
at nine years old you did that yeah that's awesome uh so it was really cool to uh be able to go out
there after school and make a buck uh on my boat uh and i really was kind of introverted in that
aspect because i was just only interested in going out in the boat and then uh i got a little older
and kind of got a little bit out of the uh industry out of the business and uh started
doing things kids do and playing video games and sure and acting crazy and uh through high school
wasn't as involved but then towards the end of high school started getting back into it and uh
working on the boats in summer and uh just addicted to fishing i have been since i was a kid and um
in college uh or i guess back up to mid-high school uh i started getting back into the
fishery i i i said that wrong i started getting back into the fishery in like ninth grade like
end of middle school and i i worked full time nearly at the marina after school and on the
weekends and on the summer and then uh when i turned 16 my dad fired me uh and and uh it was for
nothing left nothing other than uh he wanted me to go work for someone else and see what it was
like to work for someone else because when he was growing up him and his family they just
expected to work in the family business and they they that was their thing and they they did so a
lot he watched a lot of people like that yeah he watched his family's his brother and sister's
mistakes and he felt that some of his family members worked in the family business just for the
validation from their father and um he didn't want to do that he wanted to make sure that i knew
what it was like to work for someone else uh learn what a good manager looks like and a bad
manager looks like and and learn my own life experiences and uh it was really cool again
hated him at the time for it but looking back it was a very intelligent wise thing to do and it
enabled me to go different places and do a different thing and see if that's what i wanted to do
because i i went to school in Orlando purely for the fact that i wanted to get away from the water
and see what it was like somewhere else right yeah like two weeks into school i started bass fishing
for the first time because i couldn't sit in Orlando not fish yeah so uh after three years of school
i was um managed or i was uh majoring in business management with a minor in hospitality management
with the mindset of i'm going to go to school for four years and i'm going to come back and
tackle this business stuff and uh my plan was to come back from school be a deck hand
become a work up to be able to come in a captain and then step into the office role
and learn the office part of the business but uh things take turns you know and life you can't
make plans and uh i ended up getting in my senior year of college i was a bouncer in college so i
spent a lot of time at the bar and uh chasing girls and stuff i ended up meeting my wife uh at
a bar she was drinking underage and caught her drinking underage and told her i wouldn't kick
her out she gave me her number and there you go seven years later we're married and that's awesome
and uh it just it got to a point where i i wasn't focused on school and i wanted to get home and uh
ended up uh finishing with an AA and a minor in hospitality management but didn't finish my BA i was
like eight credits shy yeah and uh came home did what i wanted to do like i said i wanted to become
a deck hand then a captain then learn the office side of things but i was uh super into weightlifting
and being a crazy kid and i ended up hurting my back really bad uh doing something stupid on the
boat so after like three years of working full or two years of working full time as a deck hand
after college uh this injury occurred and uh it pretty much sidelined me so it took me off the boat
i had to go through serious back surgery once recovering from that i couldn't go do what i
wanted to do and be a deck hand and i couldn't be on a boat so i started working in the office uh
as a reservationist just answering phones and doing grunt work and then i became a manager
and then i slowly became the general manager and then i slowly became the vice president and now
i'm the vice president co-owner of the company and pretty much handle operations completely
kicked my dad out of the office and uh i enjoy it and i ended up being pretty good at it and um
yeah you seem like you're very good at it so what i could see so far and it's i really enjoy uh my
grandfather everybody always says how cool the guy was and how he uh was so nice and outgoing and
talkative and uh i really enjoy talking to people you you get someone new from out of town talk to
them get them hooked up what to do for their vacation and and see that progression of them
coming into town knowing nothing now they know how to fish they're hooked on fishing and they
want to come back next year and fish with us at helvards marina and then i get a lot of enjoyment
out of that and so now um after moving into the office uh originally when my back injury occurred
i i was slow to get back on the boats but after two two and a half years or so i was finally back
to being healthy and i started working on the boats again and ended up getting my captain's license
when i was 22 you have to be 21 to get that license and i waited till i was 22 and uh went out
and got the license and started running boats when i was about 23 uh so it's been about five years or
so and uh it's it's been fun it's a lot of fun to work in the office and talk to people and
get people on the boat and it's a lot of fun to take them out on the boat too and uh watch that full
range uh and full progression but nowadays i struggle just to be able to uh have time to breathe
but it's a very in my opinion a great blessing to be as busy as i am and balancing my home life
with my wife and hopefully kids in the future and balancing my life at work balancing operations and
then trying to get out in the boat and then also now i travel with the golf council i'm i go to all
council meetings so that's five week long meetings every year at five different golf states so
every two to three months i'm gone for a whole week in another state at these meetings and then a
lot of times they'll have other meetings like stock assessment meetings uh ap meetings and all these
other meetings that i have to attend so i'm at these meetings 30 40 50 days a year uh while trying
to manage my office and uh business and it's it's been a challenge but it's it's something i love to
do and i'm passionate about fishing i'm passionate about uh fisheries management and fishery
preservation and also getting people hooked on fishing so that's cool i'm blessed to do what i love
you know right you do what you love and you're never going to work a day in your life and i
sometimes it feels like work occasionally but most of the time it's what i love are your siblings
as involved as you are your sisters in the business and everything or uh i mean up until
two years ago no not at all but uh uh they all have their own uh their own thing you know yeah
one sister started her own business and was an entrepreneur while traveling the world one sister
was uh in washington dc making waves rubbing shoulders with congressmen and everybody you
know and uh was in a really powerful position as a fundraiser uh and now she came back and she's
working with us uh she helped my dad work with city management to get uh waterborne transportation
in our area a reality and uh that was pretty cool to see that and it's great to work with family
yeah besides my family my direct family my my cousin uh is the captain on one of the boats my other
cousin uh works at our uh boat building uh operation and helps us build boats and then
i have other cousins that work in our family's restaurant um and it's it's nice to be able
to work with family it's really really tough sometimes but yeah i bet it's rewarding i like
you you're saying that you go to um multiple different states on in the golf surrounding the
golf um to deal with like conserving the fisheries and maintaining the fisheries and stuff um
um dean was telling me he was when i years ago when i filmed that a couple years when i filmed
that he was showing me pictures and showing me an article about how he had traveled to
washington dc multiple times um i don't know if that was it had anything to do with the fisheries
or if that was specifically about quotas and like the i was probably for the i of q system because
the i of q system was driven and funded by the environmental defense fund an ng o environmental
ng o and their uh idea behind it was consolidation and more accountability so anything like that the
environmental groups are going to get behind so that edf pu a bunch of these environmental groups
helped fund these fishermen and create this idea of this program and then they funded those
fishermen to go lobby for this program uh so a lot of guys spent a lot of time lobbying congressmen
senators and uh everybody to try to accept the system and most people involved in the
process were on board five qs some had different ways of going about it i'm not a commercial
fisherman and uh i'm speaking on this based on things that i've talked to other commercial
fishermen about um but you can't argue with the result of accountability right safety at sea
and uh consolidation it did what it's supposed to do now that call consolidation is terrible for
the people that got consolidated because again we went from 500 boats in midir beach to 50 boats
yeah and that is a lot of lost livelihoods a lot of lost businesses a lot of lost people right and
you take a guy like chain lee and take away his job what's going to happen to him nothing good
yeah because they i mean they say themselves say that you can't do anything else you can't get a job
anywhere else you can be a deckhand yeah i mean look look at that i mean you can't go get a job
at kinko's i mean you know you you can't go get a job in donald's right uh go be a deckhand yeah
so i mean it really has unfortunately caught a lot of people up in that system because even both
of them aren't even fishing now deckhands like that weren't at these council meetings they didn't
know where it was coming it was one day a light switch got turned on and their whole life got
turned upside down so it you think that's fair for them or is it just kind of it is what it is
i i can't speak to that you know i mean i don't think it was fair a fairness is all in your
perception right that that question it really has to do with your viewpoint and what uh what your
point of view is i mean was it fair to the environmental groups yeah i mean they got their
consolidation accountability and everything worked out was it fair to the people who were at that
meeting that new oh shit i gotta go save a bunch of money and sell my house and leverage everything
and gamble my whole life on getting a bunch of allocation worked out for them but it could have
gone the other way too and uh it it's just all in your perception i mean if if you're motivated
involved you can you can use it selfishly unfortunately yeah but i try to really share
what happens like for example we have this electronic reporting thing that i'm telling you
about earlier and how next year i have to have a vessel monitoring system and i worked with
an environmental group to hold a meeting here to educate my fellow charter boat and party boat
guys because right now there's a uh there's a program where you can sign up and become a volunteer
and get a free three thousand dollar unit but you have to get off your ass show up to a meeting
learn what it's about and get that three thousand dollar unit or you can wait till next year don't
want to do that they'll complain i didn't get the wait till next year and then they'll bitch let
they have to spend yeah smoke too much weed chain you didn't show up yeah i gotta pay three grand
stop bitching and there's i'm scared to even go out and fish in the backyard now after i'll just talk
about all that i'm not even catching nothing no more management not state management so
state waters and that's another confusing thing is everything we're talking about applies to federal
fishing so federal fishing starts at nine miles if you're fishing inside well yeah i don't even make
it past the sandbar yeah i've never even been out on a boat like that at all oh we can change
diving or anything i don't know it sounds crazy you told me almost got eaten by a six hundred
pound fish i'm pretty good bro well that's beer fishing it's crazy it is crazy that both shane
and space aren't fishing anymore yeah and shane is doing like some crazy thing where he was showing
us pictures he's doing red tide drives on these like these boats that have atvs on them and these
boats pull up on the beach and they drive the atvs off the boat docked onto the sand and they
drive up and down like mile long strips of the beach and pick up dead fish he said that's all he
does he says he makes a ton of money doing it yeah right now let's talk about that on the podcast
by the way so yeah i don't know why he didn't want i don't know they don't want people to know about
it because right now you can uh the red tide clean up they're just pouring money into cleaning up
red tide which is interesting and it's really cool because there's a lot of money going into it
you can make 17 dollars a day as a complete you can be a triple felon three time loser and you
can go out and get a job making 17 dollars an hour not a day i apologize i was gonna say that was
cheap 17 dollars an hour and then if you're a deckhand on a boat you can get 20 dollars an hour
and then if you're a captain on the boat you can get 30 an hour plus 250 day 250 dollars a day for
your boat to clean up to clean up so there's a lot of guys that using their charter boats quit
charter fishing to do red tide clean up and if you do 20 250 dollars an hour if you make 30
dollars an hour work at the 12 hour day and you get 250 bucks that's a big paycheck yeah yeah and
i mean if you're a felon that's flipping burgers at mcdonald's or you can't get a job anywhere
else like space and uh shane uh shane going and make 17 dollars an hour to walk the beach and pick
up dead fish is a killing yeah and you do that for 12 hours a day and they've been doing it for
almost two months so i mean they're just bank rolling and uh it's the red tide cleanup has been
very lucrative for the people involved in it but there's only a very small minority involved
and it was very hush hush yeah he was like uh they they wouldn't let him talk about the names of the
companies and like they don't want to be advertised who they're working for because it's so much money
yeah i mean if you if you don't show up for work and there's a line out the door of people waiting
for work you're going to lose your job if you don't show up yeah but if no one knows about it
no one knows how to get involved in it then you have a little bit of job security and right now
they are at when it first happened they hired a bunch of people and then they were firing people
who weren't working as hard and hiring new people because there were so many people waiting in line
but nowadays there's not as many people waiting in line so you can relax and buck off you don't
have to work as hard and you're not going to get fired so they don't want them they don't want to
advertise it for that reason in my opinion and it seems like they're dumping a ton of money into a
band-aid right i mean they're dumping a ton of money into picking up fish and throwing them in a
dumpster i mean to make it look like they could put their money somewhere else to try to stop it at
the source maybe yeah red tide has been around since forever uh the 1500s there's actually documented
from back in the spanish days uh where the gulf was red and the gulf was dead there's
nothing in the gulf i mean that was like legit thing from like columbus era era and the 60s
the 70s we had huge red tides but long story short it's always around i was talking to a
panellas county red tide expert who's been doing red tide sampling in panellas county three times
a week 365 days a year for last 15 years and he's never taken a sample that didn't have a red tide
organism count to it right so it's always here but when you have nutrients present and you have a
mature concentrated bloom you have fish kills and so right now we have a lot of nutrients in the water
from all the municipalities growing out of control and all this new concrete and all these toilets
that our sewer systems can't overflow like st p has a sewage overflow like every month and so all
that sewage with all this red tide and all this hot water that's blooming these concentrated
blooms of mature cells just it's like throwing lighter fluid on a fire and then just explode so
as far as what your question was or what your statement is putting a band-aid on it well if you
kill a million pounds of fish and you have that million pounds of fish sitting along the seashore
in shallow hot water that decomposing fish is a lot of nutrients so the idea is you pick up all
the dead fish in the water and take them out of the water you're not only fixing the smell and
helping to stem the hurt to the tourism industry but you're also taking those nutrients out of
the water and taking that decomposition and rotting fish out of the water so that's the idea behind
not so much a band-aid but it's preventative in a way if you look at it and kind of squint and
turn your head yeah but it's also a in my opinion a tourism thing in all county where a hundred
percent tourism driven and right if you if you're surrounded on all three sides by rotting dead fish
car right you don't want to get tourists yeah into the area so it's it's to help get the dead
fish out of the water but it's also to help keep people on the beach i heard that it was
the the runoff from the um pesticides like in the middle of Florida near like Okeechobee and
yeah i mean it didn't help i mean the this red tide started back in October 2017 behind Irma Irma
had all that uh heavy rain and craziness down there and this red tide uh occurred around south
of Fort Myers north of Everglades city and it started in October 2017 and then we moved into
spring water got hotter and then these discharges started happening and as the water got harder
you could argue that the water just got warmer and then allowed the bloom to grow right but i mean
if you have a smoldering you have a smoldering fire over here and you take a candle lighter fluid
and dump it on it right explode and that was the i in my opinion uneducated fishermen uh
if you have this discharge of all this fresh water because when you lower the salinity algae
can grow much better so just allowing fresh water into the gulf is going to create more red tide and
help a red tide that's already there grow bigger then fresh water yes when you lower the salinity
plants can grow better algae can grow better red tides and algae so okay then you take that fresh
water that you're dumping into the gulf of Mexico and you add a bunch of nutrients to it whether
that's phosphate or whatever other chemicals and runoff sewage all those septic lines along the
Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie and Okeechobee river and Okeechobee lake all those sewage pipes all the
runoff from the sugar industry there's multiple different causes right and then you take this
blue green algae that we cause that's man-made it's not naturally occurring like red tide
and that blue green algae is a freshwater algae it does not occur in fresh salt water and any salt
water kills it so it's just like the dead fish you take all this algae all these nutrients all this
fresh water and you dump it in a salt water well the algae dies in rots which causes more nutrients
fresh water allows it to grow better and then all the nutrients is just like lighter fluid
so this whole thing started in the springs and it hit that mature because again remember
you need nutrient rich water and you need mature cells so you had these mature cells that had been
around for four or five months and are old and badass and then you pour a bunch of nutrients
into the water and boom we have a huge nasty red tide event that slowly moved north and got worse
and worse and worse is this the worst you've seen it uh no 2005 was a much worse red tide it was
yeah i've seen it way worse too just surfing around here like being in the water like i remember
in past years like literally having my eyes burning so bad and this year i mean i've been
out in the water in the past three or four months and it has at least in panellas county
it hasn't been that bad and now you have to also take into account that this is the first time
they've ever picked up dead fish in 2005 there was no red tide cleanup so the those fish died and
just sat there and rotted now this year they're picking them up and what you said as far as your
eyes watering and stuff like that that's a red tide symptom that's the brevetoxin that's released
when red tide gets really bad and it passes away and so that symptom is cured because we've had a
lot of east wind that east wind pushes all those brevetoxin off the coast and you don't have any
effect so you could be surfing and you're not going to cough and gag and have itchy watery eyes you
know and then a lot of people equate dead fish with red tide if i see a dead fish float no there's
red tide there yeah no not always a dead fish at when a fish dies it sinks yeah and then it rots
decomposes the gaseous build up and that fish makes it float so when you see a fish floating
it was dead two days ago three days ago and most of the fish you see are rotten so they've been
dead for a week so you see this huge bloom of dead fish and the news crews are out there saying oh
red tide so bad yeah that's not fucking red tide right that's a symptom of red tide news they go
scoop up yeah they can find bury themselves i fucking watch them do it in my conchos backyard
i was yeah in my i was i was doing a red tide interview two or three times a day for like three
weeks straight when this whole thing starts on the news and i watched the news crews
zoom in on these on these four dead fish and i mean fox sir team when this thing first started
there was just a few dead bait fish but we had a really strong new moon tide and that new moon
tide was flushing all this water out of the past so whenever you have these heavy tides yeah natural
when there's no red tide around you have a big defined line the bay water will be dark brown
sometimes we have heavy rains the gulf water will be greenish blue or sometimes just blue
so fox sir team was flying over this brownish black water meeting this blue water and on the
edge of that when there's no red tide there's a bunch of debris and foam and sea light and
and they were flying over this with the few dead fish gathered in obviously there was some red
tide fish killed but it was very minor and they're flying over it saying look at the water that's
pouring the toxic water pouring into the gulf when in reality was completely natural with a very
minor fish kill and that that that unfortunate uh sensational journalism really hurt us and then
it made national news and national news all they said is the coast of florida the west coast of
florida is engulfed with toxic tide and toxic tide this toxic tide that and all they would ever say
is the west coast of florida the southwest coast of florida they never said i mean from march until
july it was all south of sarasota county there was nothing in anna maria john's past in the tri
county area but we were ostracized or politicized into it that we were wrapped into it and then we
started feeling the effects uh with lower head counts and less people in the area and then when
it actually hit here i mean it was just like it was like heyday i mean people came from all over to
take video and say how bad penance county was and then it just went to shit i mean september is a
slow month but this past september was terrible yeah how much did it affect your business our
business i mean our red tide has zero effect on our offshore fishing business even in 2005 when
red tide was at the worst when it was 15 20 miles out you've just fished beyond it and the fish are
healthy you can still eat them even not even that though like a couple of my friends that um run
commercially they commercially pull like pull and sell stone crabs like my friend rj um he's been
getting more crabs than he's gotten in the past couple years red tide does a few bigger red tide
does a few things and one things that it does do is it increases the shrimp and crab harvest the
following year well it actually increases the catchability because uh red tide is like a wall
and that wall was traveling north pushing all these crabs in front of it so now all these guys
are fishing ahead of that wall of red tide and they're catching more crabs more quickly more
easily and the same thing in 2014 we had some of the best red grouper catches we've ever had
because this epicenter of red grouper population was hit with red tide and it pushed all those
grouper into this structure we were out there I mean some commercial guys were having nine
10 000 pound trips where a normal trip is two thousand three thousand pounds so it was literally
tripling the catch rate and catchability of these fish so red tide I mean we saw in uh early
september as the red tide kind of pushed into our area we got a huge push a gag grouper we're
catching monster gags at a time of year where you don't see gags that big that close to shore
it really makes fish move because most fish can move out of the way of it I mean I see it in
john's pass all the time well the depending on the wind and the current we'd have beautiful clear
crystal clear water filled with fish yeah the next day would be blood red everything's dead yeah but
towards the end of the red tide once it had been around for one or two weeks you didn't see fish
kills it's not because all the fish were dead because one day it'd be crystal clear fish are
everywhere the next day it's red and there's no dead fish because these fish are learning
and they adapt to their surroundings and they can go up into long bayou or cross bayou and way up
there in the mouth of the rivers and these estuaries where red tide hasn't affected and can't affect
because red tide is salt water estuaries are mainly freshwater the salinity is too low for red
tide to affect it well I've been eating a ton of fish and a ton of stone crabs does it taint the fish
yeah it does not or the crabs or anything uh shellfish in red tide affected areas can cause
serious injury or death to a human but you have to eat a lot of it and you have to have a bio
accumulation of brevetoxin a fish the muscle of the fish or the filet that we eat is 120 000
percent safe from the worst red tide affected areas and that's straight from florida wildlife
institute I mean fish are safe and healthy to eat but you're saying it's safe to go in the water
shellfish oysters right no no that's a crustacean okay uh shellfish like oysters clams that kind of
stuff oh yeah if you went and ate an oyster out of the red tide affected area well one probably
wouldn't make you too sick but you might throw up but if you ate us if you ate a couple dozen of them
you'd fucking die yeah because they're filter feeders and they they filter all that stuff out
and that's that's what they they just suck that's what they do yeah wow yeah so but after a few months
that that bio accumulation level has worked through their body and they're safe to eat again so
it's not like it ruins the area and just makes them unhealthy to eat in red tide affected areas
right but the fish are healthy the crabs are healthy and we're catching plenty of fish you
just got to get out on the boat and try it and get past it yeah because even our shortest closest
to short trip is well past the red tide affected area wow man I learned a lot today that's great
yeah fishing is very uh it's a very very intense industry man yeah I mean there's a lot that goes
into it and it's as intense as you want it to be yeah you go out there and soak a line drink a beer
and have a good time or you can get really involved and stake your livelihood on the fishery and then
you have to get a little bit more intense yeah it's cool it's cool to see you at 27 so knowledgeable
about it and so respectful of the industry and the fisheries and everything yeah I appreciate you
coming out and you're doing a lot and I appreciate taking care of the community and you know trying
to educate as many people as you can there's a lot of cool resources out there I mean myself
like I said I only got into this two years ago and I didn't really honestly know that much I mean I
grew up listening to my dad and my dad is a really good businessman and he's a really good at what he
does but when it comes to science and all that is not not as not as not his strong suit but uh
he joined organizations and listened to other people and I grew up around some really sensationalized
really heavy-duty agenda-driven individuals and I was kind of had a warped view of the fish
a very one-sided bias view yeah the fisheries management system so getting involved in the
process and kind of learning all the players and their teams and their agendas was really eye opening
for me and I I really take advantage of the resources that are there like my favorite thing
that I've done is the marine resource education program it's a three-day workshop twice a year
so it's six days total you go through that six-day work those six days and you graduate that marine
resource education program you're gonna have a and it's like going to fisheries management college
in six days it's really really cool and it was very eye opening for me and I've been blessed
to do it twice so going through that twice has really really taught me a lot and then just
doing my research so it's really cool but I I definitely appreciate the compliments but it's
all due to the people that I've been blessed to surround myself with cool well check out the
hubbers marina and the website and uh what you got a youtube show yeah yeah we have uh facebook
youtube instagram i run all our social media and online marketing myself so when you message our
page you message me directly and uh we do a live fishing show every sunday night at 8 30 pm for an
hour uh the first half is where we show photos and videos of what we've been doing that week
second half is where we answer our guests and viewers questions live on air is that on facebook
or youtube facebook and youtube we stream to seven channels at once so we stream yeah it's pretty cool
and we can do the screen shares it's it's gotten pretty advanced hey yeah and then i do a radio
show every two radio shows every weekend and then i have a bass pro seminar every week or every month
damn yeah damn you got it all going man give you a healthy dose of dylan
yes sir cool man well thank you for coming on dylan hey no problems remember we'll catch up with you
soon yeah you gotta remember the family motto if you're too busy to go fishing you're just too
darn busy all right hey man we'll see if you can get me to catch a fish sometime man for sure all
right problem all right bro thank you
