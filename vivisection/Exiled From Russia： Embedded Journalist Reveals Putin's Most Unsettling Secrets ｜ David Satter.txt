Describe how you became the first American journalist to be exiled from Russia.
Well that took place in 2013 and basically I had gone to Ukraine before of course there
was no war at that time. I went to Kiev to renew my visa. This is a standard bureaucratic
procedure. I had all the necessary documents and the rule is the same for everybody. You
have to leave the country, get it renewed and then come back in. I had an apartment
in Moscow. I was accredited in Moscow. I was planning to live there and stay there.
And I was informed by a diplomat in the Russian Embassy in Kiev that my presence on the territory
of the Russian Federation was undesirable, that this had been the conclusion of the so-called
competent organs. That's a euphemism for the FSB, the Federal Security Service, which
is the successor organization to the KGB. And I was banned from entering the country.
So I couldn't go back. All my things were there. In the end my son went to Moscow and
packed up my things and brought them back out. And that was it. The Moscow Times, which
is an English language paper in Moscow, wrote an article about it. They said it wasn't surprising
that I was expelled. It was surprising that it took so long.
Really?
Yeah. And in fact I have a long, long record of confrontation with the Russian authorities
and then the Soviet authorities before them because I went to Russia for the first time
as a correspondent in 1976. At that point the very young correspondent of the London
Financial Times. And in 1979 there was an attempt to expel me, which failed. It was based on
the idea or based on the assumption that neither the British Embassy nor the American
Embassy, since I was an American working for a British publication, and in those years
that was very unusual, would defend me. But in fact they both did. And they threatened
to expel Russian journalists from both London and Washington. And those Russian journalists
were in fact intelligence agents and they didn't want to lose them. So they allowed me
to stay in Moscow. And I was able to remain there for three more years to work on a book
which eventually was published. I had intended it to be about the Soviet totalitarian system.
Because history kind of began to move very fast it was ultimately about the fall of the
Soviet totalitarian system. And after that I couldn't go back for a number of years.
I was blocked when I tried to travel to the Soviet Union. But in the last years of the
Soviet Union after the Gorbachev reforms had gone very, very far, I was finally allowed back in.
I was the last American journalist to be allowed back in and it turns out I was the first to be
expelled in post-Soviet Russia. But between the time that I was allowed in and the time that I was
expelled there were 20, 23 years that I was going back and forth and writing about Russia.
I wrote other books. What made you interested in going over to Russia in the first place?
And was there any suspicion from Russia that you could have been in US intelligence?
There's always that suspicion. But they have extremely thorough ways of keeping track
of Western journalists. For one thing we lived in the Soviet times in buildings that were bugged
and where there were video cameras and where there were guards outside the buildings and where
everyone who came and went was registered and observed.
We didn't have mobile phones in those days, but the phones were all tapped. The only way to have a
private conversation was to go to a booth and put a two-cope coin into a tin telephone and try to
dial a number. In fact, it was quite an effort actually to get the damn telephone even to
work, let alone to get through to somebody. But if you called from your home then everything was
of course monitored. So they knew pretty well what correspondents were doing, with whom we were
meeting. Intelligence agents are really, although there's a lot of mythology about this, their
principal job is to recruit sources. And that means, for example, finding people who worked
in the Russian or Soviet government who could provide secret information. Everything I did
was open and public. And I didn't make any such efforts to establish such contacts.
The other thing was that all of the driver's secretaries, maids, and service personnel
in the foreigners' buildings all worked for the KGB at that time. So it's hard to conceal very much
from them. And in fact, I had no interest in doing that. I thought that I wanted to make it clear
that I was operating openly and according to the law, and that I had a legitimate right as a
representative of the Western press and the democratic world, in effect, to gather truthful
information to make it known. What sparked your interest to originally go over there?
And how old were you when you first went over there? When I first went over there, I was a
graduate student. I was a graduate student. It was actually in 1969. I'll tell you how old I was,
so you at that time was 21. Wow. Yeah. And I went there because I was a graduate student at Oxford
University in England. And I had always been interested in Russia. And then when I went to
study at Oxford, suddenly Russia was close. I mean, you could get on a train in London. Of
course, you had to get off the train to get on a ferry and then take the ferry to the Hook of
Holland and pick up another train. But nonetheless, you could buy a ticket in London and take a train
that would eventually lead you to Moscow. And I didn't want to miss that opportunity. I went
there many times, not many times, but a number of times, spend as much time in the Soviet Union as
I could and just became fascinated with the place and with the language. The language. Yeah,
it was Russian language. Because I went to a high school in Chicago on the south side of
Chicago and it was in the neighborhood of the University of Chicago. And it was a crazy coincidence
but there was a woman there who taught Russian. And the high school students had the option of
we had a choice. It was French, Spanish, German, Latin, or Russian. And I
asked my father at that time. I was 13. I asked him, what language do you think I should take?
He said, I think you should take Russian. It might be useful someday. I couldn't imagine
how it could be useful because I knew even at that age that very few people were able to go
to the Soviet Union that to live there you had to be part of a special diplomatic community.
It never crossed my mind at that time that I might one day be part of that community,
but that's what happened. And I also did something which I would actually advise
any student to do, which is I didn't quit. Many of the people who took Russian gave up on it.
It's a difficult language. Many of them decided, oh heck, I'm not going to struggle with this.
I'll study Spanish. In the case of people who had a language requirement that they had to fulfill.
But after four years of high school Russian, during which I didn't learn very much,
I thought that, well look, I still have a little bit of background and why not build on it. So I
took Russian when I went to the University of Chicago because to graduate from the University
of Chicago in those days you had to have at least one year of a foreign language. And then when I
got to Oxford I continued. And then, needless to say, I got practice when I traveled there.
And I spent one summer at a, taking a special Russian course that was organized by the
British Soviet Friendship Society and I signed up for it. So little by, the point is little by
little I improved my knowledge of Russian and so that when I went to Moscow I had a base.
And of course I worked hard with a tutor and finally, finally got to the point that every
journalist should get to, where I could go out and talk to people in their own language
and kind of circulate as almost as if I were a Soviet citizen.
What was your, during that time, what was your perspective on Russia and Russian people
and did you have like any sort of like goals in mind when you went to Moscow?
My goal was to learn about the country and to write about it.
I had at this, when I was at Oxford I wrote a thesis on, well let's put it this way.
You know, I grew up in the, you know, as part of the post-war generation and particularly as
a Jewish kid growing up in Chicago, I was very concerned about the Holocaust and the destruction
of the European Jews by the Nazis and actually I was trying, from a very early age I tried to
understand why that happened and what did it say about people that such a thing could take place
and you have to understand that I lived in a neighborhood in Chicago where there were a lot
of people who had survived the Holocaust and they told these terrible stories about what had happened
to them and so that information was there for me growing up and so my first thought was maybe I would
take an interest in Nazi Germany but in fact I began to think well first of all I don't speak
German and second of all well Nazism is part of the past but in the Soviet Union you have a totalitarian
regime which is in some ways similar and you can actually go there, you can go there and see
how people live and what and what's going on and of course this the fact that I had studied
Russian in high school and I had some background and I had always been interested to read about
Russia so all of these things prompted me to to focus on Russia while I was at Oxford I wrote a
thesis on the theory of totalitarianism of Hannah Arendt who is a leading political philosopher maybe
the outstanding theorist of totalitarianism and I came to the conclusion that Nazism and you know
extreme Stalinism as it existed in the Soviet Union were basically the two variants of the same
phenomenon and so therefore I really it it really did make sense everything kind of pushed me in the
direction of trying to go to Moscow plus the fact of course that I had I had been editor of the school
paper at University of Chicago the campus newspaper and I had had some successes in as a journalist
so all of these things came together and and it seemed the thing to do was to go to
to the Soviet Union write about the Soviet Union try to understand it better and maybe try to help
other people understand it but of course there was still a great deal I didn't understand there was
a great deal I didn't know the fact that I had written that thesis on Hannah Arendt was a huge
help because she did something that very few thinkers were able to do was that she kind of
explained the mechanism of totalitarianism and that meant that when I got to Moscow as a correspondent
I was in a somewhat different position than the other correspondents I would first of all I was
the youngest or practically the youngest in fact it was really strange people to see someone that
young rep in Moscow representing the financial times of London but but more to the point I had
this theoretical and intellectual background so the things that that that took place in the Soviet
Union in Moscow were not that surprising to me I could make sense of the idea that an entire
society had been created to realize a false idea this is which was you know the the
uh the concept of Hannah Arendt was that totalitarianism is the combination of ideology
a false idea and terror in other words you take a false idea and you use terror
to compel people to act it out and then you create an entire false for universe of false
appearances uh in order to confirm the validity of the ideology so I get you know so this is just
too crazy for words and the average American or British correspondent including people who are
a lot older than I was they got there and they they they they couldn't figure out they could never
put wrap their heads around what was going on I got there and I had I had that advantage uh I had
the advantage that I had concentrated on getting the theoretical the necessary theoretical background
so I I uh was able to interpret and explain a lot of what was going on in Russia in a way that
that other correspondents were not able to do simply because they hadn't had you know they
hadn't taken those steps what surprised you the most when you got there I mean obviously you had
learned a lot about the history and studied plenty about it and written about it but once you
actually like embedded there like what I mean it was always a yeah it's always a difference it's
always a difference it was still a shock you know to get there and you know see the long lines and
the drabness and the dreariness and also the sign you had everywhere signs uh you know no to the arms
race no to the cold war uh you know we're fighting for peace and yet everywhere you looked at you
could see signs of a country that was actually preparing for war and you know troops you know
in the back of trucks uh riding all through the streets of the capital at night these heavy weapons
under their tarpaulins that were you know being transported uh police everywhere uh buildings guarded
uh so that no uh no russian citizen could enter um there were a lot of things
and uh of course I I and also the strange crazy unanimity I remember one of our first trips
we made was to Uzbekistan and Tashkent the capital of Uzbekistan which in those days was a soviet
republic and uh the uh soviet propaganda was uh that the various peoples who comprised the soviet
union were uh dedicated to the concept of friendship of peoples in other words the reason them why they
were uh part of the soviet union was not because they had been corralled into this country by force
but because they had this deep friendship for each other that the soviet people loved each other
and that they so um we we had this press this press conference and the leaders of the Uzbek
republic were uh meeting with foreign correspondents I was one of those correspondents because we made
this trip to Uzbekistan and the one of the and with us of course were soviet correspondents who
were completely programmed so at the press conference one of the soviet correspondents says
uh addresses a question to the leaders of Uzbekistan and and the Uzbek soviet republic he says
what do you to what do you can attribute the success of the Uzbek soviet republic
and you had three government officials and all of them said with one voice just in chorus
friendship of peoples and it was you know there were scenes like that uh all the time I was
I was on a train and I was talking to there was a compartment and there were two people
soviet engineer and a woman who was I think she was she may also have been an engineer I don't know
anyway we were three through three random people sitting in a compartment but when they heard that
I was an american and a correspondent of course they became very interested and they said you know
in america everything is determined by money uh and I said well you know I don't know about that I
says you know we have we have elections we had a president and he was impeached and or nearly impeached
forced to resign and was talking about nixon at that time and this this uh soviet guy says well
that that's nothing I mean the elections are meaningless the real the real powers with the
money with the Rockefellers that's what he said yeah well that's what that's that's what he told me
and I so so uh he said you know you in america you you're you have formal democracy whereas here
in the soviet union what we have is genuine democracy so I said okay I mean so in other words
when you have elections with two candidates that's formal democracy but when there's only one
candidate that's genuine democracy and then they they smiled and looked at me and said as if I was
good this this kind of moronic uh kindergarten pupil who finally finally understood something
and I I began to think I was really living in a giant insane asylum you know so no so there were
many things you know the they they twisted people's minds in all kinds of ways in fact they're still
doing it in russia but uh but I had good preparation for that I had good theoretical preparation and
most of all I had the desire I had the desire to know to to understand I was curious a lot of the
other correspondence in Moscow in those days were absolutely miserable they didn't want to be there
they knew that for the purposes of their careers they had to spend a couple of years in dreary
uninteresting Moscow the place where there were no decent restaurants no decent stores nothing to do
and where their wives were slow slowly going crazy uh you know with boredom and uh and irritation
which they vented of course uh on their on their husbands and um but I didn't look at it that way
at all I mean and and most of them didn't speak russian they didn't make the effort uh but even
with my level of knowledge when I got there I realized that to really operate in the society I
would have to master the language and I met religiously with my russian teacher and it was
inconvenient it was easy to cancel those lessons but I understood that that this was the key I always
think that that could be one of the biggest barriers especially not I mean mainly within the media
because there's so it's like playing the game of telephone there's so many layers of people
that are digesting information repurposing it for headlines that most people don't
repass the headlines and then before all that you have the whole language barrier like how accurate
are the people that are interpreting what these russians are saying how accurate is the translation
before you get to all the media you know mint yeah I mean I'll give you a good example we had this
reset policy with president obama uh there was tension in relations between Russia and the
US and obama's view was that this was the fault of uh his predecessor george bush in fact obama
when he came into office was blaming everything and under the sun on george bush and uh and so
he announced a new policy and was called the policy of reset now boris nemtsov a russian
democratic leader who was murdered in february 2015 and i we met with we talked to a guy who i won't
name who was uh going to be obama's chief russian advisor and we told him and at that time there was
already talk about a so-called reset and we told him that that that you know putin is not a candidate
for partnership yeah he's a candidate for deterrence and of course he he he he didn't want to hear any
of it and then in his career was tied up with of course uh supporting whatever obama uh desired
but who is who is the who you're speaking about this is i i i do i since i know him personally
i prefer it's one of the top at the top one of the top advisors uh you know who who was behind the
reset policy okay and the reset policy was the idea that we were going to change you know re-examine
our positions and try to meet the russians halfway you know well uh uh you know basically we were
attributing an american psychology to the russians assuming that we will meet them halfway they'll
respond and and all the problems will be solved you know we just have to show a little goodwill
no understanding of who the russian leader was what the his background was what he had done what
what he was likely to do in the future and then to top everything off when they announced the reset
policy uh hillary clinton presented a red button to sergey lavrov who was the russian foreign
minister uh with the with the word reset in russian uh uh with a word uh for reset in russian
that was incorrect uh it was i mean in russian it was per gruska and it reset me is per zagruska
but you know for it's just the kind of unprofessional uh and this was presented by the
the secretary of state because hillary clinton was the secretary of state right to the russian
foreign minister uh and to show uh how you know how how sensitive we are to russian culture and of
course uh the the word that we chose was that you know for our policy was mistranslated and the the
the russian word that was you know on the gift on the red button was not the correct word do you
know what the actual word was like what it actually translated to in russian uh yeah i'm
per gruska it's reload but um she's not not not reset um it's just you know per zagruska is uh
uh it is resetting something the the uh whereas uh per gruska is is uh you know just plugging
something into a wall so that you know you know you'll get you'll you'll get the charge back
in any case i mean just typical but this is it goes to your point because
from the very top i mean how can we expect the media to be uh well informed how can we
expect the public discussion in the us to be well informed uh in a situation in which the
government is so unprofessional and uh let's face it to understanding russia is not simple
yeah i love it takes it takes work the famous mark twain quote uh if you don't read the newspaper
you're uninformed if you do read the newspaper you're misinformed yeah it shouldn't be that way
it shouldn't be that way uh but uh in fact uh you know just awful stuff i mean there was
recently a big article in the new york times a seven thousand word piece about explaining
vladimir putin and his rise to power not a single word about the apartment bombings which are the
real reason why he came to power why do you think that is i think that you know people uh
reject and are openly hostile to things they don't understand or that are really outside
their familiar outside their familiar uh kind of frame of reference and they even take you know
penetration serious analysis as a challenge and some in some cases even a personal challenge
uh and react with hostility to any attempt really to you know to look at a serious question
in a serious way can you take me through that story of the apartment bombings and how you
covered that story yeah okay well that's the most important i mean if you want to understand russia
then you have to understand the apartment bomb the story of the apartment bombings this is when
putin was well putin was at first the head of the fsb which is the successor organization to the kgb
but um during the 1990s when russia was transformed from a socialist country with us all property in
the hands of the state to a kind of capitalist society in which in under any circumstances
property was in private hands the um the consequences for the russian people were just horrific this is
when all the oligarchs took out like well they were created but but the the the and they were
created because the property of the soviet union the resource companies the the ports
the facilities they were all carved up among corrupt insiders who became oligarchs became known
as oligarchs they didn't create anything they were not true businessmen they were people who
benefited from the corruption in order to steal what it or what already existed but the consequences
of this this type of privatization were disastrous for the russian economy which collapsed i mean
the the the national incomes fell by by 50 percent well that didn't happen even under
nazi occupation and uh the the population for the most part with the exception of a very small group
was thrown into grinding poverty and it created a a profound psychological crisis which led to
among other things a very high death rate in the years 1990 of a 19 in the 1990s when russia's was
being transformed economically the uh the death rate in russia reached the level of uh
it reached unprecedented levels for an industrial country in fact during that period according to
demographers there were six million excess surplus deaths now surplus deaths or surplus
mortality is a term that's used by demographers uh to describe deaths that could not have been
anticipated on the basis of previously existing trends this is what demographers do they look
for example if they want they now it's 2022 they want to say you know what is the population going
to be in 2030 for example in a given country well they look at all of the relevant trends you know the
the the the way the economy is going the the climate the uh you know investment uh the you know
the health situation the improvement in medicine and so on and so forth it advances or or or or
problems in the area of child mortality and then they make on the on the basis of a of a
reasonable projection they say well the population is going to be x you know certainly well people
did that for russia of course during the 1990s and especially uh targeted the year 2000 which
was a logical target and the the difference between what they predicted and what uh what in
in in fact occurred was six million extra deaths uh suicide rate doubled accident rate went way up
people died in in unprecedented unprecedented numbers cardiological from our cardiovascular
disease cancer uh the murder rate uh you know became arguably the highest in the world uh all
of these things contributed and uh there was also just a profound psychological crisis for many people
who had who trained uh to believe in one system were thrown into another system uh for which they
were very poorly prepared in any case uh jeltsin was the president and his policies contributed
to this situation not only contributed to it they were they were instrumental and the result
was that his popularity in russia was practically zero public opinion polls showed that he had
two percent approval in the country when putin was promoted to the role of prime minister
from head of the fsb his popularity rating in the only poll that was taken before the bombings
was two percent it was generally considered to be uh out of the question that jeltsin or
anyone appointed by jeltsin could possibly succeed jeltsin as president and in 2000 he there were
new elections and the constitution said he could only serve two terms it was at that point
that the buildings in mosco began and in russia began to be blown up in the middle of the night
killing you know hundreds of people uh those bombings were attributed by the russian authorities
to the chechens who had after the a war in the early 1990s created a kind of independent state
which was not widely recognized but you know it had autonomy from russia and uh that was the basis
for launching a new war against chechnya and putin was put in charge of it suddenly putin this
completely uncharismatic person who no one had ever heard of in fact who had never had a career
as a public politician uh was everywhere vowing bloody revenge against the uh the terrorists
who had murdered innocent russian people in their beds and the the second chechen war
achieved early successes they were well prepared for it they used banned weapons uh cluster bombs
thermobaric weapons uh and they bomb markets as you know as they have a tendency to do
and they bomb civilian areas just as they're doing now in ukraine and uh the six the initial success
of the government uh under putin in pursuing that war uh raised putin's popularity and he overnight
became the leading com leading contender for the presidency and in fact was elected president
and his first official act was to pardon yeltsin and yeltsin's corrupt family for all crimes
committed while they were while they were in office so those bombings were very convenient
and there was a lot of circumstantial evidence that pointed to not chechens but the the the
russian intelligence services the real authors of those of those explosions
but what clinched the argument was a fifth bomb that didn't go off that was placed in the
basement of an apartment building in the city of rizan which is southeast of moscow what happened
was uh you know the whole country was was petrified uh with fear no one knew what apartment building
would be blown up next and at that moment uh this bomb was was placed in the basement of the building
in rizan but people were were on the lookout and and the the bombers were were were noticed
and the police were called and uh the perpetrators the people who had put the bomb in the the build
the bomb was defused the people who had put the bomb in the basement were caught and they turned
out to be fsb agents not chechens terrorists they produced fsb identification really yeah
and the bomb was a live bomb it was made uh out of the same material hexagon which is used to
top off artillery shells it's high explosive that was used in the the previous bombings and uh
uh they the the fsb hastily announced that this was uh not an attempt to blow up a building this
was a training exercise well you know believe that and i mean for one thing it couldn't have
been a training exercise because under the law if there's a training exercise all of the
officials in the locality where the exercise is being conducted have to be informed none of them
knew it was a training exercise uh the bombers used a stolen car well they wouldn't have needed a
stolen car uh if it had been a legitimate exercise and in fact uh the the bomb itself tested positive
for hexagon which is a very dangerous explosive and the detonator which was filmed in timestamped
uh was a live military detonator and you can't carry out an exercise with a live bomb
in a civilian apartment building so that was you know but and then people who began to investigate
they were all killed uh journalists um deputies in the parliament the state duma which is the
russian parliament and uh alexander litvinenko a former fsb agent who wrote about this was poisoned
with a radioactive isotope in london you may remember that case it was put in his tea and
then he just was kind of consumed from within by radiation uh so there's really no doubt
that that's how putin came to power what else did they have to gain by creating a new war
with chechnya besides gaining that political approval for him to gain power well that was the
that was the main thing that was primary it was to be young and uh and of course you know there was
a nationalist motive of course because the chechens had humiliated russia by defeating them in the
first chechen war and you know for given russia's national pride and and and so on i mean they may
they may have wanted to to blot out that disgrace as they understood it but the point is what it
really would did was it put it it um uh uh it elevated putin um
now who were you mentioned earlier there was a i think it was a journalist who you were friends
with who was murdered who was murdered outside the kremlin i believe well that's boris nemtsov
for he was but he was not a journalist but he was a leader of the leader of the democratic opposition
there he was a leader of the democratic democratic opposition in russia yeah um at what point did you
become close with him well i knew him over the years okay uh and you worked closely with him
no but i'm but we you know we we would we met and of course i was you know i i was familiar with
his work and uh and he was familiar with mine and you know we had good you know and friendly
relationship and uh you know like as in the case of other russians who were in the opposition
and with whom i had contact but he was very prominent i mean and he would you know i would
we would meet at conferences and uh and in russia itself now in your documentary age of delirium
there's so many fascinating stories that you covered in there from the train to the to the
buried printing press um and then when you combine all these different stories with the
apartment bombings it's easy to see how you you adopted this clear vision of what was going on
over there and how these people are living in there a completely different reality right can
you explain can you explain what what was the story uh and where were you at in your career in
moscow at the point when you were on the train and you got your briefcase stolen oh well that was
i had just arrived i had just arrived the film describes that that that incident
and i was making uh in those days i mean this was this is the 1970s i was 29 and
you know i was experienced by some standards but very inexperienced you know if you
kept in mind just the the complexity of the task that i that i had carved out for myself which
was to understand the soviet union in any case most of the correspondence in moscow did not travel
alone uh they consider it was considered dangerous mostly their trips were arranged by the soviet
authorities that they had and many of them didn't have the language uh i was beginning to get the
language but it was still a little bit wobbly um and i took that uh and i decided to visit the
baltic republics and to meet there with democratic dissidents and national nationalists in the baltic
republics and that was unusual for a western correspondent to travel alone uh and they uh
arranged for me to have as you know and they of course they controlled you know
where i would be sitting who would be in the compartment and they put two very good looking
girls and a another guy in the compartment with me and uh you know out of sheer inexperience i thought
i assumed that uh that was random i said well i suspected that it wasn't random but but it was
just so fantastic and i must say say the women were so attractive and they were well chosen
i'll tell you that that um and this was this is a long time ago uh and uh i just put aside my doubts
maybe because i wanted to who knows you know it was a very tempting situation but i was unmarried
and and uh young guy in in a strange country and uh the the the one of the girls went
got into a bunk with one of the the with the male guy with the who was and the other with
got into the upper bunk with me and weren't you guys like taking shots of cognac or something
oh yeah they've given us no we had tea they had tea and there was some there was some kind of sedative
in the tea that also you know relaxed whatever resistance i had which was not particularly great
anyway but the uh now is i think back on it um and this uh i mean this happened
in 1977 so a good uh a good long time ago a good you know now it's 45 years ago but but in any case
uh and then what you know while i was occupied with this woman uh the my briefcase was stolen
and my notes were taken and the the uh kgb got a hold of the addresses of the people that i was
supposed to see and they and i was met at the train station uh by the police i gave a statement and
then at at uh when i went to my hotel uh i was in count i was encountered by while i was standing
in line to register at the hotel uh someone came up to me and uh offered to shake hands and then
left a piece of paper in my hand and there was on the piece of paper a telephone number and a
message said call this number from an automatic telephone and i realized that this was either
the dissidents who were trying to get a hold of me or the kgb and i wasn't sure who it was
who now wanted to get a hold of me it was a situation was just something absolutely fantastic
for an americ young american in in the soviet union with no previous experience of the police
state atmosphere there you know to have i was without my suitcase without uh including uh you
know things i i i needed and and notes i had taken uh and so i i i i made the call from a
auto you know from a public telephone and i told myself that if the the voice that answered was
estonian if they spoke with an estonian accent i would assume it was the dissidents but if it was
if they spoke in you know a clear unaccented russian i would assume it was the kgb well they
the the voices uh were estonian and i um we ended up arranging a meeting and i spent three days with
people who convinced me that they were the estonian dissidents and uh uh it was only when i got back
to moscow that i got a message that the estonian dissidents had never met with me and i had spent
all this time not with the people i thought i was spending the time with but with kgb agents
who were impersonating dissidents yeah this is an experience but it taught me you know it
it taught me the fundamental lesson which is uh in the soviet union seeing is not necessarily
believing and uh that story which by the way is is included in my in my book never speak to strangers
which is a compil just recently released as a compilation of my articles over 40 years uh
you know i described this incident and uh that tells you everything you need to know about the
nature of the soviet union that you know that person stepping out of the shadows he can be anyone
wow and what was the story with the it was fascinating seeing that printing press that was
buried under a flower bed he had a there was this giant trough of flowers and then like a big water
pail that he had to like crank to move to the side under like a giant two-foot slab of concrete
and you guys climbed underneath this concrete slab and he had this massive printing press
how common was were things like that well this was what they had to do in this was in the baltic
republics uh the the example of that print underground printing press which was used i think to
is to print a publication called the chronicle of the lithuanian catholic church which was uh
an unofficial publication which contained a lot of information about nationalist activities in
lithuania uh that uh that was perhaps more elaborate than uh other methods that were used i mean in
moscow itself where you had a lot of people who sympathized with the democratic movement uh the
chronicle of current events which was a a also an unofficial publication but on the basis of the
entire country not just lithuania uh was was produced because there were hundreds of people
who would type up copies at home with uh with many with many uh what they would do is they would get a
single copy and then they would put in their typewriters five sheets and five sheets of carbon
paper and uh and retype and that was going on and that was the samis dot mis some is that is the
russian term for self-publishing some is self is that is published some is that means self-publishing
and the samis dot machine in moscow in st petersburg which are the big cities uh was uh involved
you know a lot of people certainly certainly scores probably hundreds
who would get uh copies of this forbidden literature forbidden unofficial literature
and they would you know retype it so each person could produce five copies and then those five
copies would be given to five people who would produce an additional five copies uh and and
you know it would it would multiply so uh but the but the printing press in in uh lithuania
that was featured in the film that was you know there are things like that also happened
there were also cases where people uh simply you know dug out of bunkers which you know which
were hidden from the authorities and uh piece by piece constructed uh uh you know underground
presses and and produced material which was then circulated now what what was the catalyst what was
the straw that broke the camel's back for you in as far as your reporting and you not being welcomed
back into russia i mean why was why was it that i was expelled in 2013 yeah obviously you had been
your reporting was not favored right by the russian authorities for your entire stay in russia
for the entire time you were reporting from moscow right i mean you know i assume that your work was
not pro russian with not like a pro russian view well was it was i i i felt that it was neither
pro russian or anti russian that it was an attempt just to show things as they as they were
what was there was there one specific story that well i think that my writing about the apartment
bombings pushed their the limits of their tolerance but i also was in a kind of situation
you have to understand that the soviet union and russia are very unusual countries in that
they are uh dictatorships and they are repressive but they try to give the impression that they are
democratic and in order to create that illusion which they then are very adept at manipulating
to their own advantage they're ready to tolerate a certain amount of freedom and i pushed that
freedom to the outer limit for they didn't want to expel me uh earlier because that would have
been acknowledging the truth of what i was writing they wanted to take the view that and and they
wanted to convince others that you know i was just spouting some kind of conspiracy theory and of
course that didn't bother them you know was just irresponsible and uh but the situation
changed in 2013 because the whole situation in russia changed as a result of the uh euro maydan
right the maydan massacre no well the maydan first of all the protests right the the massacre the
sniper massacre came later okay that was it yeah the sniper massacre was towards the end right
that was in february of 2014 but the euro maydan was uh the scene of massive popular demonstrations
against victor janakovich who was then the president of ukraine and who was you know comparatively
pro-russian in any case that rattled the the russian authorities because that income first of all
in 2011 there had been protests in russia over falsified power parliamentary elections
those those those protests fizzled out but a the protest movement in the former soviet union
you know reappeared in effect in ukraine and it was ultimately successful but the mere thought
of 300 000 people on the street demanding an end to the government of a kleptocratic ruler
that was enough to unsettle the russian authorities and to and to to make them reevaluate
that that area of tolerance that they had that that they had previously extended to liberals
foreigners and it turns out i was in russia there's an expression pervet elastica means the first
swallow the first sign of something i was in my expulsion was in in effect the the first swallow
of the wave of repression that would uh engulf russia because i although i was my they the one of
the first things they did was to expel me maybe the first thing then there were other repressive
measures and a lot of other things happened i mean in the end boris nemtsov for example was
murdered a lot of other people were expelled there were uh uh not journalists but but there was a
tightening of repression across the board but the first sign of this was my expulsion and i think it
was connected with the idea that uh you know under conditions in which people have shown their
ability to take to the streets even if they did it in a neighboring country uh russia could not
afford the level of tolerance and liberalism that it had been demonstrating don't you think it was
crazy how uh the american american politicians such as john mccain would go there and and and be a
part of rallies pro pro pro tech like uh with the opposition and like rallying them and showing
support with them and seems to just be deepening the divide and the chaos there are we talking
about ukraine oh yeah i'm talking about maydan um the protet when you were talking about the people
on the streets in maydan uh during that thing before the massacre that these us diplomats were
showing up on the streets and rallying with these people and not they were deepening the chaos they
were pouring gas on this thing and they weren't trying to i mean could you imagine that happening
when in the us could you imagine a protest like this happening in washington and diplomats from
other countries coming here and handing out water bottles or or supporting these protests like you
would never see something like that happen it just seems so crazy well actually during the soviet
period they there were there were uh such such things um but but but i don't think that the
appearance of i mean if we talk about maydan for now for the moment i don't think that the appearance
of john mccain or any other american official was particularly important uh to what happened
in ukraine except you know that there's some politics foreign politicians are showing up and
saying we support you but and those politicians are not well informed uh they don't say anything
you know very intelligent when they get up on the stage there were uh in the maydan all
kinds of people were showing up russian dissidents uh various artistic people people from all over
the world coming in to express their support for the protest uh but uh the they their role i mean
was not uh was not decisive um what determined the the the the course of events uh were
forces within ukrainian society itself uh and you're talking about like the the nazi militias
the the far-right groups that were inciting the violence the well you had you had you have to
understand what you had here you had uh a leader uh victor janakovic who was massive massively
corrupt and and had established a very corrupt system uh you had a country with lots of problems
which was nonetheless uh hoping and many people were hoping to move toward the west
and which did not want russian and russian domination they wanted independence there were
pro-russian elements in the country no question about it and particularly in east ukraine but
overall the sentiment was for an independent country we know this because in 1991 when the
soviet union broke up uh ukraine the ukrainian population voted by over 90 for independence
and that included even the russian speaking areas like Crimea and east ukraine so although
there was you know there was pro-russian sentiment in some places there were some issues uh over
language uh there were some ethnic tensions but on the whole the the the sentiment in the country
was in favor of independence on the one hand and affiliation with the west and affiliation with
the west was seen by many ukrainians in a very unrealistic way uh they they attached to uh you
know it was one of those situations and where you attribute to someone uh that you don't know very
well uh all of your hopes so uh the the idea of becoming part of the european union for many
people in ukraine symbolized well prosperity a better life of freedom from corruption an end to
kind of criminal coercion which was very very prevalent under Yanukovych and when uh Yanukovych
and Yanukovych had encouraged this to some extent because he was negotiating with the european union
about the possibility of becoming part of the european union and when he announced uh abruptly
that there was that the talks were were suspended or that they were they were cancelled and there
was no indication that they were going to be re uh restarted that that for many people uh
was a blow to the hopes of a better future because they had pinned they had pinned a lot on the
you're on this idea of moving toward the west but they pinned too much in fact on it it was unrealistic
because the you know the process of becoming part of the european union would have been long and
drawn out and it and ukraine because of you know many characteristics inherited from the soviet
union would have had to make big changes that they were not adapted to make but but nonetheless uh
you know this was this was this was a blow and then of course the the attack on the students
who were who were uh you know in the center were at at my don at the christmas tree right yeah the
christmas tree thing was crazy right yeah that well that sparked the crowd that gave people you
know the the incentive to come out and protest but they weren't so much protesting the beatings
although that was part of it i mean as protesting the fact that the government was behaving in a
high-handed way and people assumed that this was that janikovic was going to be president for life
and this was and he was he was extinguishing any hope for a kind of democratic future for the country
and that's what brought hundreds of thousands of people out into the street and into my don
to protest and it was all peaceful until that night the christmas tree came out and and i believe
it was that was that that was the uh the incident that sparked right the i mean before that there
were period there were demonstrations they came and went but um you didn't have the kind of massive
demonstrations that that that took place after that attack on the students now ukraine has is
a true ukraine has always been this rope that's in the middle of a tug of war between the us and
russia right the ukraine's always been kind of in the middle between this constant tug of war no
no i don't think so i mean the the uh no there's a there there are differences within ukraine itself
but in fact listen in 1997 russia and ukraine signed a treat a treaty of friendship in uh
2010
there was an agreement well first of all there was an agreement between russia and ukraine
which allowed about dividing the black sea fleet just the molotov no no no no that's some that's
something different okay there's one of the one of the soviet navy was divided into fleets there
was a pacific fleet the northern fleet the black sea fleet well you know with the breakup of the
soviet union the black sea fleet which docked at sevastopol which is in ukraine had you know had
to be divided between ukraine and crimea was ukrainian territory and and russia and an agreement
was reached on that uh you know how the ships and and the facilities were to be divided and
russia agreed to lease the port of sevastopol on ukraine and territory into base troops there
with ukraine's agreement and that that agreement was renewed in 2010 okay uh and in 2017 it was
again renewed up until 2042 and in 2017 the agreement was if i recall correctly
that in return for the use of the port facilities a russia would give ukraine a discount on gas
which is probably ukraine of course all these agreements became dead letters when russia just
decided to seize crime me yeah right and because they'd seized after maydan right that was right
that was almost like two months after the yeah well it was after yeah it was after after maydan
right it was after maydan but so so the the president um what was the name of the president
porche uh poroshenko during the maydan uh riots but he was not president at that time who was the
at the time of of the maydan victor yana kovic was still the president and he was uh more of the
russian backed president the the let's go back real quick the orange revolution yeah well that was
2004 that was 2004 yeah and what was the what was the reason for the orange revolution again
the the election of a falsification of the election results between between yana kovic and
victor yushenko yushenko okay and yushenko was the guy who was backed by the us and yana
kovic was the guy who was backed by russia well it's hard to say i mean i think that uh i think he
had a didn't didn't uh i'm forgetting his name again the other guy the guy who was i just said
was backed by the us victor yushenko yushenko his wife worked in i know his wife i mean his wife
is from chicago just as i am wow i mean she's for the ukrainian community in in chicago i
i knew her actually before she married him and didn't didn't she work in politics in the us
a little bit she were she worked um she worked in she had a job in the state department but i that
was not uh i wouldn't attach you know too much importance to that the real conflict in uh 2004
was over the integrity of the election result because who was the guy's name the one well
yushenko won first of all the they they he won because protests forced a new election right
he didn't officially win though the first no the first the first in the first round
or the the originally yana kovic won right but there were signs of massive voter fraud
that led to the protests that were known as the orange revolution
uh the the candidate who lost was victor yushenko and the the crisis was diffused finally
with agreement to have an a new election under tight control which took place and reversed
the the result of the first election instead of yana kovic winning it was yushenko who won
the position of the us at that time was that we are in favor of of of honest elections
not so much well isn't it also convenient for the us and if you look at the history of the cia
that there was a massive revolution there uh on the claims of election fraud that the russian
backed president the russian backed president actually won and now there's fraud and now we're
going to have this orange revolution and the us backed president is going to be put in uh i you
know i wouldn't uh i wouldn't overestimate this is what we always do in the us uh we overestimate
our own importance uh in the situation uh the thing is that uh yushenko was backed by the western
ukrainians uh and a yana kovic by the eastern ukrainians uh and the the i mean in effect yana
kovic accepted the result and he then with the help of us advisors by the way including paul maniford
uh prepared to run again and this time he did win he was elected so because uh largely out of
disappointment with yushenko on the part of ukrainians and his you know certain unfulfilled
promises which maybe you know given the nature of ukrainian politics maybe he would have had he
was well intentioned but maybe he had a a uh he also got poisoned right yushenko well that came
yeah that that that uh that as well but uh after the after the first round when they prepared for
the second round uh you know the set you know the the uh he was poisoned he was poisoned and his
face was was disfigured and uh but he won but he won the the election and and uh yana kovic
accepted that result and he was advised including by the us by us people like paul maniford just to
prepare for the next election which he did and he won that one right how now how is that first
election how did they redo that did they redo the votes no they just uh they just announced new a
new election they would just they said a whole new yeah do it all over again yeah okay yeah and to
see i mean and it would have been paul you know had there not been all this vote fraud
those the new election might have come up with a result very much like the first one but the
difference but you know this the second election was held under under tighter control
and uh it it showed that that the winner was yushenko which is what people were saying all
along that that he had won the first time too right and and i that result suggests to me that
that was right that that it was machinations and voter vote fraud that made it possible for yana
kovic to win the first time now when he came back in 2008 he won right and there was no voter
fraud well if there was both sides i mean there there may have been to some extent who knows
but both sides accepted the result now during uh the maydan revolution who is more to benefit
from that the us or russia the us doesn't really benefit uh did they benefit in any way from that
because if you look at all the the the us the us uh benefits in an abstract way
uh if um
if a country is i mean able to have democratic elections and if those elections bring to power
people who are favorable to the us you know that is you know we we we we of course prefer to see
people who who are friendly to the us in power in those places but it's not such a big deal but i
mean we we we we deal with all kinds of people we dealt with yana kovic and not not when he when
you know during the period that he was president and not only that but when when he ran again
for president in 2008 he had american advisors so i wouldn't you know this is the big mistake
that we americans always make we always think that you know that um america determines everything we
determine a lot we don't determine everything a lot it depends on on uh you know factors within the
country that's concerned whether that country is ukraine or some other country it seems like we have
so much we've always since forever we've had so much interest in the ukraine i mean and especially
if you know you watch the documentary ukraine on fire when you when you see the recorded phone
call between victoria newland and gregory piet and she's they're basically discussing who should be
the next leader of the ukraine it seems like they're discussing a coup um you know it's kind of dark
i i what did you take on that what what did you think i i did look at it i looked at the at the
documentary um you know it and and my impression in general of of oliver stone is that he's um
he has very superficial knowledge and he doesn't understand what the events mean
he doesn't have the critical thing that you need if you're going to write about a foreign country
which is context you have to understand the psychology the political situation um you can get
or you can get an outrageous quote from from some stupid american official who doesn't know
anything anyway uh that doesn't mean that they can really control events they may wish they could uh the
there's a lot to say about the maydan uh revolt and i i i also saw uh
the the
stones um description of ukrainian history a lot of that film begins with a long
right a discussion of ukrainian history which he clearly doesn't understand and you know he's
he's piecing things together he he uh he has certain preoccupations about the u.s. and of
course he then applies that to foreign countries that he doesn't know very well he doesn't understand
uh you know it was such a mess um that you know we could look at it and we could try to correct
some that i could show you but uh the the the the maydan revolt
was the expression of
you know the kind of the middle class the democratically oriented people in russia
in ukraine to move the country toward a better future uh that was it was taken advantage of
by some unsavory people and there were unsavory elements that that participated particularly
in the end and the last stages but the idea that it was a high priority for the us i mean we worked
we worked with yana kovic i mean the the the us was not desperate and has never been desperate to
to make ukraine a member of nato which would have protected ukraine so uh you know the the uh
you know films about about maydan and and about the events are fine they should be
they should be done by people who are really qualified to do them and uh i would not put
oliver stone in that category who was steppant can you explain who steppan bandera was and why
was he protected by the cia along with you mean after the war after the war yeah well steppa
steppan bandera was the head of the ukrainian nationalists he was a theoretician of the uh
not so much a fighter but as a theoretician of ukraine he was worshiped in in ukraine there
were statues of him right there were a lot of people you know this is this happens all throughout
eastern europe not just in ukraine it's also in the baltic republics and elsewhere various
nationalist figures who who during the war uh either allied with the nazis or uh
you know sympathized with um you see this in in in the the
in hungary and the baltics and and elsewhere um they is it is it true that the ukrainian
nationalists they switched sides multiple times during the war during world war two well they
were they they understood during i mean the the bandera nationalists uh actually fought against
of his fought against the nazi i mean their goal was not not they did not support nazi ideology
they supported an independent ukraine and if the nazis could help them achieve that
so they thought uh they could work with them but the the nazis never trusted them they understood
that their goal was an independent ukraine and when it became clear that the nazis had no interest
in the independent ukraine the bandera forces began to you know fought both sides and you know
both sides were pretty bad in reality but the bandera uh you know the ukrainian nationalists
were also very bad uh and and they carried out horrific massacres whether you know to what extent
you know the under wartime conditions and this is always this this this goes back to the to the the
um creation of an independent ukrainian republic after the after the collapse of the russian empire
to what extent the the nationalist leaders were directly implicated in the massacres to what
extent uh this is all uh complex history that has to be you know that has to be examined
dispassionately i personally think that the you know uh uh
the maydan movement as it was made a made a big mistake or rather let's put it another way that
the the ukrainian national the extreme ukrainian right wing the including those including supporters
of bandera you know discredited to up to a point the the the maydan uh the maydan revolt which was
basically middle class and democratic in or emperor western and these guys showed up everywhere
right you know with their flags and emblems right and and were calling attention to themselves
when it comes to a regular election in ukraine they have very little support okay but but but
in terms of calling it you know staging provocations in terms of calling attention to themselves
and in terms of their readiness to use violence they were you know they were prominent and of
course the russians focused on them ignoring the broader issue which is that uh ukraine was
interested in becoming part of the west right there's a lot i mean there's a there was cia
documents that were released that proved that the cia was working with those militias those
those neo-nazi militias as counter to service counterintelligence for the us i mean during the
soviet times yes exactly yeah we during the you know once the cold war began
uh you know these people had you know networks of contacts inside the soviet union soviet union
was ruled by Stalin it was a complete a terroristic and closed country uh the ukrainian nationalists
were fighting a a guerrilla war uh and against against the Stalin against the you know the
the soviet union they had contacts that were valuable to the cia uh we used uh we used the
contacts of ex-nazi we used ex-nazis and their information about the soviet union
the thing is when you're the a lot of people it's this is the problem when people who don't know
the world of intelligence begin making documentaries and offering their opinion uh on one level they're
correct uh but fundamentally they're wrong because they don't understand the overall picture in which
these things happen and what you know the us was trying to basically to support democracy
and but and to and to make sure that Stalin didn't do something like what Putin just did
because you know the the power of the soviet union was incomparably greater than the power
of today's russia i mean that was it was the foremost military power right and uh
uh so you know in you know that meant that we you know that
William Casey who was president reagan's head of the cia made an interesting remark that i think
really kind of sums it up and he said that um you know the the fact is i cannot guarantee or
protect the the safety of the american people if i'm only allowed uh i'm i can't i can't i can't
i cannot uh protect the security of americans if i'm only allowed to work with nice people
right um intelligent you know in the world of intelligence i mean for those who don't understand
this is one of the reasons why i was never suspected by the russians of being an intelligence
agent although they put out that you know they they were happy to put put that out
because uh you know intelligence agents are trying to find people to betray their government
and provide you know critical information i mean it's an ugly process but unfortunately it can
save it can save lives it can it can prevent war it can you know prevent surprises and intelligence
agents aren't or especially covert intelligence agents aren't trying to be uh they're not publishing
stories trying to get attention on themselves they're trying to stay under the radar well they
i hope so but the thing is that um the uh
the reality is that during the cold war you know faced with you know a country like like
soviet union which had millions of people in slave labor camps that was carrying out you know mass
executions and and you know we had to we we dealt yeah we dealt with very unsavory people no
question about it but we did so in order to protect you know the democratic liberties of the
of of americans and also to resist a totalitarian power which was very dangerous
now you could say well look you know why don't you restrict you know you can you're you're allowed
to work to work with the peace movement the greens uh with feminists uh gay rights groups but uh you
know anybody else you you you better stay away from okay but i mean those groups aren't going to
they don't have the intelligence that we need right no i understand what you're saying i understand
i mean it's it's a i mean it's yeah you can accuse people and you're and you're kind of right but
you know in in in normal society you wouldn't want to have have have an ally like the former
head of the german obvair who was in german but on the other hand he had priceless intelligence
uh you know and these are these are not simple decisions and i think that people in the world
of intelligence they even agonize over some of them because but so do you think the do you think
the u.s and the cia had no involvement in provocating any of the violence in the maidan events in 2014
the massacre and the shootings the snipers killing cops and killing killing protesters
the the i don't i mean i don't have you know exhaustive knowledge of everything that happened
but the um i think it's an over exaggeration i i mean i would not i don't i don't think the u.s
would be uh involved in that but but the the right wing extremist groups definitely could be
and were could be and were probably why would they kill cops and protesters create chaos
and uh for what though well this is a tactic of the kgb you know it's called um but it's called
piccadilly uh after the street in london you know busy street piccadilly you you start shooting
everybody your your allies and your and your and your opponents in order to create total confusion
and then the best organized group wins but why would russia want to problem why would
russia want to stir this thing up even more i'm not sure that russia was necessarily involved
in those events but the um russia had nothing had everything to loot they wanted um the current
president of the ukraine they didn't want him to be kicked out right yeah uh and he and he
sought sought sought refuge in in russia in russia as did other and then his motorcade as
soon as he took off in the helicopter his motorcade got shot at or shot up and i think that some of
those the drivers of his motorcade got shot entirely possible but the thing is that um
um the the my don the sniper massacre uh it you know it it looks like that was planned by right wing
you know extremists as a way of getting getting but the overall i mean but the the hundreds of
thousands of people who were in the square they knew nothing about but weren't the right wing
extremists pro-west you know they're not really uh they are they're anti-russian right they want to
be there and they're most that they're mostly anti-russian and ukrainian nationalist and and a
lot of the things they do and say are unacceptable in the west and by the way they're unacceptable
in ukraine as well they get you know the right wing right wing groups get you know in in free
elections they get what two percent i don't know they probably get less than they do in
some western european countries what is the story of i mean okay so the the narrative that most people
in the u.s. have digested as far as part as or as far as crimea goes is that russia basically
invaded in force forces hand and took over crimea with force what is what actually happened in crimea
well that they took took it over by force but the but um
the they concealed you know the there you see that they were already there were already russian
bases there by agreement right so it was not a russian soldiers were always there right yeah
and and there was an agreement on that with ukraine and so it was not a difficult thing for them to
you know you know especially in 2014 ukraine was not prepared for a military confrontation
with russia there were only about six thousand battle ready troops in the entire ukrainian army
they really had no possibility to contest the takeover of crimea it would have just been suicide i
mean they could have contested it and they decided not to a given the conditions of chaos yeah which
is hence why nobody died no one died because the ukrainians didn't resist and it was carried out it
was carried out with lightning speed and it was well planned so basically what happened was the
russians came in they took over the they basically held the part the building whatever the building
was where um the votes were held and the vote came out as 90% voted well and you know the
yeah here's the thing under the conditions of the maidan revolt uh you know the the people in
Crimea were Yanukovych voters by and large okay and they're ethnic russians so so the you know the
turmoil in Kiev could you know definitely affected you know the mood in Crimea but and and also you
know once the russians had occupied the place and announced that they were there was going to be a
referendum well how can you have a referendum when somebody has annexed a territory and announced
a vote uh under conditions that they control but uh even if in fact there was majority sentiment
in Crimea for example uh becoming part of Russia right that's not the way we change
change borders right obviously we don't because there there could be a majority sentiment in
Texas for for becoming part of Mexico and we wouldn't we wouldn't we wouldn't go along with that either
right the the the point of of world peace is and this has been a fundamental principle since the
Second World War is uh the respect for international borders and they can be changed but just not by
force the border for example Slovakia separated and became an independent state
it was part of the country called Czechoslovakia
and that was done peacefully by agreement uh and you know the terms were worked out you know how
how it would be you know there was a a referendum in Scotland about secession from the United Kingdom
so these things can be I mean there but that that type of thing is not excluded I mean you know
borders that that are changed peacefully uh are consistent with the post uh World War II consensus
well Crimea couldn't you say that Crimea was it was somewhat peaceful right I mean no one got killed
the vote was 90 percent to be go back into Russia they 90 percent of them voted to be
come apart of Russia and wasn't before that I'm just being the devil's advocate but before that
I don't know how long it was but didn't Russia basically just give Crimea to Ukraine it was
Nikita Khrushchev who uh uh get you know made Crimea part of of um
and that was back in the 50s uh part of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic
and when the Soviet Union broke up
the Ukrainian Republic included Crimea which by the way voted for independence for Ukraine
in 90 91 okay as did Eastern Ukraine and uh
this is the you know the when any colonial empire same as Africa or Yugoslavia any place
when it breaks up uh people they you know there are lots of anomalies even injustices you know
people you know who who belong to one ethnic group find themselves living on the territory
of a state that right you know is dominated by a different ethnic group but uh to read you know
but those borders are are left intact because you know otherwise you're gonna just what get
what we have just a constant war um and and you know as the Russians say there's a proverb
bad peace is better than a good war uh it's it's so wild just that part of the world the people
in that part of the world i someone like myself and most people in the u.s that are my age could
never fucking imagine the blood-soaked history that's just ingrained that must be ingrained
and hardwired into the DNA of the people over there well and that's a good thing that you say that
and that's important for for people of your generation people in the united states in general
to keep in mind there's a reason for the you know we don't have that kind of bloody history
we don't have you know in our families you know people who were taken out and shot
or who came back after 20 years in a in a Siberian labor camp and the reason is because of
the democratic liberties that we have here and those are things that we have to try the
reason why we have so much turmoil in the u.s now is because people are so fixated on themselves
they don't understand you know what has been achieved in the united states the model of
peacefulness and democratic process with all its faults that protects us from the kind of
things that happen in other countries it's almost like things are too good here well that's life
is just too easy we're just looking for problems we we we're looking we look for problems and we
look for and because americans uh and it's a it's uh it's it's an irony uh they they're looking for
meaning and they're looking in the wrong places uh they want to give meaning to their lives
so they become extremists concerning diversity climate change gender equality transgender
rights or whatever it happens to be uh and not that those things are necessarily bad or you know
but they're trivial and and they they don't they don't yeah they don't they don't touch on the real
issues which are you know the the the the need for the united states to and for the other democratic
countries the world countries like great britain france and other places to kind of preserve
a space in the world in which people can lead civilized lives and not live in fear
um yeah it's it's so troubling to see you know some of the history of this part of the world
and watch some of like some of the documentaries i've been watching the last couple weeks
and then you see actors go on twitter and try to call you know some governor of a state in the
u.s a nazi oh of course this is this is all they're trying to redefine nazis in the u.s because we
need we need that enemy well we need we need to call people something yeah and we don't know what
the need what the real term refers to it it's it's um it's unfortunate i mean and it's your
generation that's that that's being affected very much now by this uh and why i mean i'm involved in
a couple a couple things uh try to raise the level of education so that that that we do have some
awareness you know i for example i grew up with the cold war i grew up with the legacy of the
second world war the aftermath of nazism when i was you know when i was in my 20s people in their
20s and 30s now you know not to mention teenagers i mean they don't have that experience and and
what they never experienced they have trouble imagining that's for sure yeah um in fact that's
partially what i try to do is is with my writing with the film the other things is to just
provide those materials for those for those who are ready to benefit from it you know
this all kind of goes back to you know one of the issues that i noticed with the us and our
involvement internationally geopolitically is that we spend so much money on these things
like how much money how many billions of dollars have we poured into the ukraine but how much money
do we spend on educating our own people here it's it's well you know it's not a question of money
even uh it's not as if spending more money would make us better educated might make us
worse educated the it's really a question of intellectual self-discipline and commitment
you know genuine objectivity and honesty and presenting information those things i mean our
universities for example uh you know it it it's a it is it's unbelievable how much it costs
to send a student to a four-year college in the us but has the the level of education improved i don't
think so yeah but even in even in our younger ages like in in middle school high school even
preschool those levels i mean the teachers came and afford to buy supplies for those classrooms
for their kids and you know how are you going to how are you going you need to focus on that more
don't you don't don't you think we should be focusing whether you say money is the answer or
not like if you actually we should be focusing on improving the quality of our education and making
sure that we have kind of the objective standards and that we that we that we are tough and rigorous
and we produce we develop the talent of our people yeah and it's it i mean it all kind
of ties back to i mean right now obviously you're aware and many people my age you're aware that if
you really want to learn something you can do it you can go on the internet and we have
we have free internet you can go on there you can find anything you want for by and large most
things aren't censored which is what i talked to you about the other day when we spoke i said the
reason a lot of people are watching this oliver stone ukraine documentary is because youtube
censored it youtube took it off their platform right now all of a sudden it's it's in the spotlight
why did youtube do this right um and it's opening up a lot of people's eyes and a lot of people
are being exposed to films like this that are being censored and you know it makes me wonder
where are we going why does the u.s government want to censor this well we've got a lot of i mean
i don't know if it's the government that's doing the government the government works with these
companies like youtube google i mean we had that we had this you know it's a big issue in the u.s
was the the censoring of the information about the hunter biden laptop right uh
this this was you know the the this was
an explosive uh charge which is well documented
on the eve of the election and the tech companies all of them blocked the distribution
right including from the new york post's own website
wow i mean now that's but that wasn't done by the government that was done by the tech companies
on behalf of one political party or political or one candidate or one uh ideology one not ideology
but one one uh hate for one one political orientation i would say uh i mean the the the
the idea that the tech companies uh you know and then there was this this crazy crazy thing where
the uh a whole group of former intelligence officials said that information about the
laptop was russian disinformation when there was no evidence at all of that
the same people who when they were confronted with russian disinformation in the steel dossier
didn't recognize it uh you know obviously uh this this creates a real problem but this is
but i think we have to be clear here these are private companies that are doing this
and it there's a case for for for taking that power out of their hands
but uh that doesn't mean that it's the government that's doing it i'm unaware for example that the
oliver stone uh document that the action of youtube against the oliver stone documentary
had anything to do with the government youtube and google they they they they uh they're capable
of acting on their own and these are oftentimes the people who are the least qualified to make
these judgments you know the social media has changed the landscape tremendously i mean that
active censorship i mean some people say it changed the outcome of the election who knows would it would
would a vigorous press uh and an absence of so censorship in the social media have created
a situation in which uh biden was seen as too corrupted uh at least by association
to be elected president well we'll never know the answer to that question there was the difference
in votes was only for it was 47 000 votes had changed that had changed uh uh preferences or
voters had had voted instead for trump he would have won so do you do you think that russia does
medal in our elections yeah up to a point but the the but it's it doesn't amount to a whole
whole lot i mean they they are just mostly because they are very you know they're looking for things
to do and we do the same thing in other countries oh well we've been very we were very active in the
90 well american citizens in their private capacity played a huge role in the russian 1996
election presidential election how do we mean citizens well consultants private consultants
but with you know great government connections who and and also we i mean that's a whole separate
story but the the american you know the agency for international development we gave aid
you know we we handed out aid to to political factions that we wanted to succeed in russia
is this the hillary clinton thing the hillary clinton no no this is something different i mean
this is civil societies yeah no this was this was uh you know we we were very pro-yeltsin
and we were very concerned that the communists would win in 1996 and we we did everything we
could to foster democracy as we saw it in in russia but in it was and you know we instructed
people how to organize votes how to canvas how to you know create political ads but all of our
good advice went only to one side uh the communists and the leftists who were more anti-us more
anti-western they uh they were offered the opportunity uh to get this information they
didn't react and there was no attempt made to return their calls or you know we we reacted with
relief our people reacted with relief that that they uh didn't want our advice so we were free to
to kind of give uh right you know useful advice to the other side but the point the point here is
that the in the in the case of the russian collusion in the trump clinton election which is
what a lot of the discussion is about it was not so much that they were interfering although
they probably did interfere to some extent it appears that they did they did they did some
hacking i wasn't myself a victim of their hacking really it was written about yeah uh they got into
my email but but uh that we can come to that in a minute um but the real the real damage
that the russians did was uh by providing the disinformation that went into the steel dossier
and that was only possible because basically americans in this case the clinton campaign
were asking and hungry for that disinformation and they and wanted and and were indifferent to the
to the to its provenance that's why that happened not so much that the russians took the initiative
but they reacted to people who who wanted to screw their opponents and weren't particularly
concerned about the effect it would have on the country as a whole well originally this
originally the story was that it was russia meddling with the election then it changed and
then the focus went to ukraine and then and then all the investigations were going to okay
you know ukraine is meddling with this election this this was the 2016 trump hillary election
and it was poroshenko who seemed to be very pro clinton and anti trump during that election
i think this is partially because the the the the democrats were putting out the idea that uh
that the russians were pro trump so the ukrainians reacted by being pro clinton i think there was a
lot of confusion on the part of the ukrainians as to what was really going on as the
um
they may have fallen victims of
of russia's propaganda and and the democratic party's propaganda because they may have over
estimated the extent to which trump would be uh you know a tool in the hands of the russians i
mean it was trump that authorized the javelin missiles not obama right you know there when it
comes to trump the hysteria becomes such that any kind of objective discussion and he stokes it
he contributes to it but but you know there's we have a situation in this country in which
uh
the his the level of hysteria is such that looking at trump and what he did do and did not do and
evaluating it objectively is just uh not possible for people right one of the one of the main
ideas that uh oliver son pushes in the ukrain documentary um i think it was the second one he
had there was two there was uh there was ukrain on fire which was the first one that goes up to
which basically covers maydan um and then there was the second one which goes all the way up to
current events um with the election of the current guy um you mean zelenski zelenski yeah he talks
about zelenski that's where that's where the second documentary ends but he he covers the uh
the 2016 us election uh pretty he was pretty deep on it um basically going back to the idea of how
ukraine um had a big part to do with this 2016 election and all the people involved specifically
he talks about hillary clinton's uh civil society's 2.0 program that she created a secretary of
state under obama um and the program was to train and fund ngo's overseas yeah um one of the ngo's
that she worked with directly was called the international renaissance foundation which was
funded by george soros uh so it was not funded by the u.s government no this this specific uh
international renaissance foundation was funded by george soros and the u.s government provided
the training so we worked with them we worked with them right to provide the training um not
specifically the funding for that one um but this was part of the private email network she set up
was part of the civil society's 2.0 program which is crazy something like this exists um
and then when you go to you know what we talked already poroshenko was very pro-clin anti-trump
the investigations into ukraine meddling broke out paul manifort was proven to be working directly
with the ukrainian party the party of regions mm-hmm well that's maniforts uh that's yeah
janakovic's party janakovic's party right yeah um and sergio leshenko was the journalist
yeah sergio leshenko sergio leshenko he was the journalist who basically
revealed the receipts from the paul manifort receipts on this black ledger
right um what was your view of all of this when it was going down
well the black the the controversy about the black ledger i'm familiar with that and and um
i don't think that any of this stuff had much impact on the u.s uh election
the uh you know knowing the region a little bit as i do i my guess is that
the ukrainians were influenced and this this is conjecture on my part so you'll take it for just
an educated guess okay uh were influenced by the charges against trump that in insofar as
trump was being accused of being a russian agent uh they they took it upon themselves to do what
they could to help uh hillary who was his political opponent and in particular people who had been
uh part of that ngo world in ukraine uh you know may may or may not have taken the initiative to
provide dubious information uh to undercut for example paul manifort i mean manifort was
an advisor to janikovic now he ends up uh advising trump so that fit in with the kind of narrative
that was created that trump was uh somehow under the control of the russians the reality being
however it was the manifort uh uh was you know and a political advisor to all kinds of people
not just janikovic and that trump uh presumably hired him not because of his connections to russia
but because of his skill in winning elections which which he had demonstrated so i don't i think
that this is just the kind of you know as the layers of intrigue and deception began to build
upon each other uh everybody god didn't want it to get into the act uh that's now the the black ledger
as i understand is false but yeah once again i have not uh i've not uh investigated that in any
depth i mean there there are certain things i have investigated in depth that's not one of them
in the documentary uh they talk when they talk about the black ledger um it had names of hundreds
of people's signatures on there with receipts who were paid in total you know hundreds of millions
of dollars uh one of the names on that black ledger was manifort yeah um and then initially so
so the guy uh leshenko the journalist slasher gay let's show sir gay leshenko the journalist slash
activist against against all corruption he was eventually convicted for meddling in the election
and working with alexandra alexandra chalupa who spearheaded this anti-trump campaign and she was
that many people came out said that she was like trying to find dirt on trump to try to
well a lot of people were yeah and uh uh and by the way people would have been glad to get
dirt on hillary uh it surprises me a little bit of how ineffectual they were because uh
that uh that information exists but um but you know the the the the key thing to bear in mind here
is that when russia or russian intelligence sees an opportunity to disrupt american society they
will take it but that the opportunity is provided by americans our you know this is our political
divide the political hatreds in this country give give uh foreigners a golden opportunity
to weaken the country uh as long as we don't respect ethical norms in our own behavior
as long as we don't care about the truth we'll find that we'll find plenty of foreigners who
are happy uh to to to use that against us and exploit our weaknesses
what do you what is what do you think of the idea that america is this
moral high ground of the earth of the world and uh and you know russia is this evil empire you
know obviously it's no one would argue the fact that putin and the history of it has been
is been
evil throughout its existence the evil things have been done by all of these leaders
and dictators but what is i guess what gives credence to the idea that america is so much
better and america's morals should be imposed throughout the world well i think you hit it
yourself when you pointed out that we have nothing in our history like the kind of horrors that have
have characterized the history of countries like russia and ukraine um you know in ukraine
millions of people were deliberately starved to death well we don't have that here in the u.s
and you know in the soviet union there was a great terror people were
um in the course of about a little over a year a hundred seven hundred thousand people were shot
you know on on falsified charges who i mean we we haven't had that experience here uh
you know there there you know the nazis set up death death camps gas chambers i mean we we
we've never built gas chambers here for eliminating people who are completely innocent right
so uh you know the case can be made that that america being a stable democracy and also
the most powerful country in the world economically uh is is not only
a good candidate for world leadership but even is obliged to assume that role for the sake of
everybody else because we you know other countries uh i mean other countries talk about american
domination what they're talking about is the ability of democratic ideals to to undermine
undermine the power of various dictatorial leaders we talked about this on the phone a
couple days ago but i present i mean there's there's the idea that or some people are saying
maybe the u.s shouldn't have anything to do with this russia ukraine conflict like
should we stay out of it what is a what what what is our business funneling billions of
dollars into ukraine to give them weapons and training to fight russia like why why not let
russia do what they do let them let them take over ukraine we could we could do that we could just
say you know go ahead and brutalize ukraine and and uh take it over uh but then the whole world
becomes less stable because uh if we are in a situation with in which any country is free to
just grab any part of any country that they like or dominate any country or invade any country or
attack any country uh you've got lots of candidates uh war could break out everywhere
and it leads it gives a free hand to uh leaders like putin to use terror and and in in their own
interests i mean they're already carrying out assassinations all over western europe ignoring
you know the sovereignty of european countries they've they they their suspicions they've carried
out assassinations in the us they the only reason they don't do more of that is because they they are
to some extent constrained a peaceful world and a world that respects the rule of law
is an advantage actually to everyone
i wonder if the us didn't put all those arms into the ukraine if there would be
much of all this fighting and all this death if they if they weren't sort of
preempted to fight back against russia like what what would happen if we had nothing to do with it
would it be the same outcome would there be all this fighting are we not is america not
isn't it in and is it not in our best interest to funnel all this money into the ukraine and
prop up our military military industrial complex and prop up our media and and portray uh zelensky
as this hero this war hero well off and put him in put him on the oscars not that we did that but
we were talking about getting him he may he may yet get an oscar but the uh
uh a support for a a con if if let's say if we don't support ukraine
uh we're going to have a very difficult time supporting those countries that are in nato
and because uh although nato by and large taken as a whole has a strategic advantage over russia
russia does have the strategic advantage vis-a-vis the baltik republics uh and uh they could overrun
those republics very quickly uh and the baltik publics could overrun no no no the russia could
overrun the baltik republics okay that you know ukraine has a population of 40 40 some odd million
estonia is one million uh latvia is just a little bit more so it would be no problem
they they could occupy them very quickly as long if they lose their fear
if it and uh having successfully taken over ukraine without any resistance from the us and any move
to to support the ukrainian uh uh resistance uh under those circumstances uh russia could easily
intimidate the baltiks it could intimidate the countries of nato and uh
uh they have they have they have territorial claims in those countries too by the way
and uh if if they were to succeed then the nato alliance would would fall apart
and every country would make their own deal with russia and we would be faced with a situation in
europe in which a country like russia which is uh you know run by people who are capable of
of take of of of seizing power by indiscriminately murdering their own people would be the dominant
power in europe and that would threaten american security because we would have you know within
the absence of allies uh of reliable allies or in a world in which those who are former allies
were making deals uh with it with an aggressive power like russia uh we would have very limited
ability to withstand them and we and we would have have very limited ability to react to their
provocations what if they were to what if they were to decide to carry out terrorist acts uh on
the territory of the united states under those conditions our our our advantage our strategic
goal is to expand the sphere of security peace and rule by law to the greatest extent possible
and if we can't
prevent countries like russia uh from behaving in in in barbarous uh in a barbarous fashion
at least you know we can limit the damage and contain them to some extent
do you think that what first of all what do you think
putin the psychology of putin is after all of these years of the us constantly trying to
destabilize creating nato basically essentially surrounding russia like i mean we have what 14
countries are a part of nato up to the border of russia
well who are those countries i mean those are countries that were previously dominated by russia
the baltik republics were part of the soviet union
the uh eastern european countries were satellite countries that whose armies were part of the
war saw packed uh now the so those countries know what it means to be dominated by russia
that's why they wanted to be part of nato okay not because they wanted to attack russia but
because they wanted to make sure they wouldn't be dominated again in the future as they were in the
past that's the whole meaning i mean the uh but aren't those countries essentially influenced
completely by the us uh no they're not completely influenced by the us but as members of nato
they're part of a defensive alliance and in fact we you uh we have we have many instances in which
there are disagreements within that alliance uh particularly on the matter of defense especially
between the us and germany but uh the us for example is opposed to many name nato countries
getting their gas from russia for particularly for exactly this reason that it weakens our ability
to contain russia right but the those countries who suffered under russian domination and now even
and that includes nato countries and non nato countries like ukraine and georgia and maldova
they they they they were concerned to become members of nato not because they intend to attack
russia but simply so that they would have protection against being dominated in the future the way they
were dominated in the past now the you it's very interesting that that russia has directed its
aggressivity against non nato members georgia and ukraine georgia was invaded in 2008 ukraine was
invaded in 2014 the nato countries were not invaded but but they could have been had they
not been part of nato i mean estonia is not a match for russia uh estonia has only a million
people and there are parts of estonia right on the border with russia that are completely russian
speaking and inhabited by ethnic russians now those people don't necessarily want to be part of
russia but russia could always claim that it's acting to defend them whether they want to be
defended or not right whatever is convenient yeah so that this this this whole explanation that we
were trying to destabilize russia's or that there was some kind of ill intent toward russia
there was only the intent to make sure that countries uh that had been part of the warsaw
pact and had been part of the soviet union could no longer be the subject of various intrigues
and attempts at destabilization they would have that that stability and they would have of course
the uh the reinforcement of nato for the democratic institutions
that brings me back to you bring you bring up georgia that brings me to one of the main
points i wanted to ask you about was odessa which was something happened in odessa after
maydan after cremia right yeah um it was armed groups from maydan showed up and they burned a
building killing 15 russians the trade union headquarters much more than 15 people they
they weren't russians they were they were pro russian right they were the pro you know there was
there was uh kind of but uh that that was a very complex complex event and the what is the significance
of odessa by the way of that region well it's biggest ukrainian port right surrounded by water
well not surrounded by water but it's on the water okay and uh the the burning of the trade union
building i mean that was that was that it's one of the things that still hasn't been fully
investigated to my satisfaction but it appears that it was the pro russian elements that got
that started the the confrontation and then both sides got out of hand um but i wouldn't uh um
that was used by russian propaganda to recruit people for the war in eastern ukraine the the
and the the trip but the the russian press coverage cannot be taken at face value because
they were that in fact they may have it may have even been a deliberate russian so provocation
i think on the one of the ukrainian the ukrainian nationalist uh there's one of those neo nazi
militias they celebrated this on their website that none of their groups no one died on their side
it was all well they're capable of of anything i mean there were ukrainian pro ukrainians who did die
uh and shots were fired when you know there were two groups the police the the the big mystery about
the odessa events when the trade and the the fire in the trade union building was why the police
didn't intervene why not i mean what what was going on i have not seen a satisfactory answer
right but i think that uh you know we have to look at the you know there's in these with these
countries there can be a lot of provocations in both directions you know on on all sides
but you we have you know we need to look at the broad the the big big picture here the big picture
is this that ukraine is an independent country that it had free elections that power changed
hands poroshenko lost the election he gave up power a new president became uh became the
nation's leader as a result of a democratic election you don't see that in russia right
and also that uh it's up to the ukrainian people to decide you know who they belong you know
what their nation is not for the russians to decide that so if russia says that ukraine is part of
russia uh that's wonderful that they have that opinion but that that's a decision that they
can't make right and uh at the same time an unprovoked uh invasion against a country which
for all its faults is nonetheless uh democratic and moving in the direction of western ideals
by a country that is uh ruled really by people who still have the psychology of the communists and
the soviet union and who have no respect for human life their the lives of russian soldiers or of
ukrainians talking about the people invading currently yeah i mean there's just no question i
mean you know as far as uh as uh where where right exists in this well a lot of these people that
are invading currently they're just kids right they don't even know what they're doing or why
they're absolutely true and they're being slaughtered in the thousands and many don't want to be there
and they and they and in violation of all rules because under the under the uh you know you cannot
under the the law in russia you cannot send draftees into a war zone and they're sending
them there with little or no training right after they were drafted right after that microphone
right under your or your scoot scoot that way yeah i'm sorry yeah um i want to go back real
real quick so so in odessa yeah the guy who became the president of odessa was from georgia
right well he wasn't the president of odessa he was the the governor the governor right yeah
that was the former that was uh sakashvili who is the former uh leader of georgia yeah
right and uh he worked closely with the united states there's many photos of him with george bush
he also worked for a new york law firm who represented ngo and then um there's also been
he this guy even who's now the governor of odessa he's posted on his facebook page
that he gets paid the 200 000 a year by the u.s government which is more than the governor of main
so again things like this just raise all these questions like why is the u.s government paying
the governor of odessa 200 000 a year well i think in the case of of of i mean i i don't i
don't know the situation so i can't answer but i think that when things like that uh uh surface
when questions surface uh you know on what basis you know if if the government is doing it there's
a record of it and uh and that i mean that in itself is is is an important thing we have public
accountability in this country and i think it rather than just repeating things that whose
significance we don't understand i would i would treat it as a question and just say well what's
the expo you know and right seek the answer right um if there's if there's something wrong with it it
can you know our in our system it can be corrected well it just kind of like it just makes me question
the it makes me question putin putin's motives right if you see like for you have to forgive my
ignorance of the history i can only watch so many documentaries you know and read so many articles
but when i see things like this like like odessa essentially becoming a united state in the us
run by a god that no that didn't happen and and and he's not governor anymore he's not governor
anymore okay no and uh i mean this is you know we we exist in the um in the era of
bad information when i was young it was a long time ago there were only a handful of people who
entitled to an opinion and these were the columnists the leading national columnists who wrote
for the big newspapers of walter lippman james reston joe allsop they had an opinion they could
express it everybody else could vote or they could you know express their opinions to their
friends and families within the four walls of their homes or the homes of other people
then later the the the area of you know the possibilities expanded there began to be op-ed
pages where you know more people could express an opinion that would get read and discussed
and then uh but but with the internet now uh everybody has an opinion if they want to
and we we have something we just didn't have before somebody says something stupid and that's
a major news event and then somebody says something it's even more stupid in answer
to the first stupid remark and you've got a continuing story uh as we without you know in
a previous year and none of that would be considered newsworthy the you know the dumb
remarks that people make so we so we're now we have a great expansion of the amount of opinion
and information that's circulating but uh it hasn't led to our being you know kind of more
enlightened on the contrary it's just led to greater and greater confusion and mutual abuse
now these you know the these i would say more people have become more enlightened
what you wouldn't you wouldn't think more people have i mean it obviously well we can we can look
at it i mean i don't think so i think that i mean just the level of hatred in the society
tells you the opposite right uh we've got you you know uh you know families people fighting
with each other family members fighting with each other children you know refusing to speak to their
parents and parents refusing but i think mostly it's the children but but make world goes both ways
uh you know people identifying themselves more and more in terms of their very superficial
political views on issues that they don't really understand uh and uh so i think and i think that
this is in part the internet i think it's part the and i see it of course with russia and ukraine
because these these are areas that i'm familiar with and i see the you know the the the flood of
of uninformed opinion and and and meaningless factoids that are that that that are circulated
as a basis for suspicions that nobody tries to analyze or investigate we we're in a bad way
i mean what we what what's what's real gold in the present situation is is uh genuinely
uh researched an informed opinion but that is an infinitesimal part of the public dialogue right now
and uh so it's no wonder that we you know i mean how we get you know get our act together
to do anything visa v foreign countries is it is a miracle you know we we did not prevent
the attack on ukraine the invasion of ukraine had we you know what we but that was this was a
preventable war had the u.s been a country in a society that was more in control of itself
less divided against itself we wouldn't have done a lot of things we wouldn't have left
to afghanistan and betrayed an entire people we would have been able to prevent the attack on
ukraine i mean so far it you know the consequences for our own country have have have been limited
but that doesn't mean that other people haven't suffered and we don't know what the future holds
the why did putin attack ukraine why did he make that decision well of course there was
the example of afghanistan but it was also all the crazy stuff that's going on inside american
society uh and the assessment of foreigners that the u.s will not be will will not resist
that the western societies will not resist what is actually an unmistakable act of aggression
now in as it happens there has been some resistance but but
you know a more coherent society a more focused society a government which had placed some value
on expertise could have could have prevented this you know the killing that's going on right now
i mean we saw what happened and we we've seen the mass the mass killings just announced in butcha
outside of kiv and we see the bodies all you know on the streets and the mass graves i mean
they've it's all been photographed uh so uh you know all this talk it's great i mean people love to
talk and well there's two main narratives right i mean that's the major difference between the
us and a country like russia like you say like in russia everything's curated you live in you
live in this different fantasy world and you have to have these covert underground ways to get real
news well that was the soviet the soviet union right yeah so much anymore right well now it's
more voluntary now it's more now they have very they eliminate alternative sources of information
but not completely but but they play on nationalism they play on people's weaknesses
and the difference in the u.s is that we generally how u.s but we also play out you know the various
forces play on on people's weaknesses but there's more than one force there's two two main forces
right or at least two the right the right wing the fox news and the cnn well yeah i mean the the the
in both cases
the the the level of of thought and analysis is not high oftentimes right but at least there's
more than you know it isn't there isn't just a one uh view that that completely dominates
uh the information space in russia there the it's the view of the government and and and and
fox news and cnn are not part of the government they're there well did you did you did you know
i maybe not the fact that cnn hires i believe i forget the percentage maybe you can find this
but there's a large percentage of or i'm stating this wrong the most
retired pentagon officials there's a huge percentage of them that get hired by cnn well
and and former intelligence and former intelligence right yeah which they shouldn't do well the
i mean first of all there's a difference here i mean the former intel pentagon officials who
are commenting on strictly military matters uh and i mean i think that's okay but intelligence
officials who are offering their partisan opinions and basing it you know and and cloaking
themselves with the prestige of the intelligence agencies that's outrageous it's just a one you
know the best thing about what's happening to media in my point of view is that now by and large
people are are looking at these big major conglomerate monopoly media organizations like fox and cnn
and their people aren't taking them as seriously as they used to we kind of look at them as like the
wwf now like right like like they're well i think that the cable television has been discredited
and in part because of its own dishonesty but the but the okay that it's good they're discredited
but it's bad that they behave in a way which discredits them the thing is it doesn't stop
people from watching them well it's becomes entertainment and of course the thing is we're
feeding you know we're feeding very much into uh a a bad cycle where uh people are driven by their
emotions we lost the cold when the cold war ended america turned in in turned away from the outside
world and and and turned inward uh and then we began to concentrate on a lot of issues that
although not very significant or actually very divisive identity issues for example
which translate oftentimes into who gets which jobs uh uh you know education which uh
uh is a question of how children are are going to be you know raised and by whom the schools are by
the parents i think all things that are that have a very high potential for mutual irritation uh and
that those are those issues and not the you know the the broader issues of of of defending you
know kind of basic democratic values in the world and preventing aggression you know establish
guaranteeing world peace uh those issues uh have become uh you know really dominate the public
space and the the appearance of trump as a phenomenon uh is uh in part explained by the by the
fact that a large part of the population in the united states rightly or wrongly feels aggrieved
by the way in which uh these issues are being to are being depicted in the mainstream media
and in and in the culture now uh
and the result is that america is more and more is divided in a way that it and you know
it's you know who has the biggest mouth oftentimes right uh
uh and the country is weakened and we lack the ability to do what uh we need to do
uh you know both both to take care of our internal problems such as they are but also to to to help
to ensure a decent world and a peaceful peaceful world and a world without the kind of aggression
that we're seeing in in ukraine and a a world in which uh uh you know we don't have thousands and
thousands of young guys in the course of a week of a month i mean we know the the combined death toll
in in in ukraine ukrainians and russians it must be now over 20 000 uh and uh in during the entire
afghan war 10 years uh that the soviet union fought in afghanistan the death toll was 15 000 now this
only one month this is a real slaughter what do you think the best course of action is for the
us as far as involvement in the ukraine like how how far do we go it seems like if we keep doing
what we're doing now this just drags on and on and on and on and some people call for like a no
fly zone which would be an act of war if we shot down a if we actually shot down a russian jet uh
well it's a quite active war is hard i mean on the subject of a no fly zone uh
if that uh uh russian jet is intruding over ukrainian airspace ukrainian airspace belongs
to ukraine not to russia uh and they were shot down i mean they could interpret it as an act of
war and on the other hand i mean by us but yeah i mean by the us now if the us were to destroy
anti-aircraft barriers on russian territory uh that would be an act of war but only you know uh uh
but not necessarily you know if if if those if those um those anti-aircraft batteries had been
used to shoot down american uh aircraft patrolling ukrainian airspace at the request of legitimate
ukrainian uh uh government then uh your retaliation against those those those air air
those anti-aircraft installations i'm not sure on the question of how it would be defined but it
could be considered legitimate retaliation but um the the the thing what i'm i think that for the
moment uh what's really critical is not the military side of it but the total embargo of oil and gas
exports uh no money should go into russia and none should come out uh that and the the united
states doesn't want to risk the lives of american soldiers and i understand this are american pilots
uh we already gave them tons of drones right oh we're giving and we and the now the question
is are we going to move from a defensive weapons to offensive weapons oh we can do that too
but but the but but more important i mean and that this is what people are talking are are talking
about but in my view the what is much more critical right now is a total embargo on the purchase of
russian oil and gas now that means worldwide worldwide that means that uh germany now of
course we're lucky it's spring i mean that sounds easy it isn't easy it means a complete
reorientation of the economy uh you know because we would have to compensate the germans and the
would europeans for for the gas and the oil that they're not getting i mean there were a lot of
things would have would it and it would have an effect on the environmental legislation and a lot
of other things because we would have to increase our energy production but i mean that's that's
the way i mean a no-fly zone would have been great before the invasion right uh now it does
risk a confrontation which is unpredictable and we of course i mean i think our you know
biden is correct that he in in his reluctance to risk american lives i mean no one we don't want
that right but but uh but we have to be ready for the sacrifices and for the the the uh the changes
that are going to come if we really this is something that i think no one talks about but
i think one of the things i think there's a recorded uh interview meeting that trump had
with germany yeah the leaders of germany pressing them on why they're not cutting off their oil
why they're not figuring out how to become independent of russian oil yeah yeah i mean
that's and trump made a very good point i mean and it was so much about trump is controversial
and a hate inspiring that that that uh the good that he did and he did do some good things and in
fact him the the in the middle east and elsewhere uh he did some remarkable things uh is is either
ignored or misrepresented but what the point he was making toward nato is that germany's neglecting
its its contribution to nato while at the same time financing a potential ad adversary right
that's an excellent point it was very important that that someone make it and he did uh now what is
the what is the importance of a lot of people don't understand this including me what is the
significance of sanctioning all these oligarch oligarchs oligarchs is that how you say oligarchs
well oligarchs and these people who have these yachts all over the world and not letting them
use their yachts like what how do these people why are they so important to put in uh they're less
important to put in then uh uh then we realize uh but by paralyzing their ability to borrow money
we we strike a blow at the at the uh at the russian economy which is what we've got to do
hmm i mean these are they have business empires that that that require credit among other things
and the the confiscation of the yachts and the you know the estates and so on
is actually not all that significant in uh in terms of the war i'm much more
significant is the freezing of the assets of the russian central bank that's that that's significant
uh but here and i wrote this in the wall street journal uh the the yachts and the estates have
a lot of symbolic importance inside russia as an example of how the country was robbed
and how it was robbed under the present putin leadership and and and those and of course
you know these people were involved in all kinds of illegal activities often in cooperation with
the putin regime and uh there those assets should be uh you know once that's demonstrated when
that's probably a long process those those assets should be uh should be confiscated
what is your with all your history spending all that time over there which is super rare
there's there's got to be very very few people who have like the the experience you have the first
person experience living over there and experiencing these people in these these countries and what
is there anything that you fear is there is there one thing that you fear most
in situations like we're in right now and you see what's going on you see the decisions that
are being made you see the main talking points that are going on in the media is there something
that they're missing that you see well i you know as i've said repeatedly and i've said
in the wall street journal and elsewhere that the key the key to to reaching out to the russian
people and to showing them that their government that their government has is just as much their
enemy as it is the enemy of the ukrainian people is to is is to talk about how putin came to power
with an act of terror against his own people and that that is you know and the our our our our
we are very obtuse when it comes to the the whole history you know these are pure these the people
who in our government call themselves russia experts are only bureaucrats who who in fact have
no real firsthand knowledge or very little and but but are good at calling attention to themselves
i mean the the whole history of the criminal activities in russia from the very beginning
actually under geltsin uh is something that we need to call to the attention of the russian
people but we have to understand it ourselves and the others but the what what do i fear in
this situation is that they'll carry out they they're capable of carrying out especially if
putin feels threatened carrying out atrocities against the civilian population in ukraine that
will literally force us to do something like if they dropped some sort of a tactical nuke on
ukraine or on or if they or if they used even thermobaric weapons against civilian populations
or carried out some kind of horrific massacre they have they have already used one of the
hypersonic missiles i think the hypersonic the the the um yeah uh they have they they attacked an
facility in western ukraine but the the that that depends i mean the yield of the warhead
is not necessarily i mean the speed is there but and it can't be stopped right that's the
benefit of the hypersonic because yeah but the it doesn't necessarily mean that it's it's a high yield
a warhead but um and then uh you know we could be faced with a situation which they they create for
us in which either we stand by and allow that to happen or we or we really do take air you know
steps to protect the innocent civilian population either with a no-fly zone zone or with a humanitarian
airlift you know let's say that there's they surround a major ukrainian citizen
city and people are left are starving to death and you know and we're faced with a situation to
we mount an airlift to get them food and and medicine uh and uh and uh you know if we do so
would russians fire there you know that this situation is is full of full of possibilities
for confrontation we're avoiding them so far uh but we while managing somehow to aid the
ukrainians but the problem is that aid to the ukrainians and rescuing the ukrainians at some
point may may uh involve greater and greater risk i'm not sure that we're going to be able to get
out of this thing without totally without risk that's the problem even though we don't want to
take any risks i mean it's a risk to allow them to to to carry out you know crimes against humanity
while we're standing by and not doing anything to stop it because after all ukraine is a friendly
country to us right and that would embolden them to try the same thing with countries like stonia
latvia lithuania much better to try to stop it now than to have to stop it under much worse
conditions you know someplace else so are you saying that best case scenario would be regime
change in russia that's absolutely the best case scenario but it's something they and it could happen
but it won't happen because what we do it'll happen that that's up to the russian people
and by the way it's not unrealistic because after 18 months of war in chechnya the russian people were
were ready to withdraw troops from chechnya at any price at any and just even if it meant complete
surrender and yeltsin at that time said that he could he could not win reelection if if the war
was not not brought to an end and he did bring it to an end and they did withdraw isn't biden already
talking about regime change though i mean well he made a missy he made a he made a comment that we've
got to get rid of this guy uh referring to in the white house tried to try to like save him try to
walk walk it back and then he came out again saying no absolutely he's a butcher he called him a butcher
yeah well you know none of that makes much difference tell you the honest truth he can
say anything he wants i mean the the uh but what is that doesn't that give doesn't that give russia
a stronger hand like look look he wants regime change no i don't you think that feeds into their
propaganda isn't that what they want oh well they'll use that in their propaganda oh yeah for sure
in their propaganda inside the country but it's not critical to their propaganda they've been
you know they they are uh doesn't they've been they've been saying that anyway they've been
saying that even without biden's of course but this kind of proves it right yeah i mean
the thing is that you know the the real situation is the the destabilization is not any is not the
result of any words that biden says but rather the fact that they've attacked a country with
you know 120 000 or 150 000 troops and are bombing indiscriminately and they're killing
civilians and uh this country which was at peace with them and was not threatening them
what happens if we do get regime change in russia and now we're in now we have some sort of a
president in russia that is an ally to us and that i don't think any any any any any country any
change from what i know about the internal political situation in russia nobody who replaces
putin if someone if someone replaces him will be an uh a a puppet of the united states it would
no no it would it would have to be someone the the opposition would have to come from the military
and the security services on the grounds that putin was destroying the country and the the war
had to stop in order to save russia and under those circumstances uh those people uh you know they
would they would not necessarily uh be friendly to the west or to the us and they would cause trouble
but they would try they would try to reestablish some kind you know get the the economy back on
its feet and the war and and and end the end the existing crisis uh but uh whether those forces
are strong enough to do that we don't know because that we know they exist we know they exist because
before the uh before the invasion uh general liana the iva shoff who is uh very high ranking
retired general was was very high ranking and is now the head of an association of retired
military and intelligence officers in russia uh said publicly that a war with ukraine would be
an absolute disaster and it was just being undertaken to prop up this senescent regime
and uh and you know the the members of the board of this organization supported him now if these
guys were willing to say that publicly then you can be sure that that opinion opinion is held in
the military by a lot of people who just aren't don't feel that they can express themselves
so i mean the the the sentiment exists the people exist uh they are you know from what we understand
that there's surveillance uh going on inside the leadership everyone is being spied on but
you know they could the you know if the if russia suffers catastrophic defeats they could they could
intervene and find enough support to remove putin inside the country without the us having
anything to do with it if i'm thinking from the us's point of view if we want if we do want if the
goal is true that we do want regime change in russia that's a huge risk no matter who gets in
because anyone in control of all those nuclear weapons is a massive risk not only to the us
but to the world so wouldn't the us's first priority would be to declaw so to speak russia
and get rid of those or take possession of all of the new we don't have the ability to do that
and it isn't even necessary i mean what's necessary right now is is is to end the war
to get the russians to withdraw and to get a peace settlement that that will be uh that they will
respect and that will uh you know assure the integrity of ukraine that would under those
conditions i mean if something like that can be worked out and it's you know tall order then the
next step of course is to you know slowly reestablish economic relations and try to kind of get the
you know which which which of course you get you know that would that would benefit everybody
i think that after this experience though the the the the dependency of the west on russia
energy is going to be a lot less because we've seen the risks and i think there'll be a much
greater drive toward diversification of source of energy sources on the part of countries like
germany which is you know the pivotal very pivotal country well david we just did over three hours
