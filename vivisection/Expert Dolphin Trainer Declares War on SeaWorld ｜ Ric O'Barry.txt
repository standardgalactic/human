Hello everybody! If you don't know who Rick O'Berry is, he is a legendary dolphin activist
who's known for the documentary The Cove that won the Academy Award as well as every other award
a documentary could possibly win. It's all about the dolphin trafficking and the dolphin slaughter
that goes on in Taiji Japan. He went down there to expose the secret slaughter that goes on every
year and the billions of dollars that's made from it. We also get into his friend John Lilly
and his NASA-funded research on non-human intelligence involving dolphins back in the
day when he was working on Flipper and all kinds of other crazy stuff. This episode's packed with
gems and I know you guys are gonna love it. So please hammer that subscribe button below the
video if you haven't already and enjoy the show. All right Rick thank you so much for coming man
it's an honor to have you on here I've been trying to get you on the show for years. Oh I didn't know
that I would have showed up earlier. I didn't know you were in St. Pete. Last time I heard
you were in like in Indonesia then you were in Denmark and then you were in Tahiti who know you're
still trot in the world and you're in your early 80s is that right? 84 yeah. That's incredible
that you're still moving around like that. Yeah when I came here a year ago I didn't expect to
I was hoping to stay on the beach for a little while but I've been in Portugal and
Japan, Denmark, Norway, Sweden chasing a whale up the coast Beluga whale. I haven't been here
very much actually but you got a nice place here. Thanks. I appreciate it. I haven't seen much of it yet.
Well there's not much to see except for this room and the room we were just in
but um you said you said you were chasing a Beluga whale? A Beluga whale by the name of
Valdemir yeah escaped from the Russian navy. It's believed nobody knows for sure but
there are a lot of there are several people who work in that in Russia with the Russian dolphins
have worked with these Beluga whales who confirmed that he was a Russian spy whale
so we don't have any data like a birth certificate and it's important because
dolphins that are born in captivity are very different from dolphins that are
born in the wild. They're a completely different animal. Many of these
dolphins right here in fact Clearwater probably and SeaWorld and these places are around here
all over Europe and places especially northern Europe where the climate is cold
um they suffer from the cold weather I believe because all of the dolphins every one of them
in Europe for example originally were captured in Florida near here near Pine Island Florida or Cuba
so they are indeed subtropical creatures nobody ever thinks about that I think about it when
I'm standing outside the Hagenbeck Zoo in Hamburg Germany with snow up to my knees and it's winds
blowing and it's freezing cold and I'm out there protesting and nobody thinks when they buy a ticket
they're going to go inside this building you know they're going to see dolphins that were captured
in Florida there that shouldn't be here in the first place so we try to expose all of these
things hoping that people will think twice before they buy a ticket for a dolphin show that's what
we do. So going back to that the Russian spy whale yeah Valdemir I'll go back there I'm just
waiting right now for the ice to melt because the ice on the roads we have a home in Denmark and
we'll put my wife Helene and I will put the car what we do is put the car on the ferry boat
and we go to Sweden drive off and then we have people on the ground who know where Valdemir is
and we're in touch with them and we'll drive there we'll follow him all the way up the coast from
Sweden to Norway last time we were there but now it's really frozen and dangerous to to drive for
me especially because it's ice and snow and I'm not used to it. So do you think they have him
like retrofitted with some sort of like radio transmitters or some cameras and stuff yeah he
showed up with cameras go pros he's wearing a harness what canvas harness is there photos of this
yeah you can google it in Valdemir and Valdemir the spy whale so this is not live is it no it's not
live okay because you can you can insert yes voiceover I'll tell you where those that footage
well Steve I'll send you some actually Steve actually he's on the computer he can actually
google stuff like as we're talking and he can pull it up and show it to us so it's H-V-A-L-D-I-M-I-R
Valdemir he was featured in the New York Times cover of the New York Times magazine about two weeks
ago the big four or five page story photograph good images
this guy see there's the hardest there wow no way oh yeah he's very underweight here you can't tell
but I can't write the one on the lower left he's fairly uh yeah he's in bad shape there wow that's
what he left the Arctic Circle and started traveling towards Sweden and Denmark that's when I left here
and got on the first plane and tried to interrupt him turn him around because he will not find another
beluga whale once he leaves the Arctic Circle and starts heading in that direction he's going in
the wrong direction that's so sad man yeah and he is the friendliest of all the dolphins I've worked
with and I've worked with a lot of dolphins and whales in the last you know before flipper 60
something years he is by far the friendliest and he just goes right up to people like if he could
hug of them he would and my fear is he's going to be transferred to the an area in the north of
Norway where there are about 300 hungry polar bears and uh so that's all the bears will get him
I don't know I mean nobody knows you would never be able to monitor him there but the nor
this whale swam into the largest whaling nation on planet earth right right so the government
what we've been trying to do the dolphin project at least we've been trying to get the government
to step up and take responsibility to actually make him a citizen and let him and assign a cadre of
five or six could be coast guard or forest rangers or somebody to be there with him
and there are some civilians to see in that photograph they're doing that but the government
should do that the government just wants to get rid of him he's the embarrassment
really yeah if they protect him well how about the other whales you're killing you're killing more
whales than anybody on the planet russia no this is this is norway oh norway okay russia did
they stopped but now it's norway island japan so norway's killing more whales than japan
yeah wow since when uh the last year or two uh that's crazy norway they've now become the
largest of numbers how many whales they killed that's based on how many they killed so
so he swam into you know and i i'd like for him to stay right there and bring as much media
attention as he can to the fact that norway is killing whales unnecessarily they don't have to do
this so there are fish farms that's what these guys here you're looking at on this photograph
um work at the fish farm these are salmon farms norway is a very very rich country and they make
their money on oil and salmon almost all salmon you eat now worldwide is from norway interesting
don't eat it it's if you knew if you well it was exposed on sea spiracy
there's a movie on death flicks everybody should see if you are still eating salmon
go to death flicks and look at sea spiracy why what's wrong with the salmon it's disgusting
what they it's just i don't want to people are eating when they're watching the show
it's okay we can it doesn't matter we can we can make them throw up it it is disgusting they only
are what you they shovel in there to them so like you mean like they're raised on farms right they're
farm salmon they're fed uh in these very large circular sea pens that are used that's they call
that the farm and uh yeah it's disgusting it's dangerous don't eat it where do you if you have
to eat salmon you look for uh salmon from uh sometimes you can find it at whole foods it's
from alaska mm-hmm wild caught from alaska doesn't have mercury and all the problems that you find
all the other salmon even the color of this beautiful salmon color when you go to the sushi
place that's fake if you saw the color of it you wouldn't need buy it in the first place gray is
actually gray it's that color is that color really yeah because of what they feed it they feed a
garbage wow and so people be dressing up in the sushi market it looks wonderful but it's all fake
so so for people that don't know uh you have one of the most famous and legendary uh documentaries
that have come out in the last couple decades is the cove which won an academy award won us
ungodly amount of awards all of them won every single award um one of the most you know famous
wildlife documentaries that has ever been known um when they were making that documentary
is it something you were a part of from the start or or did these guys just sort of discover you
and decide to make a documentary about you well there's no these guys it's it's like everything
else like this podcast this is your baby so there is somebody there who and that would be
louis ahoyus that was his project uh and how it started he it was a phone call from san diego
i was in coconut grove he calls and introduced himself and said i just saw your i didn't make
the cove by the way right i'm not a filmmaker but i didn't make a short um film video with uh
diane theater who is a uh what would you call her she's an artist a video artist and she and she's
cinematographer a video artist okay that works i don't know it's different than what you do in
documentaries okay they show i don't but she did a proper doc and um it's not something you would
put on television because it's so graphic it's really meant for a journalist if a journalist
calls me and says what's this all about i can show them i can't explain it it it's so over the top
what happens at the cove in taiji if i had to explain it to you i wouldn't be able to well
you've seen it so you know right but if i show you something you know you might get interested
and get involved there's no words so we made this one and louis sahoyas was in san diego
at a marine mammal conference i was scheduled as the keynote speaker and i was going to show my
15 minute film at the last minute seaworld said we're scrapping that oh barry can't speak and that
piqued louis curiosity why can't he speak because he's speaking about dolphins in captivity
dolphins being captured at the cove in taiji the capture of the dolphins and the sale of those
dolphins is indeed the economic underpinning of the slaughter it's not about meat it's about
live dolphins for dolphin shows so louis said
so he said can i i saw that i saw that uh i saw that uh video you made
although seaworld wouldn't show it somebody showed it to me and i'm wondering if i can follow you
around with my camera i said well what what what is it you're doing he said we're doing a
up at your phone that body yeah i should have shut that off that's okay you can answer if you
have to that's a good question it's leaking the real yeah no worries hello yeah i should
do
then they have told the april 22nd to make it the premises can you repeat that please i
i'm doing the interview right now and daddy's here in front of me and he and the photographer
can hear what's up lincoln repeat said the city of mighty day just terminated are you rolling
rams lease well that's wonderful
they they they terminated the lease for who this might be sequering
it's over we won wow that's amazing yeah i'm gonna hold you the uh phone up to the microphone
repeat that one more time please
the mighty dave county and the mayor's office just issued a letter of termination for the lease
for the mining sea aquarium for the dolphin company dolphin company has until april 22nd
april 21st to vacate the premises no what a beautiful thing i've been trying to do this is
1970 really today it happened on your show live okay lincoln thanks i gotta get back to work
thanks legan look at that phew what are the chances that you just got the news right now
that's amazing and you you guys have been trying to do that since the 70s since 1970 when when uh
hugo and the low leader arrived at the mighty sea aquarium i quit i went out
in front of the sequel i was the head trader get a bit closer i lived there at the sea aquarium
in the house that was the flipper set right and i uh
and when the orcas arrived and i left the mighty sea aquarium now i'm standing outside the gate
not allowed inside even though i had the keys to the place of my pocket still because i lived
there right and uh and i've started protesting and i'm standing out in front of the sea aquarium
with a sign i don't know what it said cars going by honk if you're and nobody would honk of course
people were going like this and people were laughing at me even people in the animal welfare
industry these big groups i was trying to get them come and join us uh
uh they would laugh at me really what are you talking about dolphin captivity that's not an
issue that's not a real issue and they were laughing today it's a mainstream issue and all
those big groups who would not get involved how now i have sort of taken over this issue with her
so so going back real quick i want to get i want to get to them um i want to jump back to the early
days of flipper and everything after after we get finished what we're talking about with the uh
when you first went to san diego to do the conference and seaworld banned you from the
conference i didn't go to the conference i wasn't i wasn't allowed they were showing the film
and louis was there i know i'm not going to be allowed to get into seaworld to them every day
if you talk to any seaworld trainer i talked to one yesterday when you go to buy a ticket
all of those ticket booths have my photograph there if i show up they have uh
instructions to call the police at that's not only the seaworld that's the aquarium marine land
all these places so i wasn't there but the film is going to be shown finally and uh
but it didn't so louis said can i go with you and i'll i'll film it that's what what is it you're
doing we're doing a television series like the old jacuzzo series you remember that yep he's asking
me that i said sure i remember everybody well we want to feature you in the first episode i said
well i'm here bring the cameras you were here meaning taiji yeah okay i'm going the next day
i said i'll be there tomorrow i'm going right now and how often did you go there i would go five or
six times a year when did you start going there uh 2003 i believe okay and so louis i said he said
can i photograph you i said sure he hung up the telephone and went out and took a three-day crash
course on how to make a movie he never made a movie he's telling this story we're in paris he and i and
luke basant the french filmmaker he was a distributor for the coven so the three of us
are sitting at this press conference and louis telling this story said so i told rick i'll
meet him in taiji and i hung up the phone and went out and took a three-day course on how to make a
movie here's a guy who never made a movie before his first movie wins academy award and every award
and uh jesus christ so i like telling filmmakers i told my son this story
and i i i was just in in uh portugal recently had a film school telling all of the students
trying to encourage them to go out and do what louis did anybody can do it and everybody should do it
uh so lincoln did that anyone out made a three-part television series for discovery
show blood dolphin blood dolphins now he's doing a feature film for uh dog wolf i think it's called
dog wolf dog wolf they did they do documentaries okay oh it's a company okay got it in london they
did uh the the the the documentary that won the academy award this year but it's called uh
nevalday nevalney okay that's their film right it's a profile piece now they're doing another
profile piece on what we're doing so that's exciting that's amazing yeah lincoln couldn't
win an academy award so you guys met up this is not in the shot is it no no no and uh they you said
i'm going to taiji the next day they said we'll meet you there and so he shows up he's got a one
little camera by himself and uh we're in a restaurant i took him to a restaurant that
night japanese restaurant and he leaves across the table he says so what what's his movie about
i thought god this is so encouraging because i have been doing interviews literally since
before flipper hundreds of men i i wrote a couple books in my writing partner
it was a journalist for so many years 30 years and he told me one time he said journalists aren't
looking for the truth they're looking for a story that stuck with me because that's what i experienced
all of these years i i put that together they're looking for a story right and usually they know
what that story is before they even interview me and here's a guy once in a while you'll get a
investigative journalist who has a blank mind and they're going to document what it is yes so that's
why i was excited right you haven't already made up your mind what this is just follow me around
you'll see right it is what it is right and that's how the co was made what was the response
from the people in because i mean watching that documentary it is quite literally astonishing
how many people are aware of you who are tailing you every day getting in your face trying to
intimidate you like it's a very very high level operation those fishermen have going there and
and you are the bane of their existence um i can't imagine the reaction you got after this
documentary not only dropped but won an academy award what was the reaction from those guys and from
the not just taiji but japan anger they don't want to be exposed like that and they know they know
that it's all true so they have to do damage control now and pretend that we're making all
of this stuff up and uh anger anger is what just made them angry or that's all that happened
how long after the film came out and won the academy award did you go back to taiji or did you go back
i never actually left i was there almost all the time uh oh wow it goes on six months a year
when when it starts it doesn't stop for six months every day right from september to march
yeah i'm constantly going back and forth and um i was doing a lot of hiding in those days
from because they're angry fishermen and um they're not the real threat though the real threat is the
the the akusa want to be the young guy who wants to be the akusa is very involved in fisheries in
japan and these live dolphin sales and anywhere there's money the akusa is in that neighborhood
for people listening who don't know can you explain what the akusa is the akusa is a japanese mafia
they're everywhere they're they're ubiquitous in japan they are in government they run the
government they they're everywhere and so the guy i'm afraid of is the young guy who's had too much
to drink uh makes a bad decision and something happens and that happens in japan you know not
so much with guns with knives you know it's guns are outlawed but um do you have to constantly look
over your shoulder guns are outlawed there i think they're outlawed that band you know you
don't find guns like you do here right um that's a good thing too because they're they get very
angry when you expose them like that it's something they just don't do in japan yeah japanese people
would never do that to one another their culture is very very different and you don't take sides
with westerners um so it's a very very difficult very difficult um campaign and we've been on it
since 2003 and we're still on it and we're not uh we're not having any results so we've tried
something new sue the bastards we've had very good success with suing them i've been arrested twice
on false charges and uh deported went to prison they took i took them to court and sued them
who specifically the uh the government of the japanese government yeah and i won that's never
happened before when i was in japan in september Lincoln and i were there filming we went to the
lawyer's office his law firm and he said this is congratulations this is the first case ever in
japanese history where somebody was deported sued the government went all the way to the supreme court
and won so i'm back whenever i want to go back that makes them just angrier so um our strategy now
is to sue them uh sea shepherd was there also another environmental group right there a couple
of other guys got arrested they also sued using the same law firm japanese law firm
they won so we have a good track record with this law firm and the supreme court the higher courts are
are much more fair than the lower courts so um we're going to keep the lawsuit going and and uh
yeah that's our new strategy have you ever sat down with one of these fishermen and had us to
a direct face-to-face conversation i've had many i've gone into like a cordial conversation yeah
and recorded it i would sometimes record them with a button cam or something like that and
and uh yeah we we've done that and and and uh
yeah what about that what what is it you want to know about that what what came out of that
what what was your sense which one there's a hundred i've been there any of them there's this
all of them together
they the thing i've taken have taken away from it is that they admitted they will stop
if it's illegal as long as it's legal we're going to do this you kill cows we kill these
you know beef looks like put it on a table cut it up you can't even tell the difference so
of course they're right about that this episode of the podcast is brought to you by
ron if you're a fan of this podcast you're already aware that i am one of the most stylish
best dressed people in the world not really but when i do have to go to a fancy event a dinner
party or even one of those fancy golf courses that makes you wear slacks and a collared shirt

check out ron today it's ron.com slash dany and you can get 20 off your entire order it's spelled
r-h-o-n-e dot com slash d-a-n-n-y for 20 off it's linked below now back to the show and
it's the way they kill them the way they're doing this and other improprieties illegalities are
being recorded so when you and we live stream when we're there we're live streaming everything we
have drones or small drones and we're looking for we're looking for illegalities and we funnel all
of that to the law firm and our next assault will be illegal in the courts there's so many
questions regarding the the ethics of what it is and compare like in the documentary
they're always coming up with different arguments to back up what they're doing
slaughtering these dolphins and one of them was it's pest control because they're eating too much
fish another one was you know like what you said earlier you guys slaughter cows or there's guy in
in people in australia they they slaughter kangaroos so why can't we slaughter our own dolphins
and yeah they're right too excuse me is there any sort of legal
loophole there that you can get around or that you can sort of lobby for to
ethics no ethics no it has to be something there's nothing based on like the intelligence of an
animal whether you can kill or not well you go to court and fight that for years and you
two sides are debating what intelligence is what is intelligence right no you will never
shut it down based on intelligence they will argue about that and intelligence some anthropologist
might tell you is the ability to adapt to your environment and survive that would make a cockroach
more intelligent than us they could survive a nuclear holocaust so that ain't it well what is it
and so you go down that road now it's got to be something breaking the laws of
japan you know very black and white and i can't then we have a lot of evidence of that and we're
building more i can't tell you publicly what that is because it's tipping off the who are going to
watch your broadcast they monitor me all the time as does the captivity industry who should be fighting
this battle not me that's their industry that they are not policing right or the animal welfare
industry since the captivity industry is not going to do it that's a multi-billion dollar industry
that could end that dolphin slaughter anytime they want to now in 2009 i think you said that the
industry was responsible for like two billion dollars in revenue a year for captive dolphins
that industry sea world alone makes a billion and a half a year still to this day that's just one
company you're not talking about the industry the alliance of marine parks and aquariums all over
the world it's massive yeah they can end whatever they want to they don't want to they don't want
to get involved they only get involved in things that make money not negative cash flow positive
cash flow but these guys people like these groups in taiji japan who are rounding up the dolphin
and capturing them and selling them for 100 grand a pop there haven't there been offers that you
guys have made to basically subsidize what they're making like hey we'll figure out a way to reimburse
you for all the money you're losing for selling these dolphins and that would be a fair compromise
and they basically said no we've had meetings with the mayor the city council the police the
coast guard all of them at a table like this a huge table in the city hall my wife helene and i
long before the film the cove was made and anybody cared about this issue we're in there
asking them if they would agree to take a year off we'll pay they had 13 boats that were hunting
dolphins we will pay i didn't have anybody could you pay for lunch but i'm bluffing sometimes it
works i'll find the money later so i we told them we would we'll pick we'll we'll subsidize the
boat these guys stayed up for one year and don't hunt any dolphins continue doing whatever else you
do but believe the dolphins will give you the same amount of money and that was translated around the
room and then it comes around again the answer was it's not about money it's about pest control
the other words the dolphins are eating too much fish right and
so let's kill the all the dolphins yeah that was the that was the answer whether it's true or not
i don't know it's just one person at that table two cents they're putting in but
they didn't go for the subsidize they know yeah it seems like that's just it's an excuse for
something else whether it be like that the fishing has been their lives for so long it's a it's a
lifestyle for them it's a culture for them maybe it's not it gives them meaning no it's not cultural
that's one of the they say that over and over again and in some warped way it's become the truth
the truth is it's never been ever been their culture commercial factory wailing has never
been their culture you can see the boats they still have these antique canoes where the whole
tribe would go out and and they would hunt one whale and bring it into taiji and they would live
off that whale for a long time they never hunted dolphins for dolphin shows all of that is a lie
yeah so they make up but you have to understand when i say they i'm talking about a very
small minority of men in a very remote village in taiji there's a hundred
audience pay attention there's 127 million people in japan who don't harm harm dolphins
right and they don't even know about this stuff no not really they're they're it's a small island
actually relative to california it's the same has about the same size actually that's california
but it's got 127 million people all crammed together living there and and they do it pretty well
actually but but those people don't really eat whale meat anymore the the the younger people
kind of laugh at it it's a much older people people my age i'm 84 they would continue eating
whale because that's what they grew up on during the second war after the war all of the cattle
had been bombed there wasn't any protein and they were eating it was general macarthur who told them
go out and kill whales really we the americas gave them the ship say still have to go out and hunt
whales because we bombed all the cattle and they were starving and so they did there's no need to
do that today there's plenty of you go into the supermarket in taiji katsura and these places
plenty of food they're doing it to sell to dolphin shows not even about meat that's the big lie right
if they had to depend only on the meat they would have gone out of the meat just a distraction
20 years ago or something like that are they still funneling all that meat into the school system
no that ended by exposing it sometimes exposing it as you know the way to go so
we keep doing that we keep doing that and try to keep from getting arrested on false charges and
yeah that that was bizarre some of the stories about the history of mercury poisoning in japan
like from the chizofactory and children being born deaf and blind and from the pregnant mothers
being exposed to this mercury and i think even in the documentary you guys like took a hair
sample from one of the japanese guys and you found out his the mercury level in his body was like
200 times the acceptable level or something like that yeah it's uh it's a big problem yeah um you
guys are going back there still every year right yeah we do um not as much we're we're we're we're
we're trying to get our japanese colleagues to be the face of it and step up not you guys right
yeah and replace so we can step down it's really um it's up to the japanese people to do this our
work is about facilitating that helping them do that how many operations around the world do you
think are similar to what's going on in taiji with this like as far as like like using those big
metal rods to round up the dolphin with the sound wall and then bring them into the coven slaughter
and like that salomon islands indonesia no that's in indonesia there was a few places that that
happens isn't the salomon islands near indonesia already no no okay no they're australia oh it's
australia yeah lincoln it's got a place there we and one of our board members dr sarah meltzoff
live with that tribe for many years still goes there um that is really traditional they've been
doing that for hundreds of years really yeah the same way it's been done in taiji the one in taiji
it's only been going on since the 50s they lie about that when they say we it's our tradition our
culture it is not their culture it's not their tradition it is in the salomon islands but not
in taiji yeah hunting whales in a canoe that is traditional they don't do that anymore so
they just lie about uh what they do cover it up so how do you approach the people in the
in indonesia that have been doing this for a very long time in indonesia i don't approach them at
all we don't do we we we don't um we have our colleagues who are indonesian deal with that
westerners going into places and telling people what to do it's found a good idea really uh yeah
we don't have a good track record so it's not like we said at the right hand side of god and we
have to you know the well we think we do sometimes so i don't i sympathize with it we try to we try
to get the japanese people to take ownership of this right that's what it's about right it's hard
for them to do that because you don't take sides with there's you you don't take sides with westerners
you don't do that um you don't criticize the government that's something you just don't do
in japanese culture if you get arrested and i was told i have friends in japan who i've known for
40 50 years that's how long i've been involved in the japanese thing and they told me early on
if i get arrested they are breaking all contact with me
and that's what they do uh if you get arrested even if it's for the right reason and by the way
i have been arrested many times how many i couldn't count it but every time is by my design right
every time right except when i was it was never an accident well in japan it was deliberate
uh i mean i i i it wasn't by my design they arrested me on false charges i had no control
of it oh really yeah but i took in the court and won so they don't do that anymore what was the
false what was the false charge uh let's see well the first time i was arrested
i had just arrived in taiji i was jet lagged i arrived in tokyo got on the train by the time
you get to taiji you're exhausted and i got to taiji got off the train walked to a restaurant
and it was opening day of the dolphin hunt september first so a lot of japanese journalists
are there these journalists are all we call them the mayor's pet journalists he brings them in
to write the story he wants written and so they plotted against me propaganda well they yeah they
told uh they saw me drinking a beer in the restaurant i had a half a glass of i don't really i don't
really drink but i had a half a glass and then i left the gun in the car and i was driving to the
hotel which is like five minutes away you can almost throw a rock to it a couple of cop cars were
parked waiting for me they pulled me over gave me a breathalyzer test and i passed
now there's dozens of people and all the photographers all of the the media japanese
media were there they're the ones who called the police on me but it's a very serious crime in
japan drinking and driving they don't they do not tolerate it one strike and you are out oh wow
and so i passed the test i'm fine and they said let's see your driver's license
no my passport i couldn't find my passport i said it's in the hotel we're parked in the parking
lot of the hotel i said i'll go up there and get it for you right no you're under arrest for not
carrying your passport and so i went to jail that night and they found my passport it was actually
golf compartment of the car i was in they had to let me go that was the first arrest the second one
was i was going through september first again season just starting and whenever i go through
immigration as soon as they put my passport in the computer the red light goes off in the bells and
every time yeah and people behind me are getting out of line going okay it happens every time and
they take me to the back room which i'm very familiar with i lay down on the bench and usually
try to sleep because they tie me up for hours doing this they tie you oh yeah not literally
not literally they want me to miss my baggage and all that stuff right right so you just get
comfortable because you're used to yeah i can usually fall asleep and they always let me go
this time they did this time they put me in a cell down in the basement with several other
people trying to get into the country wow a fishing community a small group of those in
tokyo this is in tokyo still this all stems from this small fishing village yeah it goes so far up
the chain yeah yeah so they uh so they really care about this in japan like it's it it's up in the
higher levels of the government if we can shut this down they're thinking this little thing this
little co we could probably shut down whaley maybe that's what they're thinking i don't know what
they're thinking for all the same reasons i don't know what you're thinking but i i assume that's
what they're why they're so spending so much money and time and energy on making sure that they can
continue doing this and they're winning so far it takes money to stop it you cannot this is a war
this is a full blown war but yeah you cannot fight a war without ammunition but i've been doing that
the dolphin project has been doing that since 2003 if i had a fraction of the money that the cost
make the makov movie i could end this thing if i had a fraction of the money that comes in you go to
the 10 top animal well go ahead sorry no no i was going to say if you said fracture of the money how
like how if you if okay like what we're doing we're hiring lawyers right looking for illegalities
taking out full page advertisement in educational material in magazines billboards there's a lot
of things you can do if you have money right i never had that i wasn't working for the dolphin
project because i i had to leave and go get a paying job somewhere i went to work for earth island
institute environmental group and uh i i ended up resigning because they were totally ineffective
and like most of these big groups what they're looking for is uh issues like this that they
can attach themselves to and ask for donations and those donations you can see them if you go to the
10 top groups animal welfare groups they have to publish their taxes we publish ours right
the first the biggest one they have 300 million dollars sitting in a thing called reserve in
other words they have enough money to do everything they're doing plus their retirement
but they just have this extra and there's 10 or 20 groups like this there's hundreds of millions of
they have they have 300 million in reserve why am i there doing this when they could be doing it
right i don't have the money to fight this war we didn't even have a budget i had a credit card
from earth island i could buy airplane tickets and food and hotels but no money to fight the
fucking war right i resigned and i know they have it i can look you can see their tax records 30
million dollars or something so i've got become very disgusted and disillusioned with the animal
welfare industry and the environmental industry all these big groups i realized if we cannot fix
that problem that cove isn't much bigger than the orange ball than a football field if we can't
fix that what and they're working on these big projects to save the world to save the ocean
save it if you can't fix that how are you going to fix the bigger things and they can't fix it
because they don't even try so it it it it it's very depressing and it will lead you to a place
that you don't want to go and that's where i have been on this dolphin trail having to fight
this war with no ammunition realizing ammunition's there you just it's kind of like in Gaza the food
is sitting right outside the gate but they won't let the food in it's one of those right there's
no need to fix that problem in tai chi it's not that big but nobody works on nobody does anything
about it except sign this petition and send us money that's the problem we don't have the money
to fight this war and the people who have it are out looking for other opportunities they're not
actually spending the money on the war everybody is missing in action so i've never said these things
stay away from these podcasts and stuff like that but i think this will be in
Lincoln's movie the truth about what is going on who are the biggest customers for the Japanese
fishermen in tai chi who who who what countries what organizations are still going there at
you know atlantis in bombas well they have one in dubai that's even bigger than that and they have
yeah they have uh when they opened up they had celebrities flowing from all over the world
everybody who was uh and and those dolphins came from tai chi so what's going on here i
thought we were all against this what about seaworld or they came from those came from this
from solemn islands same thing another drive so they so so seaworld is still purchasing
dolphins from the solemn islands no they're not coming into the united states anymore we've stopped
that none of them could they no they're not they're they're having to do with captive breeding
so they have this is true in europe also most of the captive dolphins are actually
oh thanks steve for giving me a geography lesson
but it's close to indo
kind of uh same part of the world yeah this is the largest indonesia largest archipelago of
islands in the world and uh and that's where lincoln lives now yeah where we have a sanctuary
there that's the only one in the world yeah how do you confiscate a dolphin what is the process of
confiscating a dolphin in indonesia it's very different than it is in america and europe in
america and europe um you have the well in america we have the national marine fishery
service they're in charge of all things dolphin whale and you need their permission to do whatever
you're doing and um in indonesia it's the forest department the forest department are is in charge
they own literally own all wildlife so they can march in and take them away if they want to
you can't do that at seaworld that's somebody's property you'll get sued
any more than they can come in here and take your camera away so it's your property but in
indonesia it's very different that's why we're having success over there the minister is also the
minister of fisheries she's the minister of fisheries and uh and um the forest department so we also
rescue turtles and monkeys and you know in between all the other stuff we're doing so when
they confiscate something they give them to us they call us and ask us to help them and we have
to pay for it they have no they have no money no budget right now if there's a dolphin in captivity
how do you reacclimate it or reconnect it back to the environment isn't that isn't that is that
process always successful no it's uh i've written protocol and i'll send it to you so you can put
it on your thing and people can read it okay several pages long we're still writing it after
30 years because we're still learning how to do this this is pioneer work and we don't have all
the answers and you only learned from your mistakes not from your successes so we've
learned a lot because we've had mistakes also in the last 40 50 years
uh what was your original question uh how do you do it i was basically like asking like
does it is it always like does it fail sometime like what happens if you have a dolphin who's
been in captivity for 10 years and you you cat you rescue it you bring it you bring it to your
c-pen try to try to reacclimate it to the wild free willies a good example yes keiko
uh that was a brilliant rescue they rescued keiko from a swimming pool in mexico
this particular animal should never have been put in a subtropical climate like that
same is true with uh the orcas at sea world and the miami sea aquarium in these places
these are cold water animals they don't care about that they tropical animals a dolphin
research center down in the florida he captured dolphins in pine island florida sent them to
finland where it's freezing cold and to canary islands which is tropical at least but uh
yeah sending them to um so so so here was a uh an orca by the name of keiko in a swimming pool
in mexico and um i was working for earth island institute at the time they rescued keiko from
the swimming pool built a tank on the west coast and got rid of the papilloma virus that
you see on his skin uh and then moved him from there to iceland where he came from to a fjord
i think they had about 20 million dollars to work with wow yeah 21 or 22 million dollars
it's a lot of money for one animal to be released but yeah why so much money well what do you spend
20 million dollars on salaries six figure salary yeah right exactly so when i was like the homeless
problem in l.a when we we did a little bit when we do this rescue work we try to make sure i and
i've done this in guatemala same thing they did here in guatemala nigaragua columbia brazil hayty
south korea and indonesia and i always try to keep it down to 30 000 dollars trying to prove
it is more cost effective to rehabilitate them and let them go than to keep them and warehouse them
for the rest of the life but when you hire these guys from seaworld for example the last two dolphins
they were released in turkey for the born free foundation that cost almost a million dollars
for two dolphins jesus sometimes when we do it it doesn't cost the first ones we did cost 600
dollars from mash the island on kibis gain we flew them to the bahamas to exactly 2505 north
7640 west and there was a group of dolphins we could see from the chalk sea plane and we
landed on the water and let them go there that cost us that cost us six hundred dollars not 200
million or not 800 thousand you just landed the sea plane right on a school of dolphins you let
them free right there well not on the not on top of them but yeah i mean like right next yeah
but does that does that work does the dolphins let them in isn't that immediately and and they may
not that so that there are some unknowns they can be accepted sometimes they don't want to be like
valdimir there are many dolphins that are they call fredleys this episode of the podcast is brought
to you by bubs bubs naturals is a badass company that has collagen peptides it has coffee creamer
has coffee electrolytes and they are amazing because they are a tribute company to a navy seal
and former cia contractor glenn bubs dority who died defending american freedom in vengasi libya
again there is obviously no shortage of collagen products available on the internet but i support
bubs because it is not only a superior product but they support american veterans by donating 10
percent of all their proceeds to veteran organizations and a hundred percent of their
proceeds on veterans day bubs collagen peptide packets are easy to use as a daily supplement i
keep them in my truck and i drink them on the way to the gym it's flavorless easy to mix nature
it makes it easy to mix into anything i prefer mixing it in coffee you may not know but after
the age of 25 your natural production of collagen starts to fade which can severely impact your
skin and an interesting thing about collagen is the more you supplement with it the more your
natural production increases since i started using it a few months ago i've already noticed a huge
improvement in my joint connective tissues my skin elasticity and the overall quality of my hair

they chose to be alone they're comfortable being alone i'm kind of like that myself actually so i
can relate um yeah what were we talking about talking about the money it costs to treat these
animals back into the wild yeah it depends on who you hire to do it if you hire a bunch of
these sea world people they'll stretch it out as long as they can and make as much money so that's
what happened after several years trying to free willy the 20 million ran out and they all left
where did they go they went to Panama now you would think the dolphin trainers who worked on
the free willy project would be so proud of this play that and they know now that captivity is wrong
these are all orchid trainers from sea world right that have left the industry and now they've
they've got this project to free willy behind under their belt and you think they would be
the the new guys who take over this captivity issue and run with it but instead they ran to
Panama they bought more land than sea world has in Orlando and they were going to out do sea world
by building a new one in Panama they applied for a permit to capture i don't know 20 often something
like that as soon as we heard about it we went there and organized protests and these were huge
process the pandemines were outraged you're trying to capture our dolphins all you guys from free willy
and the protests were very successful and they we actually ran them out of town
where did they go these trainers from free willy yeah they went to the Solomon Islands
stopping they're trapping dolphins from Solomon Islands to Mexico to Singapore to the Philippines
and other places
people don't know these things they they they only know what you know i i start to question
about history i i see how history is rewritten all the time by and i start to question what's real
and what isn't right i know what you mean so keiko why sir finally finally it was very obvious
at some point if you ever worked with a orca in captivity and i did and so did these guys
if you've ever done that you know that keiko at some point after the 20 million that was gone
and they were gone that
this animal is not a candidate to be released but since they were all gone now the money's
gone nobody's on the payroll except hs us and and and uh earth island institute that's basically
two people based two people are making the decision and their decision is freedom at all cost
although he's not a candidate and i was watching this
it was more about optics he died right and
and we will never know why he died what kind of shape he was in because they buried him in a
secret location as quickly as possible with no necropsy with when i heard they they didn't
do a necropsy that the captivity industry they do that only because they don't want you to know
why they died right soon as they did this i went right to the guy and i asked him
how come you didn't do a necropsy see they're spinning the story now and everybody who donated
20 million bucks believing a bunch of bullshit they can spin it any way they want right why
why is the dorsal spin finned curved over like that there are theories um mine is that uh it has
to do with gravity in the wild they will spend 80 of their time underwater where there is no
gravity the captivity they're always looking for food looking for a handout right and gravity i believe
has a lot to do with that okay you know that white the white stuff all over her skin that was the
papilloma that's from being in in the cold water animal in mexico come on
okay go dice why did he die now they'll have some vet prostitute vet come out there and
give you some fucking story that's not true and i get in trouble with all these people because
uh i out them what is your
what is your theory or what do you believe about why a couple of those trainers were killed by the
by the orcas like dragged down and drowned by the orcas why why do you think that that
anger frustration really anger no question about it one day i got a call from a guy i forget his name
he was the president of the california trial lawyers association he's representing a sea world
trainer by the name of john silik who was uh writing on the back of an orca on the surface
of the water during a show he's actually writing backwards he's facing backwards on them so he's
showing you the video mm-hmm another orca leaps up and deliberately lands right on it breaking
most of the bones in her body and really oh my god so this guy uh flew me out to california and
showed me this and it wanted me to be well i was so there's video of it yeah that's it right there
play that you see he he's facing backwards okay i see this is deliberate does that not work steve oh
so he needs an eyewitness video who actually trained orcas uh to say that because there are
millions so he could sue sea world so they're going to sue their that's a done deal okay how much is
how much right 100 million bucks or what here's don't this is another lady her name was um
so anyhow let me go back to they're going to show the video this guy getting slammed i think
oh wow oh here got here comes
he's writing on the dorsal fin going backwards and he deliberately did that see that oh my lord
so this guy said will you testify that in court i said yeah i will if you agree to go to court
because historically this is not the first time there are many of these and they always
settle out of court right right kept quiet and that's why this guy got hurt because the last lawyer
didn't take it to court didn't make it public kept quiet take it to trial don't take the settlement
and he said i promise you i'm not taking a settlement we don't want to see this to happen to
and he was lying to me and of course he took the settlement he settled and for a lot of money
john solock bought a nightclub in san diego this guy yeah he survived but the next accident
there was another one don't branch out after that because because he didn't take it to court
right and there was a girl there was a woman that right after before that and um she was in
Vancouver and orca pulled her into water and killed her kelty brinders her name she
she would be alive today if that guy didn't lie to me and said let's go to court
that's what they do and sea world pays them because they have they make a what do they care
about a hundred february 2024 and in february 2010 telecom killed don branch off branch off
a 40 year old sea world trainer branch i was killed following a dine with shan mu world the
veteran trainer was rubbing telecom as part of the post show routine when the orca grabbed her
by her ponytail oh by her ponytail and pulled her in the water what whatever happened with
telecom after that well that that that's a lie right there that you're you're reading early stuff
that it's wikipedia of course turned out that sea world spun it as her fault she should never
have the ponytail right we tell people don't do it that's just spin that's not true right
so what happened with telecom after that happened did they did they decommission her
they put him in a him isolation in a small tank till he died
god really tiny little tank they punished him how long did it take him to die i don't know i'd
have to go back and research that right so so now to you what you were saying earlier is because
they that we're the us no longer imports wales or dolphins right from anywhere around the world
and this is no no they could import they can import them they can't i don't have the laws here
in front of me there's lots of different laws but they can get them if they want them they
can't capture them they just do it secretly probably like it's frowned upon so they just
try to keep it out of the limelight they have they have loopholes like uh breeding alone
it's a breeding alone like like canary islands all of the orcas there there's uh there they're
actually owned by sea world they're not owned by canary island so what is called um laura park
canary islands my wife goes there quite a bit monitoring those whales but um
they're actually from sea world they call it a breeding alone but they never come back
so they get their stock they get the sperm delivered every month you know they masturbate
them take the sperm and kept the breeding now the thing is these animals uh at you asked about um
um sea world or the one here what is it called uh clear water marine yeah the clear water
marine the way the law reads really you're not supposed to have dolphins in captivity unless
it's an educational experience right so that's the loophole they pretend this and it is an
educational experience but it is a negative educational experience it's a form of bad education
so they just take advantage of the fact that our system the way it's set up the lobbyists
lead and the politicians follow and they get whatever they want they have carte blanche
because the system doesn't work you take the national marine fisheries and aphis these agencies
that are protecting every all dolphins are under their care but who is above them they're a branch
of the department of commerce look at that word commerce right they don't protect them at all that's
not their job their job is to regulate in other words if you want to send dolphins to europe
capture them at pine island florida they were rubber stamping them 98.4 percent of all permits
to capture dolphins and exploit them any way you want to was approved by the commerce department
right in all these agencies work below the whole thing is about money and the agencies the national
the government how do they profit from it it's a multi-billion dollar industry they pay taxes
just like you and me where does that money go it goes to the government the reason i learned about
you was in it was i think around 2009 2010 i uh was working on that dolphin tale movie that was
filmed at the clearwater marine aquarium and that's where i met pete sugerini who is the underwater
legendary amazing underwater cinematographer who filmed all the pirates of the caribbean movies
and he helped linkin film the blood dolphin show he told me all about this story and linkin you know
i came to like understand that's when i first discovered like the polarization in this in this
world and you know there's a lot of people like i think jack hann is one of the people you debated
about this on tv a long time ago that say like if you if you take a place like the clearwater
marine aquarium who it has people dolphins like winter who was caught up in a crab trap and the
rope basically mangled her tail they had to amputate her tail they kept her alive is is there
anything to say about aquariums like that that are keeping animals that are injured that need to
be rehabilitated who would have died the other way or like it would have been if they would have
stayed in the wild they would have died yeah and what they're telling you about them rescuing that
animal and doing whatever they did they were absolutely correct
that's good work they do that better than anybody else in the world because
these are dolphin traffickers they know how to transport them and move them around and have the
veterinarians and people who are trained in marine mammal husbandry and whenever i'm debating with
them maybe you've seen some of the big they bring that up immediately and say this is what we do
that's not what they do that's what they do five percent of the time and they do it better than
anybody and that's what clearwater should be that a rescue center outdoors where the dolphins can
experience the natural rhythms of the sea and the tide and the current see the sky all of these
elements are very important in the healing process right you can't do that inside of the building
the reason they're in the building and that's what i'm up to that set about spending 40 million
dollars for another tank in building instead of revolutionizing the concept and by the way
that's what we're trying to do we're not trying to abolish that industry we're trying to revolutionize
it make the five percent the 95 percent and forget about the five percent which is just
stupid dolphin tricks yeah i guess the question is like where does all the money go right because
they spent all that money to rebuild that aquarium and build those giant they got rid of those round
wastewater tanks and they built really big tanks for those things and they
obviously show tanks they're show tanks right for shows and obviously the movie
was a huge marketing tool for that aquarium really they drew people from all over the world to come
visit clearwater to come see that aquarium and that didn't just benefit the aquarium that benefited
the city of clear water it benefited all the tourism around here which you know a majority of
the economy around here is based on tourism yeah um so you know what's to say that's that money
can't go towards revolutionizing this and building more awareness towards these dolphins and and
their intelligence and helping and and using that money to to rescue more animals rehabilitate
more animals whether they can be released because i don't know i think they do release some animals
that they do they do work in that rescue and release but but they'll tell you themselves
the ones that they want to keep they do manatees the manatees they have don't have scar they're
looking for dolphins without scars and and they'll go into their collection because they'll make sure
this authorities understand they can't be released i mean so how how did the the whole flipper tv
series come about what were you doing how old were you where were you living and how are you
approached to be a part of this the flipper movie uh which eventually became a series
well my first uh okay a little scoot in a little bit yeah my first my first uh encounter with that
whole thing i guess would be uh on christmas day 1955 i had uh just come home from a 14 day leave
from the navy i just gotten through boot camp and when you get out of navy boot camp before you
get shipped out to sea you have a 14 day leave so i was home on that 14 day leave my abc quarry
just opened i went there with my family i'm in uniform i'm standing there in front of this big
glass window looking into this half a million gallon tank
and by the way this was the third dolphinarium in the world at this point in 1955 it was not a
multi-billion dollar industry it's the only the third one in the world first one opened in
st august 1938 and then uh in los angeles palace verdes california opened up in 1954
something like that so this one just opened and i stood there at the window the glass window looking
in and it was just blew me away there were sharks there were 500 pound grouper turtles the size of
this table uh slithering along the bottom that'd be big giant sawfish slithering around moray eels
and now here comes a guy walking across the tank just jumping over the rocks and stuff
got a canvas suit on spun copper miller done helmet and uh air flowing out of the helmet
to the surface and i can see that light coming through the water and there's a hose going up
to the surface and the dolphins and everything is surrounding this guy who's passing out fish
to everybody and i thought man when i get out of the navy i'm going to come back here and get that
guy's job five years later i did that's how i started wow i applied for a job as a diver
i graduated from divers training academy of the first class deep-sea diver and uh i was
been diving all over the Mediterranean Caribbean what were you doing for the in the navy like what
kind of missions were you on or what kind of i was on an anti-submarine hunter killer group for
the last two years on a destroyer in the uh penetrated and we'd go to gitmo bank
for a gunnery practice every year we'd go to uh dorsi play war games with the submarines we'd be
anchored in monaco for example and have three submarines we'd all swing on the same anchor
i wanted to continue diving so when i got out of the navy i went to work for arthur mckay
who was a treasure diver he was the world's foremost treasured i'm a family friend
i did that for a couple of years and it was the hardest work i ever did in my life
and i never found the gold bars that i fantasized i was about to get married or i thought i was
going to and i told captain mckay i've got to get a real job he took me to this aquarium
to his friend captain bill gray who was in charge of everything he's the guy who started this whole
industry actually he hired me on the spot and i'm doing that job that i explained to you the
feeding the fish and the and you get promoted as you you know spend your time there i was promoted
to doing this top deck show i wasn't actually a dolphin trainer but my pay grade and my uh
uh my job uh description was a dolphin trainer although i never trained a dolphin anybody
could actually step out there at showtime the dolphins know three times a day they're doing
this routine and you could put a mannequin out there passing out fish and they would do the
so it looked like i was a dolphin trainer but i really had never trained a dolphin i went there
to be a diver that's what i wanted to do my by the way my first day on the job i was assigned the
diver's diving job on the capture boat and we were capturing dolphins at that time every day
for i don't know a few months for the world's fair in new york for new dolphin areas that were
opening up in europe we were selling them i remember loading a dolphin you could buy a dolphin from
the boat from the sea aquarium boat for three hundred dollars or 350 if you wanted a particular
sex size and sex they called it if you wanted a female six feet long that was 350 300 for just
in the fifties and i remember loading a dolphin into the station wagon of a guy who drove here
to saint pete beach to give it to his girlfriend for her birthday there were no laws protecting
dolphins and finally there was a 1972 marine mammal protection act which they could have called
marine mammal park protection act because that's who they protect the corporations not the animals
but uh wow that that just that reminds me i don't know if you're aware of there used to be a
bar a little shitty dive bar literally like two miles from here that should have been shut down
for a year probably 10 years now it was called the porpoise pub it was a bar and in the in the
middle of the bars in the middle like it was a big circular bar in the middle there was a big
round fish tank and they had dolphins in there people would go and buy shots and drink beers and
watch the dolphins swim around in this little tank i may have captured those dolphins you could buy
them then for 350 300 350 bucks uh but to answer your question that's how i started and then
then the flipper movie was made the very first movie with chuck connors and luke halpin and it
was very very successful some scenes were shot at the sea quarry with sharks and i was involved in
shark wrangling and all of that for that first movie then they came back and made a deal with the
sea quarry to do a tv series they had the green light to do a series it's going to start off with a
pilot feature first called flippers new adventure the deal was the sea quarry would supply um
the dolphins and a trainer and we're going to be training underwater it's never been done before
historically dolphins are trained topside you come in buy a ticket you sit down and they're doing
tricks on the surface of the water so this was all new i was chosen uh as that diver trader
i was the trader i was making 85 dollars a week as a diver and when i got promoted to
trainer i was making 95 and then flipper came along in a short period of time i'm the highest
paid admiral trader in the world i'm buying a new Porsche every year and riko my the director said
don't buy anything don't buy anything you can't pay for in 13 weeks he had been down this road
before you know so the sea quarry had a supply uh a dolphin and five dolphins actually and we
decided on females they decided on females i wasn't really in the decision-making
role at that point we'll get five they decided because uh we don't know what we're doing this
has never been done before we don't know how many we're going to need and you capture them in
bis game bay i had already captured them okay in bis game bay right when i was on the boat so they
were already on the grounds in in holding tanks somewhere on the grounds okay we didn't have to
go get them we we had them ready for whoever wanted to buy them or in this case they were given to them
so that was the deal they were going to uh and uh so i'm just thinking back here
what's your original question am i drifting too far no no no no you're we're just going like through
the linear linear story of how the flipper show came about okay so i was uh there was a guy when
i was doing the show i i'm remembering these things so i'm not giving you the chronology
exactly but uh when i was doing the show and i was promoted to trainer and uh i'm all over the
ground you know walking around and i there was one guy working with a dolphin back that
was riko browning and i would go help him riko was the creature from the black lagoon right the guy
who directed most of the underwater for sea hunt ballo buran the aquanauts all those fifties black
and white shoes right and uh he became my best friend uh he was a diver stuntman took me under
his wing and he was my mentor uh he wanted to be a director at that point he was just putting
this show together he was the creator of flipper he had written the book he had his brother law jack
called flipper and he told me it was not as a refrigerator for about 10 years
they finally gave it to ivan tours who the dalas knew this and they did it was a huge success all
over the world this episode of the podcast is brought to you by verso have you ever tried
fasting or intermittent fasting if so you may be aware of the sizzling energy and mental clarity
that you get if you do it long enough the scientific data validating the health benefits from fasting
for weight loss is overwhelming but what doesn't get talked about enough is the longevity benefits
you get from fasting when you fast your body turns on all its defense mechanisms to help your body
hunker down to fight off illness and disease but the problem is it takes three days of starving
yourself to activate this process scientists like david sinclair have recently discovered
molecules to help your body turn on this process without having to fast if you've ever heard this
podcast before you've heard me talk about verso many times and i've had world-renowned nutritional
scientists like dominic dagustino on the show who is the guy who actually introduced me to verso
and i've been taking it every day for the last three years cell being is always the first thing
i take in the morning after dragging my carcass into the kitchen which wakes me up and gives me
energy i even use it for pre-workout and clean being is the product i use every night before bed
after taking clean being for some time now i have actually noticed a huge improvement in
not only my hormone regulation but my vision has improved i know it sounds insane but this stuff
actually can improve your vision my lipid regulation has gotten better and another huge thing is
all of a sudden i don't get affected by all the pollen in the air i don't have any of these reactions
and clean being has actually been scientifically proven to alleviate these things other clinical
trials have proven healthier skin less inflammation healthier hair lipid regulation enhanced cognitive
function and improved metabolism on top of that verso always publishes third-party testing on each

uh living with these flipper dolphins seven days a week 24 hours a day for seven seven years or
something like that and when you do that it's very different than the job i had before where
you go into the morning you do three shows you got the weekends off and it's like an eight
to five job for most dolphin trainers they don't really live with the dolphins if they did they would
probably be doing what i'm doing because that's when you really get to know them when you're living
with them like that how so it's like uh do you have any pets at home i have a dog i've had a dog
for the last uh 14 years he actually just died two days ago okay it's right there what's the dog's
name my friend julien got me this cool little crystal julien dory shout out to him he got me
this this 3d crystal of my dog oh well looks like a fox teacup yorkie yeah he looks like a little
fox yorkie his name is dunk so if you were to uh what's his name is dunk dunk if you if you had
interacted with dunk uh a few times a day you know five days a week or something it's not the same
relationship when you're living with him you can anticipate when he gets up and walks across the
room what he's going to do after 14 right right that's that's what i'm talking about i don't know
how to express that but you get to know them like that okay whereas dolphin trainers never really
get to they have a utilitarian relationship with right the animals right they don't really get to
know them right um so that that that's that's that's i don't know where to
where to go from there that's where that's that's where it all began so you you lived
literally right next to the lake where they filmed right like you lived in the house that was that's
in my house i also had a house trailer near so there is a fenced in area there
public's not allowed employees though i had the i i would lock it i had i was back there just me
in the dolphins for years i became very reclusive i'm still very reclusive um
it was during a time when uh there was a lot of turmoil the vietnam war was raging right
now america was divided not as much as we are today but divided because of that war
protesting going on all over the place i became one of those people who started
doing a lot of soul searching back there and uh questioning what i'm doing it was a
um it was a very strange duality i was living my my my work my job and my life but what i'm doing
there is trying to get the trust i'm trying to get their trust and i accomplished that of course
if you spend it i sleep on the dock with them i mean i'm really i call dolphin time
and uh did you have any sort was there a special way you could communicate with the dolphins
would you always silence it's all in silence at that time i was actually being silent for i
was studying it but the nindian guru who's silent for i think 26 years and i was doing this i was
living in a world of silence with them um a lot of the time i had to interact i didn't have to
interact with anybody i would drive my portion to the back and lock the gate and they stay away
from me the trucks would come to film what's in a blue moon after the first couple years they had
so much stock footage they left me i was there alone all this time right with my surfboard my
little boat the dolphins and my and my friends i was living a coconut grove and
you know it was it was during a time when it was during a time when coconut grove was
it was an art colony and some of the uh john sebastian who you just saw remember a band
called the love and spoonful you don't remember that with god i'm not getting old
yeah that's why everybody in the world knew before my time rick do you believe in me oh of
course yes john okay when you see the poster for woodstock there's a guy you see the audience you
see a guy's wearing tie-dye clothes that's john oh okay so these him and all his friends fred
neil who wrote everybody's talk of did they cowboy won the academy award he was my best friend actually
he and i started doing musical experiments back there because nobody was there and we
could do this communication okay let's uh that's a language too and we're back there
go with our guitars and sometimes cast alley it would come uh you remember them the mom and
the pop is you'd have to sing it's all for me i don't remember my name but i've probably heard
their music oh you have california dreaming oh of course yes yeah so sometimes cast within
denny were there cross me was always there david cross me steven stills actually put the first money
into it uh joni michael joni and and and cross me lived in the garage next door to me i lived in
one house they were there john lived in another one tennessee williams lived at the end of the
street so all these celebrities started coming out at night and we're doing timothy leary jack
timothy leary timothy leary uh so you're taking lsd sorry you guys were taking lsd
well no i wouldn't say well are you are you asking me if timothy leary was taking lsd
i'm saying were you guys all were you guys all taking lsd and hanging out making music with the
dolphins no and i'm trying to be real careful not to create that image in your mind in those days
i did i did myself i never gave it to the dolphins but i did experiment with it
it was perfectly legal at the time even if it wasn't i still would have experimented but i
wanted to give you an idea of what the rest of the world was thinking about lsd they weren't
thinking about it was nobody even knew what it was no one cared but tim came to um
coca de grove once when he had a cardboard box full of lsd 25 he called it uh from the
sand dose laboratory in switzerland perfectly legal nobody knew what this was it was just a
new thing right and john lily do you know who he is of course yes so john had his he lived across
the street from me no way yeah lincoln just filmed all of this i've explained it to you in
coca de grove and so pull up john lily's bio on there so jump in uh let me see
so yeah to answer your question no nobody yeah there's john right there
yeah he he invented yeah he's the guy who invented the isolation tank the sense the sensory
deprivation tank yeah and i used that one in his his house in malibu he was living in malibu
when i stayed there i would stay in that room that had the isolation tank and he was he was obsessed
with communicating with dolphins obsessed he was uh he had a grant from nasa to try to communicate
to try to communicate with a non-human intelligence because they were going to the moon they were sure
at some point we're going to run into some non-human intelligence and we need a code to
communicate john got a grant from them i probably captured those dolphins as well because we were
selling them to whoever at the sea quarry he was in coca de grove in the old bank building
the early bank building had uh three or four of these uh portable swimming pools you see in
people's backyards they were inside the bank the bank had been closed for years and he had
dolphins in there and yeah he was trying to no not with the music he was taking their skull cap off
and putting wires into their brains and doing all of this kind of wow very very intrusive
uh and most of them were dying at that point when he was doing that nobody knew that dolphins
were automatic that were they were not automatic air breathers like us if if you give me a sedative
i will go to sleep i'll keep breathing if you do that with the dolphin they die every breath
is a conscious effort how do they sleep they don't like we do they they rest they switch
different hemispheres of the brain back and forth and rest but they don't sleep every breath is a
conscious effort they're never fully unconscious no not really i don't believe so nobody would be
able to know that but i don't think they i think they're always awake whoa so he had written
two or three books that i was reading back there and i was taking sides with him he was saying
dolphins are more intelligent than humans it shocked the scientific community for a
science for a brain surgeon to be saying this um
in what way were they more intelligent well that's the thing uh he's saying they're more
intelligent because well first of all just evolution they have been here 65 million years
let's just say as a graph it's the size of this table the length this is 65 million years
we have been here about on the two inch line right so if you a blip a blip on the timeline
if you assume that the brain is more than excess baggage we're carrying on this trip
through time and space the porcelain is on and somebody is home and that's not only dolphins
look at the look at the look at the look at the uh sperm whale and one third of its body is his head
it's the largest brain on the planet how big is the sperm whale's brain it's on average
you know like the weight or the dimensions of it like the size of this table wow well you can see
you can see that there's a good picture yeah it's a third of his body yeah it's like the first
time I read Charles Darwin there was a voyage of the beagle he had gone from England to to uh
the Galapagos Islands and he wrote it creates a sense of wonder that so much beauty was so
evidently created for so little purpose it's kind of like that with this brain why does this
how did this evolve after 65 million years to for no so little purpose right it has a purpose
we just don't know what it is it can't manipulate its environment like we can going back to your
question what makes them more intelligent yeah this is what John was his hypothesis
all of the senses are better
hmm so I started uh reading as much as I could and exploring and I'm back there living with
them and I started to go up a little bit what is that giant yellow thing in the front of his
face maybe some sensory organ that is that a sensory organ yeah that big yellow thing
sperm whale's had the largest brain of all living organisms holy crap that's wild
well dolphin brains are like the same size if not bigger than ours just regular
bigger than ours right bigger yeah so this is these are the things and I'm starting to believe
this and at the same time I'm being paid by this aquarium I'm part of this fucking circus
and I started rebelling against it but now my friends are coming out trying that thing a little
bit towards you at night and we're doing music and trying to experiment with it it looked pretty
weird to the sea aquarium because there were no long-haired people at those days except my friends
coming in at night and you know so yeah it's interesting that that these animals have been
around for so long 65 million years and we've only been here for a couple hundred thousand years
but we are so intelligent relative I mean maybe they're more intelligent but we're it's really
close it and there's a lot are you aware of the the stoned ape hypothesis how like there well
there's multiple different theories on how we are brains evolved right because there's quite a
gap there's nothing like us on earth there's nothing there's a massive gap between us and the
next primate right it's like yeah there's why is there such a big gap at the evolutionary gap
between us you know what I mean and how did we come up how do we just pop up out of nowhere
this intelligent animal that can manipulate its environment and build all these crazy things and
create artificial intelligence have you been watching uh ancient aliens I have not watched
ancient aliens you have to watch that everybody has to watch that because they're actually showing
you the answer your question they talk about what I know there's like a bunch of ideas one of them
is panspermia to how you know there's rocks that hit that come from other yeah other solar systems
and they they they hit our earth they hit the earth and they contain microorganisms from other
galaxies or whatever and that could have somehow fueled our evolution or like change something
within us and made us pop out of nowhere right that's what their hypothesis yes yes they're
saying this we are actually an experiment yes that's one of the ideas the other one is a monkey
at a mushroom and then our brains jumped 10 times the size yeah so who knows you know but
so John Lilly his experiment uh cutting the skull caps off the dolphins and putting electrodes in
their brains what did he say his his the results of those experiments were did did he got off track
he got he got off track with drugs with last time I saw John I was staying at his house in Malibu
he was so far I don't want to say gone maybe he's the only one who's but he's he's communicating
with aliens at this point oh really it's not about it's not about do they exist he's actually
in touch with him oh he that's what he said to you oh he doesn't say it to me he's just
do he just does it he he I couldn't understand him when I first met him in coconut grove
and he came out to the sea aquarium he was very straight I'll use that word a white doctor coat
with a tie short haircut and scientist scientist after Tim leary left he was a different person
now he's freeing the dolphins from the coconut grove bank and putting them in bisque bay letting
them go the last dolphin he had two of them there were their names are Joe and Rosie named after
Joseph E. Levine and his wife Rosalie who made the movie day of the dolphin he made a lot of
movies Joseph E. Levine but John agreed that when they were captured when he's through doing his
human dolphin communications work he was set them free and they were stuck at the dolphin
research center down in the Florida Keys for about four or five years the promise just went
undone and a group of people got together they hired me we moved the dolphins by helicopter
Lincoln was with us he's about three feet tall flew up to Georgia to the National Geographic
documented this and uh I think it was the very first explorer series but they they we rehabilitated
the dolphins and set them free wow and that's the last uh he did with dolphins before he died have
you there's this uh we were just talking about this on a podcast the other day there is a a new
artificial intelligence company or it's an organization that's developing
it's called interspecies IO and they're using artificial intelligence to communicate with
dolphins and to other species so what they're doing is they're using artificial intelligence to
record like you record the sounds these animals make and it's supposed to be able to decipher it
so we can understand what they're saying so essentially using AI to communicate with animals
and understand and communicate possibly communicate back with them it's bizarre yeah this is it right
here it's a think tank an artificial intelligence think tank and it goes back to um what uh John
Lily was doing you know that's it's it's all about understanding non-human intelligence
anyway so okay so um you guys were spending time trying to you know you were playing music you were
communicating with the animals you were spending a lot of time with the animals and this sort of
catapulted your this sort of like sent you for a loop and it changed you and it made you
well at what point was it during flipper or what maybe maybe it was after flipper that
you know it was before it was before it ended long before like the second year i i i knew
i mean it's real obvious dolphins do not belong in captivity it's very black and white when
you're living with it like this but i didn't do anything about it was it the death of uh
that was it yeah so it was an act of passion that forced that there was an automatic organic
reaction to her suicide you mentioned earlier they are self-aware yes um that every breath
is a conscious effort um and that's what she died from self-induced asphyxiation
not every breath they take is a conscious effort right right if you don't take the next breath
you're going to that self-induced asphyxiation and that's what i witnessed and i have seen that
over and over again at the cove in tai g where they're driven in if you don't know how to read
their body language you wouldn't see what i see when i go to a place where dolphins are i see i
don't see the same thing i see what's really going on and i see dolphins being driven in
visually you're only seeing them on the surface but i've spent so much time with them underwater i
know what's going on underwater when they're being driven in when they're being driven into the
cove the boats are banging on these poles and they're panicking they're the old i'm imagining
all this but i know what's going on the old are left behind because they can't keep up
there are there are pregnant females who are aborting they're panic-stricken there and so i
experience all this with them and they're driven into the cove it's sealed
and a lot of them i'm watching them on the surface they take that last breath young ones
and the mother you can watch them getting together and they sink and they don't come back up again
that that's what i'm talking about because nobody can see that but me that is self-induced asphyxiation
they're committing suicide so it's not it's not uncommon
would not because that ambearable uh if i were
anatomically equipped like they are i probably would have done the same thing
in that japanese prison and a few other places i've been just not taking that next breath
are there in the um in the also in the cove documentary you mentioned there's another town
in japan that no longer has any dolphins there that would be uh ito yeah icky or ito icky island
excuse me icky island icky island icky island yeah because there's two types of dolphins right it's
the same with orcas there's there's uh i had this guy force galante on the show a couple months ago
and he was explaining to me how um there's transient orcas yeah that basically like they
just roam they don't stop and they eat anything they have their their diet is very uh they have a
wide palette right and then there's other ones that kind of like stay centralized into one specific
area is that the case in in icky island where they just like one localized group of dolphins
that they were all killed now there's none there yeah and they were doing the same thing they were
doing in in tai chi no in tai chi those are all transient those are all those ones are all transient
but they were doing the same slaughter in icky island yeah same thing and now they are very upset
because they can't sell the dolphins for you know they were selling the meat and that you can buy a
the size of this of like the size of a soap bar soap probably five dollars
um selling that dolphin alive to do buy a couple hundred thousand dollars probably
so it's really about live dolphin shows right that's one of the problems with these dolphin
shows is the copycat syndrome when people come through seaworld or uh wherever clear water and
they watch these dolphin shows they go wow i can and people swim me with it you can charge a hundred
bucks right what you can dolphins will heal us we can charge them eight thousand dollars and they
do these places charge eight ten thousand dollars insurance companies pay for it and it's all fake
it's all phony dolphins cannot heal us they can't heal themselves the dolphins that we have in uh
uh sanctuary in in bali all came from dolphins uh dolphin uh what are they called assisted therapy
and these are all russian tourists who are coming to bali to be healed by the dolphins
and my heart goes out to that poor mother i still get calls from germany a lot from germany switzerland
i my my child's got autism i was calling you i hope it's okay to call you at home
i'm going to take my daughter to the dolphin research center to have a program there but
what do you think about that i'm gonna this woman's being ripped off fault hope dolphin can't heal her
where the alliance of marine parks they know about all this and they allow it this fraud
and this uh because disney does it and you know all of these dolphin swim programs dolphin research
center dolphins plus who came up with the idea that dolphins can heal us when i worked at the
sea aquarium people pay five dollars they buy a ticket they would sit in their seat and i would
put on a show for them they're playing basketball and they're jumping and blah blah blah they would
applaud and they would leave some accountant's probably in the front office went wait a minute
let's let the let's let them in the water with the dolphins we can charge a hundred dollars instead
of five five dollars instead of twenty dollars or and so that that became this swim with dolphins
craze then let's tell them they can heal us autistic children and you know you got people
like dave phil dave uh dave uh psychologist one of those guys calls himself's doctor he's got a
degree in psychology and he started his craze with uh dolphin assistant therapy
does he own dolphins no he came to the sea aquarium first he came over to my house he
wanted me to be partners with him and i i i listened to him and i could tell he's just
exploiting him he's just wants money yeah and uh and i just i just wouldn't talk to him anymore
um
and he just sort of labeled me as being anti-social because i never come to the meetings and discuss
this is what they're doing this dolphin assistant therapy it's fraud full below the fraud
but he's retired now these people are looking at these people are looking at dolphins like uh
like a real estate investor looks at an old dilapidated apartment building they see you know
they can fill up x amount of units and rent and get x amount of rent every single month
and it has a lifespan that's that's exactly how they're looking at it
you're just paying for your kid's happiness this kid's autistic here yeah i can tell that's what
they're doing here now the kid is actually getting something out of it no let me let me let me show
you something uh huh okay what's the yeah this is a very this is these first trick it's or they
call it a behavior it's called targeting targeting this is targeting this is targeting but this is
targeting what happens is the first thing you train a dolphin to do is to touch your hand
okay target touch it blow the whistle that means that's the bridge that means yeah you did it right
i'm going to give you a fish uh if you don't touch my hand you're not going to get a fish
they catch up real quick okay now you can replace that once they get that down
might take a few months might take a week might take a year depends on how how long it takes you
as the trainer to get the idea across they're ready immediately they're smarter than we are that
that's targeting right here right you can replace that now with your foot
okay okay they got that now when you see the show you see the when you see the
trainer being pushed through the water it's the same targeting trick with the foot with the foot
now you could take something this size
like a cone like a glass that goes on the dolphin snap these are dolphins of war in the navy
program for the swimmer nullification system at the end of this device
you know what a bank stick is underwater yeah shark thing yeah yeah yeah so it's like a it's
like a spear it's a spearhead tip with like a shotgun shell at the end of it or a yeah
so this thing is equipped with a the swimmer nullification system that you put on their
stout and they'll go over and simply target the target diver in their training
dolphin has no idea there's a 45 caliber bullet in there and they wouldn't put that bullet in
unless it was a combat situation but they're trained every day without the bullet the bullet's
been replaced actually with a uh well i think it's the shotgun shell that i actually blew
my thumb off with one of them what and um and so how did that happen we were working on a movie
called uh i was doing a lot of stunt work in those days yeah uh thunderball well it wasn't
thunderball we did thunderball but it was another one like thunderball called never say never again
james bond movie and it was like we were just starting i think it was the second day we were
there and the diving barge was in like for key and maybe a mile out and we have a sea pen
in nassau we used to film flipper uh that's where the dolphins were so seven o'clock in the morning
luke helping the kid who was starting in the flipper show he's now a grown 40 years old or
whatever it was he's one of the stuff he and i were in boston whaler 13 foot boston where we go
over to pick up one of the sharks 13 foot shark much bigger than this table and bring it out to
where we're going to film it and i i i loaded the bank stick with a with a 12 gauge shotgun shell
put the safety in and then a swell came and lifted the boat up like this
and i lost my balance and i went to grab the gondola the boat and i grabbed the bank stick and it went
fucked up my whole day blew your thumb off yeah yeah that's a that's not a good day
so i went out to the barge i wrapped my hand in a towel got out to the barge riko was there
and he didn't know what would happen but he could see the blood and uh yeah it was one of those
yeah and these are outlawed now because i got those taken off the market which those things
these things will fly right out that that's the safety it doesn't work it doesn't work i had them
taken off the market you had them taken off how'd you do that i sued them uh decor dive company
i sued them took him to court and oh my god yeah it just pops right out see that's the only thing
that's separating the firing pin from the shell is this pin right here oh okay and and and because
this is like a spring it just pops out and that's what happened it popped out kaboom we jump into a
car and go to i told before i passed out i said do not take me to princess margaret hospital
because i've been in there before and they would have just amputated it away up here somewhere
right get me to miami right so there was a plane landing a little piper cover or something and i
we just ran out to the thing and i the guy was getting out of the back seat and i just got him
out of my i got in the back seat and i passed out i wake up we're in my i'm in mercy hospital in
miami waiting for the doctor still in my wetsuit full of blood got the towel around my and i'm looking
in the it's not a mirror it's a stainless steel towel rack and i could see my face and the thumb
that was missing was all over my face oh my gosh that's when i really got scared because
it told me that that shotgun shell uh was so close to me it could have blown my head off
you know wow man that's fucking terrifying man yeah it was and it put me out of work for
a couple of years because i i had an uh i was trying to do push-ups i was trying to become
uh left-handed i was doing push-ups and stuff like that and i pinched the nerve of my neck anyhow
i hadn't worked in a long time finally i get a call to go do a job here in st pete beach at the
dancy's our hotel what kind of job it's a job in a um berry give music video and i have to
repel from the top of the building in a tuxedo with a rose between my teeth so i go to miami beach
and i'm talking to these guys you know they're interviewing me said have you ever done this
before i said what mean repel yeah i was repelling out of helicopters in rice paddies
while people are shooting at me you got the job i went home i called my buddy hank who actually
was in vietnam and was repelling i had never done it before but i knew i could i became you know
of course so he i you had two story house we got from the roof and he showed me how to do it like
10 minutes or something next day lincoln and i get in the car lincoln it's only like third
grade or something and we go to the dancy's our hotel i've never been here before and they take
me up to my the penthouse there's two penthouses there's your room the room next to me had a sign
on the door that said do not disturb underscored three times with exclamation points i think that's
probably barry's room who's barry gibb oh barry yeah yeah yeah right it says movie you're right next
to him oh my god i never saw him though so next morning i go down to do the job and uh that was
scared shitless and uh and so i look over the edge i can see lincoln down in the pool is like the
size of an ant with barry gibbs kids they're all playing in the pool and and so i did it three or
four times and the guy didn't like it is the only time i have ever been fired i well i wasn't fired
he just didn't like it the director i said okay he don't want to pay me i went back up and i knocked
on that sign it said do not disturb and barry opens the the door and lets me in and i explained
what happened he was very cordial very nice about it had somebody come up paid me off in hundred
dollar bills off i went i can i'll show you i have that video so whenever i'm here in st
pete beach where i now live and uh i have meetings with people that come over and do interviews and
stuff i always have them meet me there so i can show them my the video at the dawn yeah that's great
uh laylona mutter her husband came down for a visit once and i was telling him this story
and we're at the pool at the don seas are having lunch and she said what's the name of it i said i
don't know i never saw it before i i've never seen it it was like 20 years earlier you know
somehow she found it it's called uh
night is for lovers or something like that uh huh and i said music video i i didn't understand it but
why am i telling you about this i don't know it's funny it's it's it's interesting man it's
entertaining you were saying before we started that you still have people from seaworld who spy on
you oh yeah of course why wouldn't they they want to know what i'm doing i people come to my office
they make it obvious if i watch them yeah they make it real obvious see mcculloch was one of them
i'll give you the example he came into my office do you know who he is no he was one of the dolphin
wranglers anyhow oh yeah i want to help so i he he he went and bought his own camera video camera
and went to seaworld ohio i made a very damaging video at the petting pool which is a very abusive
most abusive pool in tank in the seaworld that's where everybody grumps the dolphins and teases
them with food and all this and he shot this powerful video it was so powerful we held a press
conference in san diego where seaworld was headquartered and uh steve calls me just before
the press conference it says i don't know what happened somebody must have broken my room last
night and stole the video i don't have it do we had to cancel out the press conference
in reality he gave it to brad andrews who was the president of who was there in town at the press
conference he gave it to him and he works very closely with them even to this day so that's the
kind of you know of course they want to know what we're doing right anybody can volunteer
save us true with the japanese police why would they not volunteer and help us join us in taiji
easy to do you're looking for volunteers they like so we don't have any secrets we don't
have any lies any secrets everything's an open book and we don't care if you are part of there
is this an everyday thing yeah
yeah i think come in contact i don't come in contact with people that much
anymore every day right frankly what is what are you and um lincoln doing right now in bali and
indonesia like what's going on there i remember during or in the film the blood dolphin film
there was a guy named chris porter some wacko yeah who was from canada who had a uh had a
bunch of dolphinariums out there what's dolphin dealer he was a dolphin dealer yeah and so he uh
he was he was selling dolphins to the dolphinariums in mexico okay
dubai excuse me um and uh the dolphin trainers who worked on the free willy movie worked with him
after that movie in other words those guys really weren't against captivity at all
right they're in it for a six-figure job they're gonna get it until the 20 million is gone then
they're gonna go back to did you i did you guys is that guy still a dolphin and an active dolphin
dealer did you guys put the kibosh on him oh no he wouldn't be dealing nobody would he's he's been
out it there's no way he could uh traffic and dolphins anymore i don't know what he's doing
but he's out of business there so so what's next for you guys what's uh obviously lincoln's got his
documentary coming up that you guys are working on but um he's working on it i don't even think
about it i don't even know what exactly you know it's his thing and you you uh you said obviously
you guys have some stuff in the works as far as lawsuits in japan yeah um but what other big issues
are you trying to tackle at the moment it's the captivity issue and it could change at any moment
with another phone call or email or uh while i was sitting here with you the sequering closed
right but trying to do that since 1970 that's what i'm talking about what so what am i going to do
about that i don't know i gotta get out of here and go there that's how it works right it's very
organic no matter what you plan i'm planning i want to go see my wife and daughter that's what i
like to do they're in denmark in denmark um and we connect up in different parts of the world when
i somebody wants to interview me they'll fly me into paris or something and that's when i get to
see my family or they'll come here and what's next for me is that i mean like uh so i mean it seems
like you are just this you're sort of a vigilante that goes after these dolphin air these captive
dolphins and you try to catch you take them and you you rescue them and it seems like you kind of
take it one piece at a time right like are there are there any i mean i don't know if you want to
give stuff up in public but like are there any certain parts of the world that you are more
focused on than the other other than norway japan indonesia indonesia japan uh that's
that's the big one the two big ones right now but it seems like the indonesian government's
working with you yeah there are partners right the minister for the environment and the minister for
the uh for fisheries she works for this we want to build a really big one in in uh portugal portugal
is on our radar right now they have 35 dolphins in portugal all of them were born in captivity
except for two that were captured in pine island florida that are too old to come back to our
pine island florida so they're going to need a sanctuary a big big sanctuary somewhere
in europe or somewhere in portugal we're working on that when i leave here yeah i'll go pick up my
wife uh we'll put the car on the ferry boat and go to uh norway and check on the whale
and then go to portugal and get back to work on that by then maybe um we will have to return to
indonesia if we have the five dolphins we get a phone call that you know come on back we're good
it happens very quickly things happen very quickly what um do you think there's
any one end all be all solution to all of this like if like if if the the president
of the united states said rick we're going to make you in charge we're going to put you in
charge of all this you're going to be able to make the final decision on all dolphin
captivity obviously we can't we can't control the entire world but we kind of do um
um what do you think a diplomatic end all be all solution would be to this problem well let's
just look at the are you talking about the industry in the united states or the industry
all over the world because it's everywhere but if you want to let's start with the united states
okay let's focus on just sequering
what what do you do about sequering now it's closed
all those animals are lives hanging the balance
they need a sanctuary somewhere they can't be released back into the wild many of them
don't even know what that is they've never seen the the wild
hmm i think the majority of captive dolphins older ones are psychotic
right what do you do with them sanctuary a place where they can experience the natural
rhythms of the sea the tide and the current the rain the sunshine these simple natural elements
have healing properties when they're inside of a tank they
it's dead there's nothing moving there's nothing alive there it's not organic there's just a wall
sometimes there'll be a like in a sink or a toilet bowl you see the water going down the drain
they'll just be looking at that because there's nothing else inside of this barren tank to look at
i have spent years underwater in these tanks with them the tourists the management the authorities
haven't they don't know what they're doing they don't realize how cruel that is kind of like if
you were in this room for the rest of your life let's get rid of all this stuff that you can look at
and interact with and there's nothing in this room how long would your mind be healthy right
not very long that's what they do until they go fucking crazy so if you put them as soon as you
as soon as you move them like when we take them out of the hotel swimming pool in bali
in the stretchers Lincoln will give you this footage you can do a voiceover
and we take them to a truck there's a box waiting box is about the size of this table only longer
and it has some water in it maybe a foot it's got a big thick foam rubber soft padding in it so
that when you place the dolphin stretcher inside the box the stomach you know all of the weight of
their weight 350 pounds is on their internal organs so you got to compensate for that right
as soon as we get them to the sanctuary and place them into
the seapan they're for the first time since they were captured experiencing the sounds of the sea
there's a lot of sounds that they're hearing for the first time and what we want we want them to
remember who they were before they were captured we don't teach them we don't train them to be wild
again you can't train the dolphin to become wild again you they didn't train keiko to become a wild
orca again the training itself is the problem training it to do more is not going to solve the
problem nature heals them the salt water as i and nine has healing elements in it catching their
own fish in captivity they're simply opening their mouth and somebody is dumping a dead fish
in their mouth living is actually chasing that fish the hunt the hunt itself is is living
and that was all taken away from them so
you have to get them in a place where you have to give them back all the things we took away from
them when they were captured and and and that's what heals them it's not they heal themselves
some of them cannot be free during the whole process you can watch what they do and how they
act uh what example one of them was banging his head against the dock constantly we knew
there's something wrong with this guy we're not freeing him right so you have to watch him every
single day all day long and all night and it's you're playing god because you are going to figure
out whether they're going to be free or they're going to be in here the rest of their life whatever
happens to them it's a it's a huge responsibility i take it very serious too but looking at it from
numb capitalist perspective how do you incentivize corporations to walk away from billions of
dollars and put money into something like this that doesn't generate any sort of profit i don't
i don't i don't i would be a waste of time they're not going to i don't have any expectations of
the government fixing it i don't deal with them i don't listen to them i don't pay any attention to
them but the customer it's well not the customers the only hope and i've thought about this sounds
awfully simplistic but the only solution is for people to stop buying tickets there is no other
solution they're never going to stop it's not going to happen you can waste your time doing that if
you want to right but it's based on supply and demand like any other product you stop buying this
uh bud light or whatever it is they're in trouble it's up to the consumer so our work
is really about educating the consumer so when we're doing a release that's why these dolphin
releases or sanctuaries are so important because for the first time the audience same people who
were buying tickets are seeing this process and learning for themselves oh yeah i get it now i get
it they're not going to get it from the propaganda that the odor is telling everybody on the chain
all the way down to the trainers the product because i was i was the head trainer at the
sequery i know how it works that you in order to be successful that trainer has to become
a professional liar you have to lie to the customers every day when they ask you questions
you have to lie to the media and you first of all you have to lie to yourself every day
what do you lie about three things education research and conservation that's what we're
doing here right well they are five percent yeah and those rescues and stuff right yeah your great
exit nobody does it better yeah that's five percent though right
and all of the dolphins everything you see in taiji that massacre is a direct you could directly
connected to those people who are selling tickets to their dolphin area because it's the copycat
syndrome over here that keeps them fueling them and they don't police their own industry so
fuck those people i don't deal with them right they don't like me i don't have a pathological need
to be liked so i'm okay with that do you maintain any relationships with any former dolphin trainers
that you used to work with or that are currently involved in any of these operations do you ever
talk to them or do you ever have interventions no no no i've been touched with a couple but they've
left recently and there'll be more at this aquarium now i'm gonna i just can't i can't fathom
house a person who would want to dedicate their career to spending time with these animals you
have to be passionate about this topic and you have to you if you're a trainer don't you make some
sort of a connection with these animals and how could you if you are that person it's not real
it's not real it's it's it's the same dilemma duality i live with with the flibber dolphins
yeah you're i you you walk away you go home and you live your life yeah you you you were trying to
get them to to to be your friend and it's a stock home syndrome at best right at best right i was
going through the stock home syndrome in reverse where i would need to let people come around the
dolphins uh i i i was i became one of them one of the dolphins and i was rebelling the same way
they were because i could see how how wrong this whole thing is now if i wanted to at that point
seaworld hadn't been built yet i had a reputation as the highest paid dolphin trainer in the world
i could have been running seaworld i could do that when i leave here i could go down to the
Bahamas start a dolphin swim program with two or three dolphins and be making three four million
dollars a year but i wouldn't be able to sleep at night right instead i go to taiji where i can't
sleep at night how long till you go back to taiji you're gonna go back this with this summer the
only reason i'm not there now is i want to go with you we well we don't have enough money to go back
i should be there right now all the time i shouldn't leave there because during those six months i could
be putting events together in tokyo we did one with uh matt soram who's also not just a drummer
he's a good really good singer songwriter and so he could entertain the whole week and we invited
all the japanese activists to this vegan club and they all came and it was so successful that
so they're they became all the japanese protesters oh really yeah they're the ones who are there now
and so the problem isn't taiji but the solution is in tokyo
and getting them to step up and take ownership of this but to do that requires money for me to go
to japan i have to fly business class now at 84 because i can't sit in the chair that long right
the last time i did it um packed in like a sardine the last time i did that
it was about uh six or seven years ago i remember getting up from the seat the light came off and
instead you can walk around the plane i was going to the bathroom i remember opening the door to the
bathroom and the next thing i know i'm lying in a pool of blood oh god and i'm hearing on
their loudspeaker if there's a doctor on the plane and i'm thinking i think they're talking about me
and there's a woman is in my face very lovely black doctor yeah she said we have to turn the
plane around and go back uh you have a large gash what happened was i passed out and i fell
backwards and hit my head and so forth and it was the i tell you how long ago it was it was i had
to be there for the world premiere of the cove the premiere in japan at the ford or the pundits
here it's a big yeah i said don't turn this plane around i have to be there she said i said please
listen to me just put some ice on it when i get to uh the place i'll uh tokyo i'll get stitches and
blah blah blah but trust me i'll be okay they didn't really want to turn around anyhow so right
they didn't when i get to tokyo the wheelchair comes in they take me down and the guy says too late
we can't sew it up now you waited too long they let me go now i'm going but they shaved half of my
head to look at it now i'm going to the premiere i think i wore a hat or something yeah whatever
happened so what happened was i it's just exhausting and and i don't fly unless i get on the plane
now and i lay down right i've lost two friends on airplanes uh albert grossman bob jillens manager
died on a plane like that how and fred neils manager i don't know how maybe you're you're
both not circulating or something i don't know but people do die on airplanes
those who are laying down i think are so i lay down take a sleeping pill and i wake up i'm in
tokyo or wherever i'm going that's how i do it whatever happened with the people but it's expensive
you know it's like eight thousand bucks or something to fly first class to japan yeah yeah no it's business
class oh business class yeah that's guess it's not first class but it's it's still expensive you fly
from la right it depends on where i am usually from why mark for no from dead oh from denmark
i've been living in denmark where i came here right so whatever happened with the people
who were involved with uh purchasing the documentary in japan wasn't there a group
that purchased the rights in japan for the documentary and they they somehow the yakuza
stopped the distribution of the documentary in japan like in theaters oh yeah that went off for a
long time yeah and they would actually go into the distributors house the yakuza
um they have these black trucks with big megaphones out of
and they on saturdays and sundays they go to the homes of uh koreans chinese people they don't like
they're racist they're like the kkk really oh yeah there's a lot of racism you know in japan
yeah people don't they're there are places of it they have this sign that says uh japanese only
and so they did this at the taiji whale museum where which is actually a uh dolphinarium and
they're the number one distributor of dolphins so we go in there we monitor them closely one day
we go in there they had to sign up can't buy a ticket japanese only we took in the court sued them
it wasn't and they had to take that down it's racism wow
so i think lawsuits is the way to stop this thing because the courts seem to be fair which they're
right right yeah well that's that's hopeful yeah that the court the supreme court system in japan
is is uh working with you and you're being successful um where so where can people that are
listening to this where can they get in contact with you where can they do anything to help the
dolphin project and what you and linkin are doing go to dolphinproject.com and take action
what's take action mean well people uh they can donate they can come with us to japan if they
want to or uh volunteer to do different things but maybe it's a shop buy a t-shirt support that
take action adopt a dolphin if people get people in this area are getting involved in that campaign
to disney dolphins there why well disney world has a lot of dolphins oh disney world has a lot of
their living seas exhibit used to have a hundred percent mortality rate
yep wow so you can adopt a dolphin so you can basically pay to have a dolphin rescued is that
what that means yeah when we have when we rescue them uh and they we have to feed them it's very
expensive right people adopt it that helps offset our bills that's incredible we are not part of the
animal welfare industry that's a big big industry that i want nothing to do with yeah
we're outside of that we're grassroots and we're going to stay that way we got to get
you on more podcasts why don't you do more podcasts i know i just did this because linkin
kept pestering me i don't like doing the frankly uh we got to make this we got to make you ubiquitous
man that's the only way to let the people know not to buy tickets to these places yeah i know i've
doubted for so long i'm just tired of it now after 70 years of this you know it's basically the same
interview like the challenge is how do i change the words right that's okay yeah but it'll worry you
out too well thanks again man thank you i appreciate it rick it's been a pleasure talking to you good
night everybody
