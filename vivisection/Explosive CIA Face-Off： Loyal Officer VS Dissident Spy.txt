We have a lot to talk about today with yesterday's events too yeah what was
yesterday yesterday the secretary of defense threw out the guilty plea the
plea deal yeah the plea deal for Khalid shake Muhammad yeah oh yes oh yeah we
definitely should talk about that route out square one after 22 years wait what
do you mean threw it out oh he overwrote it it must be under UCM Jay it is under
UCM Jay so so now that he's gonna get executed no we don't know we don't know
what happens next see but this this is the reason why they engaged in plea
negotiations in the first place everything that they said that implicated
themselves Steve timer sorry they said under torture and so it's it's not
admissible even in the military tribunal and there's a precedent for that
from five years ago so do you want to roll the dice I mean it's probably like
a zero point one percent chance of you know of an acquittal but you can't
really convict them if you don't have any independent evidence against them
everything you have came as a result of torture so why don't we just come to an
agreement they plead guilty to 2,974 counts of murder right yeah and material
support for terrorism they get life without parole and the only thing that
they ask is that they do not want to spend winters in Colorado I'm serious so
it was part of the deal that they won't be sent to Florence that they get to stay
in Guantanamo and sect f said that that really burned me yesterday I mean
honestly if you're if you don't have a camera running you should have a camera
running the cameras are running we're cameras oh we're rolling sweet yeah the
only thing that burned me about this whole thing was that was that Mitch
McConnell made a statement saying this is disgusting this is sickening this is
bad that blah blah blah I went back to 2009 I found the original statement from
Mitch McConnell saying oh my god we can't have them come to the United States
we I've told you before that in March of 2002 we had captured so many al Qaeda
fighters in Pakistan that we literally filled the Raul Pindi jail they said we
can't hold them anymore yeah and the Pax came and said look the jail's full you
got to do something with them I called CTC I said the jail's full the Pax want
them out what do I do with them they said put them on a C12 and send them to
Guantanamo I said Guantanamo Cuba why would we do that and they said oh this
is what we've come up with we're gonna put them in Cuba we're gonna hold them
there three or four weeks until we could figure out if we should try them in the
Eastern District of Virginia the Southern District of New York or the
District of Massachusetts I said that's a great idea so we put them on the on the
C12 you know they stop an Oman for refueling they go the rest of the way
and and it turned out the White House said other other ideas and then of
course the real high-value targets that we had captured got special treatment
but then as a result you can't you can't use any of that evidence so even
before the torture started with 9-11 being an open criminal investigation you
want to gather that information so that you can try them and find them guilty
and execute them as they deserved but the agency blew it and then Mitch
McConnell and I looked up the vote the vote was 93 to 5 so it's not just
Republicans Democrats were just as guilty in the in the house it was the
Democrats that did it was Ike Skeleton who was a congressman from Missouri he
was the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee at the time they
joined together and they said we can't have these dangerous terrorists on
American soil it's too dangerous because they had never heard of Charles
Manson or Ted Kaczynski or the blind shake or you know Jeffrey Dahmer but we
don't have dangerous people in the United States we can't have these Arab
terrorists and as a result they've been in this limbo all the time since 2002 so I
guess I guess we're out I'm confused you you were you well I think what you're
saying is that because sect f overrode the plea deal we're back to square one
mm-hmm with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed the mastermind of 9-11 and and more than a
handful of other I think two other yeah I'm Mustafa al-Hassawi and Waleed
bin Atash but the I mean for me I can I can understand why he overrode it right
oh you can't politically I get it yeah sure he had to you can't it's an
election year well you can't have you can't have the people who orchestrated
9-11 mm-hmm get off on a plea deal yes and I get it it's it's a sticky
situation but it's the UCMJ yes UCMJ is the military court of justice correct
which is not the civilian court of justice no and while it is unusual to
have a civilian and of course Secretary of Defense has to be civilian it's
unusual to have a civilian claim the authority to overturn it he's within
his legal rights to overshare well I agree with him overturning it because you
can't have them just like we said you can't have these men get out on a plea
deal see but what scares me election year or not election year like but but
that's exactly what scares me because if you can't try them because you can't use
that information against them then what do you do with them well they're not
American citizens but they still have constitutional rights and maybe that's
the better question to be asking well see that's for the Supreme Court but they
did say that why do they have constitutional rights because they're
in US custody okay so they have I mean the most basic of rights they have they
have the right to face their accusers in a court of law and they have a right to a
jury a trial by jury of their peers unless it's a military in peers but
that's the thing they don't have any they don't have any peers and they're in the
military system so it's not going to be a jury their peers it's going to be a
military jury or even a non-jury military trial but again you come back to
that issue of not being able to use the evidence against them the CIA screwed
that because we can't use any evidence because they were tortured they were
tortured and all the evidence they gave up and everything they admitted to was
while they were chained to an I beam or technically technically when they gave
up that information it was legal because it had been sanctified by a court
OLC and then later that decision was overturned and that's when terrorism or
that's when torture became illegal so their evidence was admissible and then
the policy changed and that meant that their evidence is now inadmissible
correct according to like certain lines of the law and that's that's what sucks
about not just this case but many cases where where confidential courts get
overruled by civilian courts yeah which is exactly what our court system does
a system of court system in Virginia can come into a conclusion that a court
system in the appeal court changes that the Supreme Court changes so it's just
it's a it's a sticky element of our judicial process that's true yeah it's
it's a chaotic system hmm so okay that was kind of a shotgun start for this
podcast where's the loop people play so for people I love it so I'm super
excited to have you guys both in here together I think this is the first time
two people of you know your status who have been involved in the central
intelligence agency like you guys have been together on a podcast to discuss
these issues together and I think you guys have a lot of the same views on
most things but maybe some diverging views on a couple topics so to start out
the podcast can you guys just give like a brief 20 30 second background on your
involvement in the United States government and CIA Andy you want to
sure so I started with the US government when I was 18 years old I was
recruited in the Air Force Academy graduated from the Air Force Academy in
2003 went on to become a US Air Force officer nuclear missile officer learned
how to fly then got picked up by CIA coming out of the military in 2007 where
I spent seven years working with the National Clan Destined Service as a
staff operations officer certified or who went through the FTC program and and
left CIA in 2014 yeah good I was recruited in the CIA in graduate school
1989 started 1st January 1990 as an analyst spent my first seven years in
analysis all in the Middle East served overseas learned how to speak Arabic then
switched to not just operations but counterterrorism operations and what was
then the directorate of operations now the National Clan Destined Service and
specialized in counterterrorism operations in Athens and the Arabian
Peninsula then went to Pakistan after 9-11 as the chief of counterterrorism
operations back to headquarters as the executive assistant to the deputy director
for operations and then I finished out my career at the at the UN in New York
and then the end of your career can you explain basically what happened to you
in your career I went into the private sector it's a long story I'll make it
very very short in 2007 I went public with this with information on the CIA's
torture program the FBI investigated me for a year determined that I hadn't
committed a crime a year later Barack Obama became president and and brought
with him the lovely and talented John Brennan back to the National Security
Council Brennan asked Eric Holder to secretly reopen the case against me I
didn't know of course that's why it was a secret and three years later I was
charged with five felonies including three counts of espionage four of those
felonies were dropped because I hadn't committed espionage but ended up going to
prison for 23 months make no apologies for it proud that I did it somebody had
to do it kind of regret the result but you know worth it in the long run
right to start I wanted to sort of like lay a foundation here to have can I get
each of you to describe what key values underpin your stance on America democracy
and CIA's role in the world gotcha so I'll go first I believe that the America is not
perfect the United States is not perfect but it is by leaps and bounds the best
of the government's national civilized options that exist today and for that
reason I believe that anything we can do to maximize American superiority maintain
our status as the number one superpower in the world is an imperative that we
all have to work towards because if we are not the superpower somebody else
will be CIA's role in that is to serve at the behest of the chief executive the
president to execute operations clandestinely around the world whether
it's technical collection or human collection that benefit national security
policy which is aimed at American superiority which is intended to maintain
our status as the only superpower in the world my personal values my company
values remain very steadily in that in that vein because that's where I come
from and that's what I've seen to be true John I don't I don't disagree with
any of that you know the DDO when I was working for him said something once that
was that was so simple that it's sort of become a mantra of mine the who the I'm
sorry the deputy director for operations so he said that the job of the CIA is to
recruit spies to steal secrets and to analyze those secrets to allow policymakers
to make the best informed policy possible it's really that simple and I agree with
that that's what the CIA should be doing but at the same time my driving how
should I say it my my driving belief behind that is that it has to do it
within the confines of the law and I'm not talking about foreign laws the job
of a CIA officer is to violate foreign laws right you're you're committing
espionage you're convincing foreign nationals to commit espionage or in
some cases to commit treason for you because they like you or because maybe
they're ideologically pro-american or maybe they're doing it just for a couple
of dollars or to get their kid in college or whatever but we need to we need
to be guided by the rule of law in the United States there was a period there
have been a couple of periods over the course of the history of the CIA where
we've gotten away from that and it has never turned out well the definition
of laws the definition of rule of law is a flexible definition it depends on
who's president yeah you're right about that depends on the court system it
depends on the judge it depends on what's been voted in and what's been
voted out it was legal once to beat women mm-hmm it was legal once to keep
black people from voting children working in the mines right so it's not it's a
it's about much more than legality it's about much more than following the
letter of the law it's about constitutionality I would say because
look at it this way you know in in 1945 1946 we executed Japanese soldiers who
had waterboarded American POWs in in 1968 on January the 11th 1968 the
Washington Post ran a front page photograph of an American soldier
waterboarding a North Vietnamese prisoner that that soldier was arrested
convicted of torture and sent to sent to prison for for 20 years for torture
and then all of a sudden in 2002 tortures legal because John UNJ by be say
it is but the law never changed the law was never amended Congress never voted
on any change in the federal Torture Act of 1946 so you know we changed the
definition of torture also changed well or it was never fully defined they
elected to change it in fact it was defined because not only were we
signatories to the UN convention against torture Steve is that a bald spot no

now back to the show we wrote the UN convention against torture so we
actually delineated what was illegal and what was legal and then we violated it
and said well you know exigent circumstances it's a time of war even
though it wasn't because Congress never declared war and that's a whole
different issue we can yell about Congress too but but we changed and so it
was as you mentioned a moment ago five years later we said oh you know what
maybe we shouldn't have done that maybe that was wrong well you know if we're
gonna be the as Ronald Reagan said the shining city on it on a hill this beacon
of hope for human rights and civil rights and civil liberties then let's be
it we can't be it when it's convenient for us we we can't we're getting we're
getting ideologically we're getting ideology confused with practicality and
that's the thing that sucks it sucks because you can't always stick to your
ideals you just can't and America is a country that's built on ideals but
America is also a country that's nine years old compared to the rest of the
world sure right we're juveniles we're children compared to what society has
been for in in Central Europe in East Asia and Latin America so yes we came on
the scene and we were big heavy hitters and we came out of World War two as the
dominant superpower especially with the fall of the Berlin Wall and all we've
really had to stand on since then is our our ideals but we don't live by our
ideals no we don't talk ideals and we execute something totally different and
we've all the time we've always been that way yes parents are that way bosses are
that way yeah that is that is the way the world works so we can't my point with
that is that we can't say that we're violating our own ideals we always
violate our that's what winners do winners violate they change the rules doesn't
make it if you've got a congressional mandate for example to write a human
rights report every year for every country in the world that we have
diplomatic relations with and you tell them look you know you can't you can't
I'll give you an example my own personal example I had to go to the minister of
of interior and Bahrain and say your highness you cannot kill a 15 year old
boy because he marched in a pro-democracy demonstration you can't do that I'm
gonna have to report that to Congress and then Congress is gonna have to weigh
whether or not to suspend military sales for 12 months but then you've got
the CIA station chief going in saying don't pay any attention to the human
rights guy we want you to open the secret facility over here where we can
take people nobody's gonna know about it we're gonna give you a hundred million
dollars or fifty million dollars whatever okay what's he gonna do there
sure there are practicalities real politic is a real thing but we can't
pretend to be one thing and then be the other we have to choose and if we want
to be the bad guys okay that's a policy decision that can be made but then we
have to change the law we are 100% able to not choose we don't have to choose but
then what do you do about the about the legality of it the legality of it
changes the legality of it is what you put in motion the legality of it is is
absolutely flexible the idea the Supreme Court it's not the Supreme Court is
fucking flexible mm different justices of different beliefs make different
decisions all the time they even choose what the fuck to what like what to look
at and what to send back down to the lower courts like you can't but you
can't possibly actually believe that we are the system that we tell the average
American we are of course not I'm saying that we should strive to be the
fucking way dude it's chaos otherwise no it's not it's chaos to not try oh I
think that's nuts it's chaos to not try all you have to do is convince people
that you're trying to not try yeah to say to say that what we're striving for is
too much so we're not going to try anymore is to give people no goal people
without a goal are lost people who achieve a goal are lost people who are
pursuing a goal have focus mm-hmm and that's that's what the magic sauce is in
the United States yeah but that's why it's always a changing goalpost because
then there's always something to pursue for the lay person while the people who
are at the highest levels are also constantly coming in and out like that's
part of our weakness but that's also part of our strength but listen to what
you're saying though you're saying that we've got torture that's illegal in 1946
a torture that's illegal in 1968 torture that's legal in 2002 maybe it is
maybe it isn't let's just torture and see if anybody stops us we'll see what
the Supreme Court says oh five years later the Supreme Court says we can't
do that okay so what do we do we just tortured these guys they can't go on
trial they can't be punished until they go on trial we can't just chalk that up
to American greatness they have to have laws we have to have rubrics by which we
we operate every day I'm not saying that we are we should be lawless or have no
and so no no rubric to follow what I'm saying is we can't let ourselves
bureaucratize no I don't disagree with that for no reason and that's
essentially like KSM has been in jail for 26 years it's not been
pleasant no he's never gonna get out no the question is really sure the question
is just how do we deliver justice in a way that is congruent with the loss that
the families of those 2,900 lies how do you even gauge something like that exactly
exactly there's no right answer there whether the guy rots in jail whether
his head is cut off in jail whether he's marched through the square and
everybody gets to throw tomatoes at him there is no way that we are going to
ever fulfill what the expectations are of all of those families who lost someone
on 9-11 there's no way it's gonna be done the legal system isn't gonna do it
the UCMJ system isn't gonna do it like it's it's like it's an impossibility to
even try then what do you do that's the question right and for me for me it's
just it's if we let ourselves get stuck in the cycle of what's what's approved
by what court what's legal right now and what whatever we're asking the wrong
questions like we need to figure out what is the right thing to do and saying
the torture is the wrong thing to do our policies around torture have always
been convenient yeah in the 1940s we define torture as one thing that was
convenient for what we wanted to accomplish and then we changed that in
2002 and then we changed it again we're probably gonna change it we didn't
change it we changed the interpretation of it that's what that's what law is and
then and then the court came back and said no you were wrong and that's why
it was codified with the with a mccain feinstein amendment in 2015 to get back
to the original federal tortractive 1946 we had strayed so far away from it that
mccain feinstein came back and said look this is the original language that's the
language we're gonna use in the in the army field manual which is another
mistake I can say in a second and so the law is what's in the army field manual
the mistake is the army field manual is an executive branch document that can
be changed with the stroke of a pen so it's codified but not really codified and
that's what our whole system is built on it's a house of cards then but it's the
best house of cards that's out there unless you want to build a house out of
bricks that are authoritarian bricks oh I disagree I I mean sure I can see how I
can see how rule of law can become an authoritarian system yes I can I can see
that but at the same time we have to have a framework by which we we live and by
which we lead and you know I've mentioned to you I think in the past that on a
trip to Africa one time I was kind of joking with a with a Congolese foreign
ministry official about to joke with a Congolese sense of humor they have no
senses of humor at all and then fucking life is hard and they also have their
hands out like this all the time but I knew I said you know what's with you and
the Russians you guys are always so chummy close to the Russians and very
seriously he said to me because you promise us democracy and the Russians
promise us food bingo that's how the whole world works the whole world is
practical we are ideological which we only get that luxury because we are the
superpower of the world as soon as we are no longer meaning the citizens are
ideological not necessarily people running the country no the whole country
yeah yeah ideology goes all the way up everybody's trying to push their
ideology the polarization that we're seeing politically right now is really
a polarization of ideology agreed that's what and it's just it's unfortunate
because we have become so spoiled by what we have that we are now seeing the
second and third generation of people who have never actually suffered people
who have never actually wondered where the next meal is going to come from and
those people have gone all the way up to the senior ranks of government and
business and politics and everything else like you can still find people who
literally live foot-to-mouth in the United States their people below the
poverty line their people so poor they actually don't know where their next
meal is coming from there's people so poor they don't know if they're going to
eat or die next right right so they understand what it's like to feel real
suffering and need the rest of us don't that's why so many Middle Eastern
governments wealthy Middle Eastern governments are unstable because they're
so fat and so rich and so fast they got there so they got there so fast that's
true many of those countries only gained independence in 1971 in the in the
Persian Gulf they went from being deserts with palm with dates dates and
Bedouins eating camel milk and dates and then they became the richest
countries in the world world within 50 years I had a friend who was the son of
a Kuwaiti ambassador and Kuwait was my first my first overseas assignment and
he got drafted he was in his 30s and he got drafted I said drafted I didn't
even know there were any Kuwaitis in them in the Kuwaiti military he said
now there aren't there aren't many so he he had to he was a banker in Bahrain he
had to fly to Kuwait for basic training and he said that on the first day there
were like two dozen guys all Kuwaitis half of them were royal family members
on the second day they were like a dozen another dozen had just run away and the
third day it was him and two other guys and then all of the Kuwaitis were
replaced by Pakistanis you just pay him give him a couple a couple of dollars
and they'll just do your military service for you because slavery is
essentially legal yeah in the Middle East it's legal everywhere else outside
the United States it arguably it happens here in the United States and people
still turn a blind eye to it too you know why King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia was
so dark or why Prince Bandar was so dark because their mothers were Sudanese
slaves that were serving in the House of Saud really they were the illegitimate
children of slaves so so John you mentioned that we need frameworks right I
want to go back to John mentioned that we need a framework to live by to lead
by I believe that the framework that the United States lives and leads by is
the framework of change it is not a framework of rigidity and legality
there's a system of legality to support a framework of change because what we
have seen is that change is required we must adapt we must evolve we must
disrupt if you're so tied into a legalistic system that you can't change
it with the stroke of a pen right essentially what you're saying is is
the the the executive chief executive the president who is voted into office by
the people of the United States and delegates and etc etc right essentially
that person has gone through a vetting process to be given the pen that can
change the letter of the law in some cases in a moment and where he can't
change the letter of the law there's a system to support other changes whether
that's the judicial branch or the legislative branch or whatever else
that is what is our framework that is what gives us a huge advantage over many
of our of our opposition governments and countries that's why threats come and
go but the United States stays the same because our same our consistency is
being able to change to flex to meet the need and meet the threat that presents
itself so a question or comment and a question it sounds like what you're
describing is more of a European parliamentary system that's a comment
but the question that is would you support an easier way to amend the
Constitution than the way that we have now which would then affect change more
easily Steve doesn't know it but I haven't showered in three days what how's
that even possible I smell like a used gym sock on a wet dog and Satan's no no
closet I put it on before his gag reflex sets in it's Mando's whole body deodorant

comm it's linked below now back to the show I don't think the Constitution needs
to change the Constitution's built with the flexibility that we need that's I
think so absolutely wow I disagree that's why so many people have so many
people can take a stance on an argument and say that's not constitutional other
people can stand on and say we are making a change that is constitutional
like that's that healthy debate that change that argument about how it's
interpreted is the gift that our forefathers gave us that I don't really
I don't think they realized they were giving us right by writing a
Constitution that's so short that needed constant amendments you're saying the
Constitution's open to interpretation everything is open to interpretation the
whole judicial system is open to interpretation judges and attorneys can
interpret a law a different way and you are the one as the citizen of the
United States who sits on the receiving end of however they interpreted the
judge that determined that this man should go to jail a different judge in a
different court on a different day could have had a different conclusion in his
whole life would be different that's a good point right we either like that or
we don't like that and you know you know with the current makeup of the of the
Supreme Court it argues in favor of what you're saying that corporations are
people number one number two a president has the right to effectively commit
murder so long as he does it in the course of his official duties number two
I mean who would have ever thought even a year ago that we would that we would
have a conclusion like that coming from the Supreme Court but I suppose it does
matter based on the personal ideology of the members of the Supreme Court by the
courts of appeals or the objective overall right the mission overall what
is the vision that we're trying to cast if the United States's vision is truly
to lead a democratic revolution in the world and make everybody democratic
mm-hmm which is a stupid idea but one that we've been pursuing in many many
years in in lip service for a long time mm-hmm if that is the goal then that
means the United States by definition does not want to be a superpower it
wants to democratize and bring everybody up to its level and bring its own
superiority down so clearly that is not the vision mm-hmm so what is the vision
is the vision even something we're willing to say out loud because I
guarantee you that what you got on your in processing day when you went to the
bubble was the bubble there in 19 yeah when you went through your in
processing in the bubble when I went to the bubble the bubble the auditorium it's
it's got a dome over it okay at CIA it's one of the few things that you can see
even on Google Maps yeah that's right you can see the the rounded auditorium
right in front of the old headquarters building oh wow interesting we call it
the bubble okay when I went through there like day one of in processing was
signing up for health insurance yep getting we got a pseudonym that day we
got our first fake name that day I did too and then swearing in your oath of
office and then a rabble rousing speech about American primacy that's right
that's what we got that's what we got and then briefings by the head of HR the
head of security the head of this don't cheat on your time in attendance yeah
and yeah whatever yeah don't use your government credit card don't don't use
our internal systems to research yourself or your girlfriend's boyfriend that's
right so going back to cutting a little bit deeper to the point you are making
about the executive branch and you know basically being that you know a stroke of
a pen can change a law in and that can be in our favor you know geopolitically
you know throughout the world let's go to the current election that is going
down right now in United States of America what is your each of your guys
view on the current election and like how Kamala got put into office and what's
going on with Trump and what do you think about the idea which most people
believe that there was a deep conspiracy within somebody in the government to
take out Trump take him out of the election I wouldn't say most people
think that I would say that some people think that most people online are fucking
stupid but amen so so John I'm gonna let you answer first cuz I already have a
feeling we're gonna have a lot of overlap so go ahead I think we will the
deep state mm-hmm you can call it the state you can call it the federal
bureaucracy the truth is that sure in places like you know the CIA NSA FBI even
DoD among civilians are not even just civilians but even flag officers you got
people who've been in those organizations 25 30 35 years we had an
NIO for warning a national intelligence officer for warning when I was there 42
years he had an age waiver people don't get sharper no the more years they're in
government no it's not like it is in public sector that's right that's
exactly right so they know that they can wait out presidents presidents come and
go every four years every eight years these guys are there for decades if they
don't like this president they just ignore them they slow roll them yeah four
years they'll sit on that they'll do nothing do nothing do nothing and the
president's gonna go away number one number two well what we've seen happen
so far this year is not really as unusual as many Americans think look at 1968
look at 1976 but in 68 you had Lyndon Johnson a very unpopular president drop
out after the start of the primaries granted it was early the only primary
that had taken place at the time was New Hampshire he he got 67% of the vote
said oh my god I'm gonna lose and then dropped out Eugene McCarthy was the one
that that got the 33% as soon as Johnson dropped out everybody else jumped in
and Robert Kennedy senior sailed to the nomination he had enough delegates to
win it the night of the California primary he's shot and killed in the
ambassador hotel the Kennedy family asks George McGovern to stand in for the
Kennedy delegates about half remained with McGovern but Hubert Humphrey who
was vice president who nobody had voted for became the Democratic nominee okay
so not too terribly different 76 you have George I'm sorry not George W
Bush you have the Gerald Ford Gerald Ford was the house minority leader a year
and a half earlier but the vice president Spiro Agnew was indicted on on bribery
charges and so he resigned to go on trial Richard Nixon picks picks Gerald Ford
out of the House of Representatives makes him the vice president and then in
August of 74 Nixon resigns so Ford becomes president not having won a single
vote not one American voted for Ford for either president or vice president and
here he's the president of the United States so this is the system that we've
given ourselves it's not the prettiest sometimes but it's the system and it
tends to work for better or for worse so it's not so terribly and it's not a
coup like Donald Trump says it is and you know he wasted millions of dollars in
advertising he said the other night on Fox because he thought he was gonna run
against Joe Biden okay well you know what you're not running against Joe
Biden so toughen up third point is I'm not sure I think that a lot of this
Trump anti CIA anti-deep-state thing I think it's for show because Trump had
the opportunity to essentially dismantle the CIA and not only did he not do that
but he named Gina Haspel as the director Gina Haspel was a consummate
insider right you don't get any more insider than Gina Haspel like she
actually destroyed documents tapes she put him in an industrial grinder the
tapes of the torture to destroy evidence to destroy evidence after
specifically being told by Harriet Myers the White House counsel don't destroy
the tapes this is as demonstrative leak tapes we're talking about they were
evidence of the abyssal beta torture session really yeah yeah she got she
literally she got a message that said from from an email if yeah it was an
email from Jose Rodriguez yes mr. Rodriguez I've worked under mr. Rodriguez
I did too so she got an email that said destroy destroy any evidence related to
this and then she did mm-hmm like that's after there's some that's wrong on so
many levels oh my god it's a felony it's on it's wrong on so many levels and
that's the person who got placed into the director of CIA Trump by Trump you
only put someone like that in the seat of the director if you want them to do
what they're told to do there it is that's that's the purpose of somebody
that's the loyalist and then on top of Gina Haspel who does he name as the
national security advisor but John Bolton the most neoconservative pro CIA
pro covert action Republican that was even available for the job so if Trump
wanted to really make a put his stamp on the intelligence community he had
everybody fooled because he did exactly the opposite so this I mean there's a
couple of other things to keep in mind right neither of the examples from
history that John just went through are memorable to any of us that's right
exactly that's right because those candidates those politicians the
outcomes did not change they did not move the needle of history that's right
right interesting second you've also got to keep in mind the the institutional
demands that exist inside the Democratic National Convention the DNC right and
the and the representation of the political of the Democratic process in
the United States Joe Biden according to the the laws of or the the system of
the transference of power he can't nominate someone else like he has to
demonstrate his faith in the Democratic system so when he steps down there's
only one person that he can actually endorse that's exactly right and I'll
add his vice president if he were to endorse anybody else that's basically
I don't believe in the Democratic system yeah scandal because if he's shot if he's
shot or if he has a heart attack or if he's lost in some tragic accident guess
where the country falls just like right falls to her anyway so he has to follow
that process just to demonstrate his loyalty to the Democratic system that's
right and I'll add one thing the Republican Party is far far more likely
to nominate an outsider than the Democrats are the Democrats have have made
their system so that it is impossible for an upstart or an outsider to win the
Democratic nomination in 1972 Richard Nixon was afraid of running against Edmund
Muskie Muskie had been the senior senator from Maine and he was the chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee everybody loved Ed Muskie he was the vice
presidential nominee for the Democrats in 68 with Hubert Humphrey he later
actually became Secretary of State under Jimmy Carter but anyway Nixon was
worried about Muskie and he was worried about Kennedy but then Kennedy killed
Mary Jo Kepekny and well he killed Mary Jo Kepekny and Kennedy didn't run in in
72 so Ed Muskie is a threat to Richard Nixon so Nixon had the plumbers you know
the plumbers mm-hmm spread a rumor about Muskie's wife and Muskie gave this
famous press conference in the snow and the fact that it was snowing becomes
important in New Hampshire where he defends his wife now the conventional
wisdom is that he began crying in this press conference he says that a snowflake
landed on his cheek right under his eye and melted and it looked like it it
looked like a tear okay you look at it he's clearly crying because he's so
insulted that his wife was insulted they called her a whore and all kinds of
stuff and everybody's like oh my god Ed Muskie's a crybaby we can't nominate him
for president and so he drops out of the race then you've got Eugene McCarthy
saying hey remember me I got a third of the vote against Linda Johnson four
years ago people are like yeah but you're kind of a closet communist and
you're a hippie and we can't do you either and so George Wallace is like
what about me I'm a Democrat now you hate black people and you're a racist we
can't nominate you and all these Democrats are jumping in and then
George McGovern all of a sudden starts winning delegates nobody wanted George
McGovern to be the Democratic nominee that's what you're seeing happening with
Kamala Harris right now exactly the president stepped down he only has one
choice he has to endorse the vice president he has to and then the
Democratic National Convention so that there's party there's no George McGovern
the party can't stand opposite of the Democratic process so where the fuck
else are the delegates like who's not gonna support Kamala Harris of the party
precisely so the delegates all say yes all the other all the other people who
were trying to run for Democratic ticket they're all gonna say yes because
they don't want to be blacklisted and not get to run in the future mm-hmm the
American people haven't had a chance to vote yet and this is why the Democrats
created the system of superdelegates right after 72 they said there will never
be another George McGovern we're gonna make these superdelegates so every
Democratic elected official at the federal level and every Democrat in the
state party apparatuses will automatically become Democrats and they
will by their very nature endorse the party candidate so Kamala Harris Kamala
Harris was already nominated what yesterday I think it was or the day
before in a zoom call seriously front page of today's New York Times so the
convention next week is just for show now now let's take this conversation back
to where John and I started mm-hmm are we ideologically driven by rule of law no
or are we just promising one thing and doing something different on the back
end right and that's what's happening right now is the American that the
opinion of the American people is being shaped in favor of Kamala Harris yes
right because she doesn't have anything of her own to stand on three weeks ago
she was polling lower than Joe Biden yeah today she's ever was a democratic part
right it's crazy how the public opinion has shifted and the media has shifted the
public opinion has not shifted yet there is no voice to the public opinion yet
because they haven't cast a vote that's what's so fucking important dude right
but you're right talking about the media the amount of advertising here's here's
the thing that makes me laugh the most when you look up anti-Harris videos when
you're on YouTube anybody on YouTube who hasn't seen this I don't know where
you're I don't know what YouTube you're watching you'll find videos that are
that are talking about why Kamala Harris shouldn't be president can't be president
whatever else and as soon as you click play the first ad you're gonna see is a
pro-Harris ad right oh my god not only is their advertising so sloppy not only
are they just pushing as much out there as they can because they have a hundred
hundred million dollars in the bank for the Biden-Harris campaign right it's
really easy to make ads for Kamala Harris because they're they're like they
they're just b-roll they're b-roll and her saying a message right it's much
harder for people to do anything for Trump yes let's let's test this right now
let's watch this right now yeah that's what yeah we got we don't have we don't
have oh he's already I already searched her oh he's on premium so I just type
in 2024 presidential ad and Kamala Harris is the what so we we should search
for just Kamala Harris right do a search do a search for something like Kamala
Harris should not be president okay see what yeah see what comes up okay why
Kamala Harris should never be present now let's click on that and I want to see
what the ad is so there's not gonna be an ad I'm on premium we're on YouTube
son of a bitch you just can you sign out of premium is there a way I can find
the okay there we go yeah so your point your point is like if they were
actually paying attention they wouldn't be targeting hate hater hater videos on
her exactly that's the one person you're not gonna convert right so there's
clearly just we need to blow as much money as possible right and we need to
pump it out quickly because what do they know is happening they know that the
Trump campaign is changing all of their messaging now to attack Kamala Harris
which is why you're not seeing a lot of Trump ads you're not seeing a lot of
anti-Harris ads because they're working on them they're making them yeah and you
can't they're in production you can't come out with one ad every week you need
to come out with like 12 ads at the same time so that you and I and all the
American people see the same ad so I'm saying that because public opinion is
currently being shaped and this is how it is being shaped by the process that we
have made our electoral process right we have made it so that the far left and
far right have already made their decisions it's all the unnamed voters in
the middle who have yet to decide and up until three weeks ago their decision
was between two old white men you're absolutely right and you know you go on
you go on a lot of these sites I do this every year just for fun just to see
what the result is going to be the libertarian party always has one of
these Q&A things where they'll they'll ask you about all the major issues of the
day you click on what your position is and then they'll they'll place you on a
on a graph to show you are you progressive are you conservative are
you libertarian are you statist and they'll they'll tell you which candidate
you most closely align with I consider myself to be a part of the libertarian
left right mm-hmm and I always always always match almost perfectly with the
libertarians always not with the Democrats or the Republicans and then
second is like usually you know the Greens or something like that but everybody
should do that you know I remember I mean voting your conscience I know right
everybody should vote their country you know what they say the lesser of two
evils is still evil it's true it's true but all of that is to say that that what
you're seeing right now Americans are interpreting the support of delegates
and the support of delegates the support of donors the support of
whatever the influx of donations they're interpreting that to be support and unity
mm-hmm behind a candidate right it is not no it's not it is a practiced
behavior expected of you to survive inside the Democratic National
Convention's system if you violate their system you will be taken out of that
system and you will not have a chance in the future and interestingly the
Democratic system of nominating a candidate is far less Democratic with a
small d than the Republicans yeah far far less you don't have a choice like you
unless you are registered and identified and groomed and invested and show loyalty
and have a history of whatever like mm-hmm you don't even get the opportunity
sounds like a cult yeah yeah it does doesn't it Yachty John you made a point
earlier that Trump was very seemed to be pro CIA working with the CIA when he was
president last time yeah do you think that he is going to be sort of pro
establishment that is I think he's still on that trajectory ever since the
assassination attempt I think probably less so there's been there have been
rumors lately that if he wins he he's considering naming Rick Grinnell as the
CIA director who's that Rick Grinnell is an odd character he's a fundraiser he's
openly gay he was nominated not even nominated he was he was ambassador to
Germany the Germans hated him threatened to expel him there he is and now
there's talk that if Trump wins he'll end up as either national security
advisor director of national intelligence or CIA director I've met
Grinnell a couple times he's teaching a class over at George Washington University
right now yeah he's not a guy that I'd necessarily like to hang out with but I
could think of a lot worse people you know to be considered for a position like
that so the other thing to keep in mind is don't mistake Donald Trump wanting to
have the CIA as him being pro CIA that's a good point it could just be pro
capability because you get when you're the president CIA is in your back pocket
yeah like the branch that CIA falls under is the executive branch so it's like
the toy that sits on the shelf that you play with only when you want to whereas
if you throw away the toy you don't ever get the toy but with CIA comes a whole
suite of capabilities that's right and a whole a whole building of people that
can't say no because without you they have no purpose or job right if anything
the massive attrition that CIA has been experiencing since 2016 when Trump won
the election was when people really started waking up at the agency started
waking up to the fact that we serve the president we don't serve the American
people mm-hmm we don't serve the democratic process we serve at the
behest of the president the pleasure of the president so wherever that person
goes we follow I think some people didn't like that I think most Americans
don't understand that CIA is one of those very very unusual organizations where
we're serving at the behest of the president actually means something I
remember when I first got hired there were old-timers still talking about a
station chief in the Middle East who had been fired by Ronald Reagan because he
was living in sin with his girlfriend the Reagan had made a trip to the Middle
East there was a dinner at the COS's house the COS's Chief of Stations house
the the chief said like to like for you mr. president to meet my my girlfriend
oh are you visiting oh no mr. president I live here oh you're fired I don't allow
my people to live in sin you can't do that in the rest of the civil service but
at the CIA we served at the pleasure of the president and if he doesn't like the
cut of your jib or the way you look at him in the meeting you're out so now
you understand why someone like Gina Haspel would be a good call because
that's a person who does what they're told to do right so when a call comes
down at 2 o'clock in the morning on a Sunday to get something illegal or
potentially illegal done mm-hmm that's the kind of person who says yes I was on
Fox News last week on the waters Jesse Jesse Waters show and he asked me about
that specifically and I said you know this is why if if Donald Trump wins the
presidency again and if I had the opportunity to tell him one thing it
would be please don't choose a general or a CIA insider to lead the CIA because
the way those people became generals and became senior intelligence service
leaders was by saying yes sir mm-hmm through their all careers yes sir what
you need is somebody who has the guts to say mr. president that's a terrible
idea and let me tell you why and I think this is what we should do instead
mm-hmm somebody who's got the guts to tell the president the truth right but
it's counterintuitive because that's not the way it is our in the government
exactly right and that's that's what's so difficult and anybody who's ever served
in uniform anybody who's still serving in uniform anybody who's ever been in
any kind of bureaucratic process that's tied to tied to government what they
have seen is your first your your new tranche of recruits every year are full
of zest and zeal and ideology and passion for what they believe it means to
serve the public exactly right and then as every year goes by they are ground
down to a more mediocre average and then the people who are still have burrs on
their shoulders the people who are still a little bit ornery either find their way
out or they get kicked out or they're pulled out in some way and once you
get to the senior most levels of decision-making those people have already
like there's a there's a turning point between like seven and twelve years where
you really have so true where you really have to make your decision am I gonna
make a life out of this so true or am I gonna pull parachute and get out of this
and old timer told me by year 10 you can see who's gonna be a leader and who's
not and the ones who aren't are gonna leave and it has nothing to do with
leadership no it has to do with whether you're gonna follow the bureaucratic
process I mean we call it riding coattails yeah we call it having
grandfather rabbi yep let me tell you a quick story and I've told you this
story but it's important and and it bears repeating so when I was still in
analysis this would have been the mid 1990s the office that I had worked for
the office of leadership analysis ceased to exist while I was serving overseas
so Clinton under yes Bill Clinton so I came back and I was assigned to the
office of Near Eastern and South Asian analysis one of the group chiefs which
was a GS 15 you know the the general service scale goes up to 15 and then
above that is the senior intelligence service one of the GS 15 deputy group
chiefs was John Brennan John was he was you know it was a mid-level nobody a
mid-level functionary what year was this this was 1996 96 he was a GS 15 yeah
wow which is actually the point of the story so there was nothing special about
John you know he had a BA from Fordham in history nothing special about this guy
at all and he worked for a woman named Martha Kessler and Martha was something
special she was the US government's acknowledged expert on Syria and had
written the definitive book on Syria called Syria fragile mosaic of power
and everybody had to read Martha's book when you got assigned to Nisa so
Christmas of 1996 I remember this like it was yesterday he goes to Martha and he
says Martha I've been your deputy for whatever it was four years five years I
think I'm ready for the senior intelligence service and I want your
blessing to apply for XYZ job she said I don't like you I've never liked you and
you will never be in the senior intelligence service in fact you're
fired mm-hmm so at the agency you're not really fired if you're shuffled yeah
you're shuffled so if they tell you you're fired you have six weeks to walk
the halls and find another job and if you can't find a job in six weeks then
you're fired okay it's Christmas time the normal job turnover is in the summer
so there are no jobs at Christmas over vacation so Brennan is going office to
office to office looking for a job he finds one opening it's in the president's
daily brief the PDB staff and for analysts you know if you're serious about analysis
you're gonna end up in the PDB staff eventually either as a briefer or as an editor they have
one opening and it's for the lowest level it's to brief the lowest level person
entitled to a PDB briefing and that is the national security council's director for
intelligence programs who at the time happened to be George Tennant so you know
John is this short squat ugly pock face dude and George is a short squat ugly pock face dude
tell me how you really feel John yeah both chomping on cigars I won't get into their
personal lives but they're equally disgusting um so Brennan goes down to the White House
introduces himself to George they immediately hit it off now George had just had a heart attack
so he promised his wife he wouldn't smoke well there used to be a kiosk at the corner of 17th
and Pennsylvania Avenue it's not there anymore and the guy sold magazines and newspapers and
cigars and gum and stuff like that so they would do the briefing at the White House
walk over to the kiosk smoke a cigar George would go back to the White House and John would go back
to the agency next thing you know George is named deputy CIA director so he calls Brennan
and he makes Brennan the deputy director of the office of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis
Martha Kessler's boss and he calls Martha in on his on his first day and he says now you're fired
and so she was gone she packed up her shit and she left so no we never saw her again
next thing you know there's a realignment and I mean he was only in the job for like six weeks
there's a realignment and they merged a bunch of offices and there was a more senior guy
who took John's job so George made John he says listen you're going places with me so I'm going
to make you station chief in Riyadh direct line of communication between the the director of the
CIA and the king himself and he's there for like five years well this also gives him operational
experience which he had never had so then he comes back from Riyadh they make him the executive
director of the CIA the third ranking officer in the entire CIA and then from there he becomes the
head of the national counterterrorism center the first one by the way then he becomes the deputy
national security advisor for counterterrorism then he becomes the director of the CIA does
anybody remember yeah yeah does anybody remember Martha Kessler or know what she's doing
there's some really important lessons here yes right that that are absolutely worth highlighting
one this is the way our government works what is true in CIA is true in department of state is true
in department of energy is true in the department of the interior the dni the you know dhs fbi
and everybody who's in those worlds knows it and everybody who's not in those worlds thinks
that somehow we promote from within based on meritorious service and outstanding accomplishment
and outstanding achievement and that the american government gets this reputation in movies and
books that somehow these organizations are super elite right we are not the most talented people
leave or get forced out because the only way that you climb to the top is by becoming a company
person by acknowledging and accepting and being grandfathered and godfathered it's not
based on your meritorious service it's not based on what you accomplish it's based on who you know
and the politics within each building and your ability to work within those politics and this
is a fantastic example of the director of cia when like the leadership of that role
fired a recognized expert that could actually move the dial to benefit american national
security interests but out of personal spite yeah center somewhere else there's a famous quote by
gamal abdelnas or the the president of egypt i actually printed it and i had it hanging at my
desk and i and i was able to verify that he actually said this it's it's not apocryphal
he said the thing about you americans is you never make clear cut stupid decisions you always make
complicated stupid decisions which makes us wonder if there is something to them which
we are missing right and it's because these are the people yes making the stupid decisions so you
and that's a great quote because you also have to look at it through the eyes of of arab culture
arabic culture whether it's caligia or otherwise is so calculated and so careful
that there's an intent and a purpose behind everything right they're they're very very these
are people who had to survive in the desert so they're somehow both hospitable and ruthless
there's a level of patience and then there's a point where you pass you cross that line of
patience and they never show you like they're expert negotiators because they never show
what they're actually thinking when they see us through their eyes they think that we must also
be expert negotiators experts at hiding something and and when we do these nonsensical things
that seem stupid they think it's just so smart they can't figure it out yes when it's really just
stupid i remember when when saddam said you began pulling out of kuit you know george
george hw bush said the clock is ticking you know february 2nd we're going to start bombing
and then on the first saddam started withdrawing from kuit i remember yasser arafat giving a press
conference and just saying genius genius because he figured he can't be actually withdrawing right
there has to be some incredibly deep military strategy here no he was just withdrawing yeah i
think i think china may have figured it out that we're just fucking stupid sometimes good point
right because as soon as we left afghanistan they swept right into afghanistan and started signing
deals and everything else so it's not like they thought there was some kind of long-term strategic
play there they were like oh nope america's just leaving behind half a pie and we're gonna go eat
the shit out of that pie right whereas everybody else is looking at it like there's something wrong
with that pie they poisoned it or something right there's no way they're leaving yeah yeah oh yeah
you've you've hit that on the head so it's just it's frustrating because you know went from the
outside looking in we see that happening for these internal services and america doesn't know that
that's the truth of it and at the same time i still very much love cia and the mission of cia and
the purpose of cia and it's the work that those people are doing is is incredibly important
incredibly relevant incredibly powerful so i still want to encourage people who want to go down that
road to go down that road but at the same time bail the fuck out when when you've been able to
serve a year or four years or six years or eight years or ten years when you run into that wall
mm-hmm get out get out and go do something else with the talent that you have because you will
start to believe that you are not good enough if you stay inside because you'll end up being
gaslit by the system and that's part of the culture in the cia is the longer you're there
the more the culture convinces you that you can't do anything else yeah your your skills are so unique
your training is so specific you can't do anything else yeah and that's just simply not true yeah and
it's it's it's sad it's sad to see it from the outside but at the same time i also understand
that it's it's required because we need the best people in the world to get in there
okay what do you guys make of this shooter that shot donald trump do you think that he was just
some lone idiot or do you think that this was a intentional gap left in security by the secret
service so i'm gonna i'll go first on this john because there's there's a i i see this
occam's razor i see this as shit happens so you think like shit happens okay if you're gonna look
at this instance and you're gonna look at it with any kind of statistical relevancy you have to look
at every public presentation by every politician over the last 300 to 3000 public presences right
where the secret service was in charge of security when you put this against a statistically relevant
number you realize this is the exception that all those all those public appearances all those
speeches all those presentations where there was no active danger where there was no threat where
there was no nothing that the american people knew about that was the secret service doing a good
job at the time whereas what happened in in butler pennsylvania is different it's different because
what people don't want to accept is that there's always gaps always there's it's never perfect
there's always a chance for tragedy there's always the opportunity for a perfect storm
it's just that we happen to see it this time is it always the case though in these situations where
the actual counter sniper has a scope on the guy with a gun on the roof that's like 200 yards away
that's part of the bureaucracy you got to ask this guy for permission to shoot and then that guy has
to ask the chief for permission to shoot and by then you know the sniper's already shot right
that's people don't like to accept it but they have to accept it that there is a process
there's a process because here's here's the thing if the sniper on the roof were to have seen
who the fuck knows a little old lady who's chasing her cat up a wall if he blows the head
off an 85 year old lady who's chasing her cat that's fucking a nightmare right and that's not
something that people that's again a demonstration of the incompetence of the secret service so
there's a process call something in get something approved i don't know what the process is for
secret service but they don't just get to make autonomous decisions right but i think the guy
even said during the when they were getting questioned by congress is that the sniper asked
like two minutes before yeah that he told them that is whoever the next person the chain of
command was that he had the guy on the roof saw that he had a gun and they still denied him like
it's not like it was a guy on the on the roof eating cotton candy right it was a guy on the
roof with a rifle you know the la times had a very interesting op-ed about this the day or two days
after it happened and they said we've so convinced ourselves that the secret service is the secret
service that we see in films right right they're they're all supermen they really are and they're
expert marksmen and they're smart and they're athletic and they're out there just doing god's
work in fact these are the guys that you know went to columbia with the president and all got
prostitutes and then didn't didn't pay them and got in trouble and then one guy left his badge
and his gun in the hotel room with the prostitute by accident they're idiots they have their heads
up their asses half of them he said uh these are the guys who when obama was president a guy climbed
over the white house fence ran all the way to the door to the front door white house got inside
the white house right and it was a woman in there or something he got he got halfway up the steps
you know into the the residential quarters so why wasn't he stopped because the guy in the booth
thought that the guy at the fence was gonna stop him the guy at the fence missed him and said well
the canine's gonna get him the canine guy didn't get him because he was on the phone with his
girlfriend and then the guy inside said i don't want to get him because the dog is gonna come
and i don't want the dog to bite me shit happens shit happens we're not bullet proof now that you
realize hopefully now that every now the world is hopefully waking up the world that listens to
danie jones is hopefully waking up to the fact that there is not a promotional cycle of meritocracy
inside so good people don't go up the chain nope yes and on top of that you've got this inherent
bureaucracy that makes every decision needs three other people to sign off on it and the process
that's in place nobody wants to get caught you know with their hands in the cookie jar or breaking
the process or whatever else so that slows everything down so now you have a bit of a
competency question with a guaranteed timeliness question and then on top of that you have to
add in the variables that come from the actual person or the threat in the case of the butler
county shooting the threat themselves and what the threat intends to do and the capacity and
capability of the threat all of those things go into every situation right it's just it's the
nature of the game it's not just secret service it's also fbi it's also special operations it's
also cia it's also nro like the most elite organizations out there are still built on the
backs of people now i'm not going to say they're all what you you made a a statement i made a
generalization that's probably not fair that's harsh so i'm not going to say they've all got
their heads up their ass or anything like that they are hardworking people trying to do the right
thing but they also know that if they do the wrong bureaucratic thing their career is over
right yeah totally understood about the people who work within the secret service so what's more
likely a second secret shooter and a great conspiracy that was devised by the democratic
party and kept hush hush and we still haven't discovered and they farmed it out to a 20 year old
right as a patsy right is that more likely or is it more likely that maybe somebody didn't answer
a walkie-talkie call fast enough and they didn't coordinate closely enough with the show with the
local sheriff and the sheriff's deputies and as a result of that some fucking whack job got on a
roof and shot a gun what's more likely yeah see i don't know i've been going back and forth this
in my head ever since it happened i don't know what it's been like almost three weeks now right
and it just seems like with all the footage that was released and then let's just like take a
little time machine and go back in time and look at all the shit that truck i mean i'm looking at
from the perspective of just like a citizen who doesn't have any experience in the government
or working for cia we see donald trump getting shot at before that you have all these trials
they're dragging him through before that you have all of the other things that are coming out with
like the stormy daniel stuff before that you have the the hunter biden laptop story which was
signed a literally 51 cia agent signed a piece of paper saying that it was disinformation and these
are like apparently like legitimate high level oh i worked with i worked with 40 of them right
yeah signing off that it was dis info when we find out in fact it wasn't right they knew it
so they were all hoping listen at that level everybody wants to be cia director
national security advisor or secretary of defense and that was their effort to suck up to joe biden
hoping that they could cash in on it later i hate to i hate to sound like that but that's the way it
works that's just the way it is that's the way it works john brennan you know i'll tell you another
thing about john brennan um he was in this cohort of people who a very senior people who
retired all around the same time and half of them went to the um to the john mccain campaign
and half of them went to the hillary clinton campaign and he was literally the only one who
went to obama the only one and he saved himself and then after obama won he told everybody who
would listen that he wanted to be the secretary of defense because that's just the way it is
you keep moving up higher and higher and higher and higher and then you get the six million
dollar book advance and then you get a center at some university named after you and you appear on
the news networks and you live happily ever after that's what they all have as a goal why this is
i mean it's important to understand the why okay what what john is saying is right and that's
there's no way that's going to deny it there's nobody that's going to tell the truth and deny it
you don't get to be s is too because you're so dedicated to so smart american you work long
hours and you're so smart yeah you get there because you know that the only other option
besides going up the chain is to stay mid-level or senior enough that at retirement hopefully you
get to hold on to 50 percent of your base pay when you retire that's right because you're and
and i mean top tier salaries at cia top tier salaries right now it's here probably 170
yeah 180 so when you you're not doing it for the money so so 20 or 30 years let's just say you serve
for 30 years plenty of people serve for 30 years they start when they're 24 they retire at 54 they
were making $170,000 they built a lifestyle for $170,000 they're 50 years old which means they've
got kids in college they've got a spouse who's probably still working and now their salary
gets cut in half so now they go from making $170,000 a year to making 85 $85,000 a year
but they have a hundred and seventy thousand dollar lifestyle living in northern virginia and felt
way and five or ten years of mortgage payments left yep so what are they gonna do what are they
gonna do you become a contractor right you flip your clearance into something else and this is
something trump tried to stop right that's something some tried to stop but but the only other option
you have besides flipping it into a contract is to get the book deal to become some spokesperson
for a news origin like you have to have something to carry you because you can't live off of $85,000
a year on $170,000 your lifestyle and you have no future plan you have a tsp where you've stashed
away three and a half percent every year that's it through savings and you can't touch it until
you're 67 or something 67 right so it's a it's a financial reality that that government employees
have to play by the rules after about year 12 if they have any hopes of building the next
round of income when they retire whereas anybody who leaves you have many many more options in
the commercial sector because you can build your own product build your own business you can
invest your money in five or seven different ways you can make more money in less time
so it's it's just that's why the people who stay in oftentimes are they end up being these
shells of kind of mediocre performers right because they have become so focused on just how
to survive how to survive now and how to survive later they still want to do the right thing they're
still public servants but they're also trying to deal with divorces and trying to deal with kids
going through school and trying to go with like it's not easy man with two and a half weeks of
vacation a year is private would you say private intelligence is more effective than traditional
government cia intelligence no not more effective no it's got benefits but it's not more effective
it it's relying essentially on open source intelligence press and the cia does that anyway
okay there's also an element with private intelligence where they can do things that
that can't be sanctioned by the government but they also don't have the resources or the training
or the talent pool to pull from which is how you end up having a bunch of contractors or captured
on the on the bank of that's it or exactly right they you don't have the protection from risk
you know that black passport that says diplomat at the top of it that's the worldwide get out of
jail free card and if you're private forget it you're on your own right that's why they make a
ton of money at venezuela but they take a ton of risk yeah speaking of venezuela
i just had a guy in the podcast uh two weeks ago john perkins he wrote a book called economic
hitman yeah he's a great interview confessions of an economic hitman and he had a job with the
consulting company to go around the world to i guess it was poor countries and convince them
that they needed loans from the world bank or the imf imf or whatever it was the united states
would give them these massive loans that they knew they could never pay back and in return we
would say oh that's fine just you know we'll take your resources and he was explaining to me
that china figured out how this wasn't working especially when countries started to go i forget
i think it was ecuador is one of the ones that said no argentina argentina we had argentina by
the balls and then you know conveniently the the presidents of panama and i think ecuador got
killed in plane crashes and what he was explaining is that china's figured out this loophole and
figured out where we messed up in this whole situation so they can go in and basically give
them money with no strings attached and and they could get to come in there build roads but you
know the whole belt and road thing building you know airports whatever is there chinese influence
in venezuela or no very little very little okay and and in the it's in the oil sector you know
the thing about venezuela traditionally we we used to have good relations with venezuela
they used to be a rich country they used to be very very successful right the the largest um proven
oil reserves in the world now but the thing is venezuelan oil is very very dirty it has
unusually high levels of sulfur in it and there are only two places where you can refine that
oil texas and now china and the chinese just built a refinery in the caribbean so really for decades
yeah they own a big chunk of the caribbean islands yeah it's true and that's just in the last 20 years
what island did they build the refinery on oh i knew this i wrote it i wrote it up and i don't
remember anymore so it's important what john just said in the last 20 years what has america been
doing for the last 20 years yeah a war fighting wars that's it that's right that's where our money
is gone yep and the chinese were smart to that that's why you know i i was in china i guess let me
think i was there in april the first time i've ever been no it's caribbean islands owned by china
caribbean island oil refinery everything is brand spanking new glittering gleaming cities it's
incredible their airports are our first class the shopping it's their roads are beautiful
and then you come here you fly into jfk and you're like what jfk is hell on earth it's awful
jay is it worth in miami oh my gosh oh there's no comparison really oh no i'll take miami
it's pretty bad leguario has hope jfk is a shit show i have no idea how new yorkers do it it's
stunning thank god for uwr and for so many travelers like that's their first glimpse of the united
states you know you land and you're like seriously well it feels like the rest it feels like a third
world country it does so i mean it does they they are landing in a place that feels like home
st croix st croix yep st croix 2022 venezuela is completely different and what's happening
there is totally different you you you can't look at venezuela without looking through the lens of
its history of strongman leaderships right going back to like the late 90s when chavez took over
that that place had it is a playground for influence operations for every major player in
the world right but it's totally unpredictable you have no idea what's going to happen there all you
know for sure is that there's going to be some sort of of central government play catering to
poor people to make them take action on something they don't understand that's venezuela that there's
no proxy war there no there's no civil war there's worse though is is sanctions you know we've
been sanctioned the living shit out of them right yeah we sanctioned the living shit out of anybody
we don't like everybody and we've overplayed that here for sure because now people are like you know
what fuck your sanctions and that's what we're gonna go to the chinese right bingo right all of our all
our sanctions have done our sanctions combined with a 20-year global war on terror have allowed a
competitor in the marketplace to rise up so now if you don't like american financial work
or financial systems you can choose chinese financial systems if you don't like american
weapon systems you can choose russian or chinese weapon systems if you don't like american
telecommunications you can choose chinese telecommunications you don't like american
made vehicles you can choose chinese made vehicles china's done a fantastic job of
getting themselves to a place right where they are a viable alternative to the united states
for every sector for developing nations yeah it's it's not first class first world stuff
but it is absolutely good enough for the third world absolutely true what was the story are
yes i'm sure you guys are familiar with the 2020 story where there was like a boat of like
mercenaries that went up when a shore in venezuela that's what we're talking about yep
the piglets yeah but yeah private contractors who were hired to do a very dangerous thing
underfunded probably you know probably trained adequately i heard that they were backed by the
us no probably not if they were it was through a series yeah cutouts cutouts okay got it so
essentially the reason and and it's hard to navigate like why elon musk is you know in yeah
he's been obsessed with venezuela the last two weeks so why is that because he's elon musk guys
elon musk is a fantastic example of say shit all the time and when you're right everybody's like
oh my gosh elon musk is a genius he predicted this right and when you're wrong everyone forgets
my favorite my favorite example is ever is arnold schwarznecker arnold schwarznecker
did an interview once where the interviewer was like you know mr schwarznecker you've
done a lot of movies and and why have you done so many bad movies and he was like
because nobody remembers my bad movies but i had to do a lot of movies to get enough good
movies that people remember there you go and when you think about it right what movies do you
remember arnold schwarznecker in and i'll bet you have movies that just rattle off in your brain
right sure big big name movies terminator yeah he was also in a bunch of bad movies can you list
more than two of his bad movies nobody can and that's that's the human experience elon musk is
just a he's a fucking autistic dude right who understands the math behind it right so he just
talks about whatever is on his mind at the time and eventually it either turns out to be right
and everybody gives him credit for it or it's wrong and nobody notices or remembers so we
essentially are only interested in there being a dictatorship in venezuela is because we want the
oil we want to i think trump in am i right is that when trump was president there was a guy who
was running against maduro wasn't he wasn't even an actual candidate one guido he was a graduate
student at george washington university this is this was fucking john bolton's genius idea
they didn't like they didn't like the result of the election now one of the things that people
forgot is the likes of um the national association of attorneys uh the carter center the united
nations they sent election observers just like they did last week to venezuela yeah and they said
yeah there were a couple of problems but not enough problems to change the outcome of the election
for you know all intents and purposes it was fair enough and legal enough we don't like that at
least as fair as ours right yeah seriously so they said no no we recognize one guido one guido this
kid from from gw university is going to be the new president of venezuela and then of course we
bully the european union to jump in and say yes yes we recognize one guido well one guido didn't
know anything about running venezuela in fact i remember a public opinion poll poll where most
venezuelans didn't know who one guido was most venezuelans don't know much though yeah well that's
true although they're very good at kidnapping they live in the columbia yes so um i remember john
john bolton uh taking questions in a press conference where one of the reporters said but
mr bolton what about the permission in the venezuelan constitution that says that if the president
doesn't take the oath of office between within 30 days of the election that he's no longer the
president and bolton was like because he had never read the venezuelan constitution it said we just
wanted to impose this guy this is going to be our guy whether you like it or not and one guido never
went back to uh he's in washington a week ago i saw him at some think tank so i don't so i mean i
want to i want to come back to this john because you you just use the correct word the correct word
about how the united states engaged yeah um about how the united states engages with the un would you
grab me one yep thanks and you said that they we went in and we bullied the un to get them on our
side thank you oh it doesn't matter so again go so you have made you have made some significant
decisions in your life sure based on principles and ideology but you know that the united states
bullies we bully the un we bullied nato we choose which court system we use to approve whatever
illegal process or whatever seemingly questionable process we need i just i don't understand why you
would gamble with your life the way that you have gambled with your life knowing what the
fuck you know man i know right why would you do that like yeah i know what i can i often ask myself
the same question what the fuck man you know i really believed at the time that somebody
was going to say something because i remember seeing these cables coming back from the secret
sites mostly from oms people office of medical services mostly from oms people saying look i
took an oath to do no harm i'm not doing this you know we had we used to call the doctors
that were reviving up as a beta so that he could be tortured more we used to call them
dr mengelah right oh dr mengelah is out at the site and then we had we had nurses that would
that were fainting during the torture sessions we had people curtailing their their assignments
curtail if you curtail an assignment you send a cable to headquarters saying i'm not doing this
anymore i'm coming home that's a career ending decision and i mean we're talking about a dozen
people and i thought well surely somebody's gonna say something and then nobody did and
then there was there was one woman i i think i'm not going to say her name because she never
said she never admitted that it was her but there was one woman who was escorted out of the
white house her badge was taken senior intelligence service and she was told never to come back
because they believed that she had blown the whistle on the secret prisons and i thought wow
she's got some balls that was really a brave thing to do she knew what they were going to do
they're going to take her pension they're going to prosecute her they didn't because
if she did it she was extraordinarily discreet i wasn't discreet and really the the mistake that
i made i'm i don't regret taking on the agency i regret not engaging an attorney before taking
the agency that was really a critical mistake that i made if i had had somebody skilled in
whistleblower defense or even criminal defense sitting next to me like the a-listers that i had
after the fact i think the whole thing would have turned out differently plus you know i had
strange things happened uh consequently two of the fbi agents that were involved in my arrest
after i went to prison called my lead attorney and and apologized and said that that they were
ordered to do it it was a political case they had to do what they were told
that meant a lot to me i got an email from a retired ddci deputy director of central intelligence
a guy that i had the greatest respect for the day after i did it he emailed me and he said
you've chosen a difficult road i'm glad that somebody did i only wish i had had the guts
to do it myself and that just meant everything to me and i thought you know what one of my
lawyers said something he said this this case is you're you're stuck on the fact that it's you
involved in this case he said this case is so much bigger than you people aren't gonna remember you
they're gonna remember that somebody stood up to the torture program and so it was worth it
it was worth it and another thing too and maybe this is getting a little too personal
but you really get to see who your friends are oh yeah i'm sure and they're not the people you
think they are so it's it's interesting because you know you and i didn't overlap at the agency
no i left in thanks i left in 2004 four yeah and i came in 2007 my my resignation was effective
in 2005 right but the one charge that that stuck for you for the disclosure of a of a secret
identity right right um the intelligence identities protection act right was deuce martinez no it
wasn't deuce no no oh somebody else the name was never made public ah see this is the thing about
deuce martinez they charged me with espionage saying that i outed deuce martinez deuce martinez is
on fucking linkedin central intelligence agency targeting officer right it's like well you charged
me with espionage the guy's on fucking linkedin and then he gave a speech at jmu i think it was
james madison university what it's a day in the life of a cia uh targeting officer and they're
like uh okay we'll drop the chart so it's just it's interesting to me because uh so deuce went on to
become one of the fund those the foundational trainers for myself and for my wife uh my wife
was a targeting officer for cia it was and deuce was her mentor so after meeting him and knowing
what resulted as a result of him being tied to the torture for abu zubeda yeah right like
that was just it was it was frustrating to know that there was a connection there that was made
public you know he left the agency just after i did i went to the private sector uh to one of the
big four consulting firms and deuce went to mitchell and jesson he he had been he had applied for a job
at like i think it was ibm there wasn't an analysis job at ibm he and i used to get together for
lunch every week after we both left and um he would call me with these updates all the time
about the negotiations with i i'm pretty sure it was ibm and he called me to say hey let's have
lunch i decided to take a job and i said hey great this was going to be big money for him
so we get together for lunch at tyson's gallery of right the chinese place and he hands me a
business card and it says mitchell and jesson llc and i said are you out of your fucking mind
you're gonna work for these monsters seriously and he said no you're wrong about them they're
good guys they're patriots i said they're fucking the creators of the torture program
i said how many times have we talked about this how many times like into the middle of the night
in pakistan have we talked about how we were hoping that they would do the right thing
and he's like yeah what the money it was so good it's such great money and i said man i think
you're out of your mind and then once i went public he never spoke to me again which was no big loss
because he was on the wrong side of that i mean regardless of what you think about deus like he
went on to make he changed some lives for people who were coming up in the ranks he changed my
wife's life yeah he's done some fantastic work good but the thing is also i mean this this is
this is where principle and and and practicality start to separate right because the torture
program was sanctioned when it was initiated yes and the men and women who did the did the duties
execute the job and execute the duties that were assigned to them as they swore in their oath
like they know they didn't sleep well either sure i understand that but in their oath they they
swore to uphold the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic and it was a legal
program that they were assigned to carry out and you already said what the if they curtailed their
but wasn't legal because no court ever ruled that it was legal no court they said it was too highly
classified to even present to a court so just take our word for it that's what that's what you and
byby's conclusion was so the this is i find that this is very similar to the argument for Edward
Snowden and Snowden's quote unquote whistleblowing right and what oftentimes becomes the argument
for whistleblowers in general whistleblowers are protected and they should be protected some are
when they do things the right way oh no no to your point oh no no no what about the case of
tom drake i don't know tom drake tom drake was a senior intelligence service officer at nsa
he um his first day was september 11th 2001 he had been a a full colonel in the air force
there's tom drake and um he became aware immediately after 9 11 of uh of the plan to
to initiate warrantless wiretapping of american citizens so there was a competing software program
that nsa had developed that would weed out us persons and target only suspect uh numbers
and uh general Hayden who at the time was the head of nsa this is before he went over to cia
said that 9 11 was the opportunity that nsa had been waiting for to just vacuum up everything
and then sort it out later so tom went to the general council and the general council had not
been read into the program and so the general council said i don't know what you're talking
about there's nothing i can do he went to the inspector general the inspector general said
that this was over his pay grade and that he should go to the do d inspector general he went
to the do d inspector general with documents the do do d inspector general leaked the information
back to nsa and said you have a rogue officer here which was illegal he was supposed to be protected
when the do dig never did anything tom went to the hipsy the house permanent select committee on
intelligence fully cleared staff member turned everything over was charged with nine felonies
including seven counts of espionage on the day that he was arrested and his house was raided
his wife was also an nsa uh senior intelligence service officer and the fbi went and said
we've arrested your husband this morning and we're raiding your house right now
you're either with him or you're with us and she chose them so he lost his pension
he lost his five kids he lost his wife he lost his house he lost his career and then
when he went bankrupt they dropped all the charges so did tom follow the proper whistleblower
protocol absolutely what's what's interesting here though is that he also he also didn't get
charged he was he was charged no he was never never convicted only because it was the judge
that threw the the charges out he ended up taking a plea to a misdemeanor count of misuse of a
government computer because to save face doj came back and said look you gotta plead guilty to
something if we're gonna drop nine felonies you gotta plead guilty to something so his lawyer
said think of something that they can charge you with so he admitted that on his lunch break one day
he looked at facebook on a government computer and so they gave him 18 months of unsupervised
release so that we're seeing the technicalities here again right technically he was not
punished criminally for blowing the whistle it was internal machinations that ended up ruining
his life and that's that's generous though the only reason they arrested him and charged him
was because of his whistleblowing but this is this is the problem with yeah yeah well
they had counts that they charged him with that were related to his sharing of documentation
that the but the protections for whistleblowers have to do with protections in court
they don't have to do with protections culturally or or within the bureaucracy or within whatever
else like you don't have protections there right if you violate the culture you violate the culture
and these are organizations with a culture of secrecy and i guess i'm i respect the fact that
you say it was worth it you're you're the one that paid the penalty you're the one that did the time
you're the one that that carries that right for me i was led into a world of secrets i'm gonna
keep those secrets there's i don't see any value in blowing a whistle on secrets because we are
always in compartmentation yeah we don't ever know the whole story but there's a difference
though between blowing the whistle on secrets and and blowing the whistle on a crime there the
definition of crime changes based on the interpretation of the law yeah but the definition
that is the law now is the definition that i used you you made a call based on what you thought was
criminal yes that others did not think was criminal that's right and as a result at after
after time and after the public disclosure of the case the law was changed that's your prerogative
man yeah that's a hundred percent that's why i say it was worth it but but for me i see it
differently man like edward snowden edward snowden's another case where he brought something to light
and then the law changed that that dude has never come back to united states he has offered to
repeatedly repeatedly the problem is he wouldn't get a fair trial right no way not a chance in the
eastern district of virginia right please well that he's he is a criminal man that's what i'm
saying the laws may have changed but he still violated this this the oath the secrecy that he
took but his defense is that it is illegal to classify a crime this is actually in the u.s.
code you cannot classify a program for the purpose of keeping it from the american people
if it is a criminal act that cannot be the purpose of the classification but any but by
nature of what we do there's five other reasons to classify the act yeah but if the act is illegal
at its core it can't be classified see and this is this is what argues for an affirmative defense
didn't you just say everything we do is illegal we espionage is illegal we have a car overseas
right we and that's where we're carrying out the act yeah but what he was saying he was exposing
crimes committed against americans he was he was exposing a program to collect bulk data yeah
but that was being collected against americans it was being collected for the purposes of
identifying terrorist activity in part i think you're being generous i do why does the government
need my metadata why do they need a facility so huge that they have to build a new place in the
in the utah wilderness to hold you know enough data to last 500 years what do they need my data for
they don't need my data in fact not only does the law say they can't collect it the nsa charter
says they can't collect it that it's being collected by the service provider anyways that's okay how
do you say the how do you say one is okay because the law is the law if the service providers protect
collecting it and the justice department needs it then the justice department can get a judge to
issue a warrant to get it that's not not to nsa and cia to collect my data that's only when you
are being looked at as an american citizen for committing a a crime as an american which is
my constitutional protection the fact that your metadata exists and it's not personally attributable
to you but it can be used to reverse engineer terrorist activity and oh by the way some terrorists
are american citizens all the sudden unless you have something you want to hide metadata is fair
game but do you know who the first person was to pose that question in a public venue that well if
i'm not doing anything illegal then who cares it was joseph gerbils and i don't want to go down that
road i believe in individual freedoms i i really do i believe that government works for us that
government should be responsive to us not that we should fear government that well i just hope a bad
guy doesn't get elected or i hope a bad guy doesn't become the head of the fbi or the cia or nsa and
decide to look at me and then put together piece together some kind of false narrative of something
that i did using metadata you know oh he's going to this uh this uh doctor this doctor specializes
in uh internal medicine maybe has hiv so you know let's uh start a you believe that the government
say that again you believe that the government is there to support you is that we said no i believe
the government should be responsive to me it works for me the government shouldn't be able
to target me that's where we're that's where we're fundamentally opposed oh i'm sure because the
government does not work for us that is not i'm saying it should it should not the government
the government is there to ensure the continuation of the american ideal that's the purpose of the
government it is not there to serve you that doesn't even mean anything though the american ideal
the american ideal means everything what what is that if if every american is destroyed if every
american is killed with the exception of the people in government the president whatever you
want to call it one congressperson sure one senator right one one house member one senator and one
and the president or the vice president then the american government continues america is defined
not by its people by its government that's that's what we went to war with the british about
we could have been colonists we could have been communities we could have been people we could
have been collections but the right to sovereign independence is a government thing the government
exists to serve to survive and serve the continuation of the government of the united
states not the american people wow that's part of the ideological hogwash that we were all taught in
elementary school civics that just isn't true they're not there to serve us that's not what the
purpose of government is you swore an oath to protect and serve the constitution of the united
states that is a document defining the government a government of the people by the people for the
but it's still a fucking government not the people the people of the united states through the eyes
of the government fb i c i a n s a the white house the people of the united states are engines of
economic development we are there to create the gdp and the flow of economic power that the government
can then use to enact national security policies or international policies that benefit the government
that's that's the cycle that's the reality of the cycle i understand if that's not what you
that's why i'm a libertarian i mean it what was it that jefferson said that periodically the tree
of liberty what did he say the tree of liberty has to be watered with the blood of martyrs and
patriots mm yeah i'm ready to fight yeah fight for what my independence not fight for your government
no where do you think you get your independence from it's not the government that gives me my
independence 1000 percent is the government that gives you your independence it's the government
that infringes on my independence that's that is your interpretation oh my god yes oh yeah
you know i ever since this i of course my entire worldview has has changed since this whole thing
started in december of 2007 for me and i find myself coming down on the side of some very odd
people we talked about this actually last time amen bundy right amen bundy is a nut
but god and he's got a point do you remember this he's the guy it all started with cattle grazing
yes yes okay next thing you know he's in a shootout with the feds there he is amen bundy
like yeah what was the story with him he was uh it all started out he and his dad and his brother
and brother-in-law i think um they got into a dispute with the government over cattle grazing
rights in some western state and the government's like uh you can't graze your cattle there and
they said fuck you graze our cattle wherever we want public lands and so one thing led to the other
and the cops or the fbi tried to seize their cattle and then they they took over it was like a
they took over a visitor's center at some national park and they were all armed to the teeth
and then there was a shootout with the cops they all got arrested they all went on trial
and then they were all found not guilty i'm like yeah i'm with the bundys and then they went nuts
and said some stupid racist stuff but for a little while i was with the bundys so you there it is
inside the shootout so you you want your independence don't tread on me that's what my
license plate says but you but you also want the law of the land to be like clear and present and
defined because you do know that it is the laws that infringe your independence well no i'm gonna
i'm gonna take your position say it's the interpretation of the laws that has infringed
on my independence okay so super extreme example uh you don't have the right to kill somebody okay
the law says you can't kill somebody somebody comes to your house
knocks on your door steals your dog out of the front yard you shoot them
um your independence would arguably make it so that if they came into your property and they
stole your property you have the right to shoot them but the law doesn't let you do that well
so which one do you support there do you support your independence do you support the law if i were
in florida or texas yeah of course i could shoot them right the don't think that's the castle doctrine
right um but i i wouldn't shoot somebody for i would shoot somebody if my life were in mortal
danger but no if somebody's stealing my dog no but what sakes precedence like it's not about the
example i'm asking is is it the law or is it your independence well i i don't think the two are
mutually exclusive i really don't the government is what defines the law i believe the law is what
defines what you are allowed to do within the confines of your independence yeah no but i believe
that we can have i believe that we can have small government a clearly defined set of laws
and still the individual freedom and liberty to lead our lives independently of government
interference i really believe that except when you violate a law because then there's government
interference but let me let me throw it back at you this way between 2012 and 2022
congress created 500 new crimes not 500 new laws 500 new crimes things that in 2011 were
legal and in 2022 were felonies crazy things i've written about this extensively
for example um there was a man in alabama who um was commercial fisherman and caught a hell of it
that was 11 inches uh you have to be there it is oh hey i wrote that so um good catch by the
way that thank you for thanks steve steve's on the ball he always so um he was like ah it's
11 inches 12 inches all right he kept it just so happened that uh a us fisheries boat was nearby
they pull up hey can we take a look at your catch one of the halibuts was too small he said i'll throw
back in it was still alive he threw it back in they charged him with a felony a felony
and prosecuted him successfully there's a more egregious example there's a woman working for
noa the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in honolulu she's a gs 12 so you
know how expensive honolulu is she's not making much money so she and a friend of hers buy a boat
and on the weekends they take tourists out to go whale watching they're out there one day and this
case kind of became famous because it's a an egregious example they're out there one day and
they encounter an orca eating a seal so everybody runs to the side of the boat they're taking pictures
they're taking videos and somebody whistles at the whale right just to get it to stay near the
service so they can take a video okay a week later fbi she opens her door uh do you have a boat you
take tourists out yeah did you take them out last week yes did you see a whale yes you whistle at the
whale she said no somebody did but i didn't but she said you know what i make dvds of the outings
and i sell the dvds to the to the tourists so they take the dvd a couple of weeks later they go back
to her house they raid the house they take hundreds of dvds they take her computers they
take her cell phone they take everything and then they charge her with a felony count of interfering
with the feeding of a wild animal which falls under the endangered species act felony so she
fights it this thing drags on for five years she lost her boat she lost her business noah fired
because she had been charged with a felony so she lost her federal pension and in the end
they bump it down to a misdemeanor she paid a little fine and that was it but she had lost
everything in her life so government is too much you know we yes we need that structure
to keep us free and keep us democratic and what have you but 500 new crimes 50 new crimes a year
it's too much it's onerous i don't i don't think we're talking about the same thing man like
i am losing track of what you actually think is important because
you started this conversation saying that the that the legal definition of terrorism
or torture from the 1940s was what we should have adhered to yeah it's on now what you're saying
now what you're saying is there's too many laws yeah that law was perfectly good enough
why do we need to keep who's who's the one that's gonna design who's the one that decides
one of the courts the courts and the courts decided and the courts and the courts also
are what approved operations for the for cia but the courts never weighed in on on torture
stuff they said they never did right there are always attorneys there are always cleared courts
there are always cleared individuals always so why didn't the bush administration go to the courts
and ask for an opinion i have no idea i i i don't know which i don't know the process by which
permission is granted oh i can tell you step by step i can tell you step by step
that idea went from ctc to olc the office of legal counsel at the uh justice department
they approved it it went back to cia general counsel from cia general counsel went to the
attorney general from there it went to nsc general counsel and then to the national security advisor
and then to the president took about six months there's multiple legal representative representatives
in there and no courts and they were under the executive branch yeah i know but if you're if
you're making a determination that a lot that's been on the book since 1946 is not really what it
purports to be and the stuff that was outlawed all these years and really is an outlawed we're
going to do it a different way the out though you need a real legal opinion an outside legal
opinion so now we're getting into different things right now but what you're talking about
is having all these these neocons in the room all agreeing with one another and convincing each
other that yeah this isn't going to be a problem what this is legal but what i'm saying is just i
i don't i don't know whether you're making an argument where you want laws to be set forever
or whether you want or may you making an argument where you want laws to be removed or
whether you're making an argument where you want laws to be optional because you're also talking
about being libertarian and want and putting your independence above government so i i don't
know what position you're making man i don't know where you're standing i believe in the rule of law
i believe that when it when it takes away your independence or only when it benefits your
If it takes away your independence, then change the law.
That's a part of the rule of law.
Then how do you believe in the rule of law if the law can be changed?
That's the system that we have.
That's the system that we have, but you're saying the system we have is not functioning.
But if we, I mean, if we have a system, if we have a system where laws are permanent,
then we're going to have what you said at the beginning of this conversation, we're
going to have children working in the mines and women not being allowed to vote and all
that stuff.
No, no.
The Constitution is a living, breathing thing.
If there's something that's not working, then you change it, right?
But passing laws for the sake of passing laws and criminalizing a society that ought not
be criminalized is a mistake.
Correct.
I agree with that.
That has to do with the version of government we have right now.
Sure.
I agree with that.
And I'm not saying I want big government and I'm not saying that government is right.
I'm not saying any of those things.
All I'm saying is that the reality is the government is there to protect itself.
Sure.
The government is there to protect us.
I agree.
That is a reality.
So that's all I'm trying to get at because I'm just trying to keep track of the conversation
because I am getting lost in the different, the different kind of pillars of ideology
that you put out there.
I'll tell you what, from my angle, I'm riveted, so this is great.
And this is delicious.
By the way, I never heard of this.
Good.
White rabbit.
It's great.
I love it.
Oh, there you go.
There's a good sponsorship right there.
I understand, John, why, why are you working with Russian state media?
Oh, because I've got five kids and nobody's beaten a path to my door to give me work.
You know, this is all part of the overall plan.
It's again, my lawyer said, this isn't about John Kiriakou.
This is bigger.
So for people who don't understand Andy's question, John has been hosting a radio show
for a number of years for our seven years now, seven years for a Sputnik radio, Sputnik
radio.
Yeah, Sputnik radio.
The government, I think, or the agency, maybe, would have been perfectly happy if I starved
to death from lack of work or ended up at McDonald's.
And I worked hard to rebuild my life.
The only people who offered me a job were the Russians.
And when they first offered me this job, I turned it down.
And then six months later, they came back and said, we'd really like to offer you this
radio show.
And I said, you know, the only way that I would do this is if I were free to say anything
I wanted and to talk about any issue I wanted.
And they said, done.
And I said, yeah, but I would want to be able to criticize even Vladimir Putin.
Done.
And I said, would you put that in writing in the contract?
And they said, yes.
And they did.
And I'll give you an example.
On the day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I opened the show by saying that I unequivocally
condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and I called for Russian forces to depart
Ukraine immediately.
I criticize.
I'll give you another example.
Do you remember in York, England, I'm going to say four years ago, five years ago, a Russian
dissident and his daughter were poisoned with Novichok.
We were doing a story on it.
And my co-host said, well, you know, it could have been the Ukrainians in a false flag operation.
It could have been the Russian mafia.
I said it was a KGB or whatever they're calling themselves.
Now they've been poisoning people since the 50s.
This is what the Russians do.
They poison people.
Of course, it was the Russian government.
So they let me say anything I want.
I've never, ever received any pushback and I make a handsome living.
Like I've always said, if CNN's got an offer or MSNBC or even Fox, I'm on Fox at least
every other week.
I'm all ears.
But you know, five kids, three of whom still need to get through college, I make no apologies.
So then when you became a sworn officer of the United States, what was your intention?
Was your intention to make the United States to like protect and expand the superiority
of the United States?
Or was it something else?
Did you think you were making a better planet?
Because you have to know that by affiliating your name with Russian state media, you might
get to say anything you want, but that doesn't mean that's what goes to air.
When it gets translated into Russian, it can be whatever they want it to be.
It's a live show.
It's in English.
It's an internet show, right?
It's terrestrial.
It's also broadcast.
But they're going to have the rights to make out of it whatever they want to make out of
it.
And your name and your affiliation is, that is exactly the foundation for how Russian covert
influence operations happen.
Ah, poor CIA.
There's a former CIA guy working for the Russians.
He may do some damage to the American government.
Fuck the American government.
What have they done for me?
What have they done for my children?
Do you really want to violate my rights?
Do you really not know the answer to that?
Come on, man.
It was the CIA that put me in prison.
What in the world do I owe the CIA?
It was your decisions that put you in prison.
It was the CIA's law breaking that put me in prison.
It was your choice to highlight the CIA's law breaking to media that puts you in prison.
There we go.
So we're in agreement then.
Your children's, they live every day under the protection of the United States.
They have all the benefits of American citizens.
You get to enjoy, you're here on an American podcast, you flew on an American airline, you're
staying in an American protected hotel, the police officers driving around the streets
right now, all of these people are contributing to the freedoms that you have.
All of them.
And you're sitting here saying, you're a true believer.
I'm a true believer in the fact that we have to serve the American dream.
We have to serve the American purpose.
That's what we're here to do.
And that's exactly what I'm doing by opposing the American government.
You don't oppose the American government by making yourself a voice for Russian state
media.
Why not?
Because you're not talking about the American government, first of all, what you're talking
about is Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
No, I talk about the American government every single day.
So whoever you're speaking to.
You are giving credibility and authority and you're loaning all of your hard work to
Russian media for paycheck.
I don't see how that's a problem.
Because if you didn't come from CIA, they wouldn't care about you.
So you're borrowing the authority of CIA, that's what makes you valuable to Russian
media.
I'm able to expose crimes that I witnessed in the CIA, sure, and maybe that gives me
a little bit more cash.
John Kiryakus, separate of CIA, would not be of interest to Russian media.
So what makes John Kiryakus-
No, that's not true.
That's not true.
I have a dozen colleagues who have been sort of leaders in their field, have nothing to
do with the CIA that also host shows because they bring something to the table.
They're leaders in their field.
Yeah.
Okay.
I was one of the government's leading experts on the Middle East.
Without the government, you wouldn't be of interest.
If I had been at the State Department or if I had been in academia, I'd still be an expert
on the Middle East.
Everything that you're pulling everything from government, man.
So what?
So I don't see how you think I owe the government something yet.
I'm not saying you owe the government anything.
I'm just saying that the ideals that you had, you must have had in 2000, 1984, in 1989.
1989.
Yeah.
You must have compromised on those ideals.
You must have at some point-
No, I'm a patriot.
Isn't questioning the government and holding the government accountable something that
the United States was founded on?
I don't know the answer to that.
Of course it is.
How?
Isn't that in the Constitution?
I don't know the answer to that either.
Is there, can somebody flag where there's any mention of individual accountability to the
government?
Well, we are a representative democracy.
It is our representatives who are supposed to do that, not us.
What we're supposed to do is be really fucking good at what we do and vote in meaningful representatives
to represent the constituents in all forms of government.
It is not our job to meddle in government.
It is also not the government's job to meddle in our economic contributions to the government
unless we violate a crime or violate a law and somehow otherwise, we're not supposed
to, that's why we have representation in the Senate and in the House.
Okay.
So yeah, my point with all of this is just there is a, there's a very real responsibility
in my opinion.
There's a very real responsibility that if you are going to become a representative of
the federal government, if you're going to become a sworn officer of the federal government,
whether you're in military uniform, whether you're in plain clothes, FBI, whether you're
secret service, whatever else, we have an obligation forevermore.
We will never be normal citizens.
I think that's nonsense.
You can think whatever you want to think.
I really do.
I really do.
If you are a private citizen, your loyalty is to yourself within the confines of the
law, of course, in the Constitution, but I don't owe the government anything.
I'm not saying you owe the government anything.
I'm saying that we have a responsibility, we have an obligation to recognize that we
can become tools for our adversaries against the very things that we believe in, specifically
because of our affiliation with government organizations.
That's just the fact of it.
That's what makes us interesting to them.
I have no, but how is it different then for the myriad of intelligence officers?
What's the difference?
The primary difference is that they're not giving our adversaries an advantage by the
connection to their affiliation with a government agency.
What advantage, though, am I giving?
You don't even know how they choose to use your information.
Of course I do.
I see it every single day.
If you really think you know what they're doing with your information, you are either
willfully ignorant or overly confident.
Enlighten me.
They can do anything they want to.
They don't even have to be using it right now.
What are you saying that they're doing, though?
They could be and they're not.
Let's just take best practices for covert influence.
Best practices alone.
Best practices are you take somebody's statement and you put it out of context and then you
translate it into a different language.
You use it to promote something in some third world and some third country.
If you have evidence, man, I would love to see it and I'll put it into it.
Sure.
They could do anything they want.
The U.S. can do anything that it wants, but they don't.
They haven't.
You don't know.
Yeah, I do know.
You don't know just as well as I don't know.
Of course I know.
Of course I know.
Of course you know what Russia is doing with all of your data.
The data that you were so passionately against the FBI collecting, your metadata, you were
so concerned against the metadata collection.
Dude, I sit in front of the microphone every day and I talk about what's in the papers.
That's my job.
It's a two-hour news show.
That's it.
And then I get up and I go home.
You talk about your opinions also.
Yeah, my opinions aren't a secret.
I give the same opinions on Fox and on MSNBC that I give on my own radio show.
It's shocking to me how legalistic your point of view is considering that it was the law
that puts you in prison.
It's just shocking to me that you are so legalistic and you're making ideological arguments
but selectively choosing when to follow ideology and when to defend yourself using legalisms.
Well, that's sort of a personal ideology, right?
We all have these personal ideologies.
I'm just, I guess I'm sad.
I'm sad for...
But then where do you draw the line?
Do you not give an interview to a Turkish outlet or a Cuban outlet or an Argentine outlet?
I mean, pretty much anybody with the five eyes can be an opponent of the US government on
any given issue.
What do you do?
So from my point of view, there's adversaries, current, clear and present adversaries.
And then there are unknowns and then there are clear and present allies.
If you're going to support an adversary, you can justify it however you choose.
I don't support the adversary.
The adversary offered me an outlet that I gladly accepted.
At a bare minimum, your outlet generates revenue for an adversary, barest minimum.
So how can you say that you don't benefit the adversary?
It's a government-sponsored radio.
I mean, there's no advertising, there's no revenue stream, it's like Voice of America.
If there is no actual money changing hands, I would be surprised because there's always
got to be money that changes hands somewhere.
And you're also talking about...
I'm not sure what that means.
There's always money, there's always a funding source, there's always a donor base, there's
always an exchange of value.
Nothing's free.
It's a government-funded radio network.
Funded by which government?
The Russian government.
The Russian government funds a radio channel for which audience?
For the American audience.
For the American people using the voice of a CIA officer.
And you don't see a problem with that.
Absolutely none.
Do we do that in other countries?
Of course we do.
It's called the Voice of America.
And the fucking influence campaigns.
It's called the Voice of America.
And they are there for influence.
They are soft power there to win.
It's the same fucking thing that Tucker Carlson did with Vladimir Putin.
So you think it's...
So how do you...
What?
I think...
Because there is an inlet of influence that's allowed into the United States, sanctioned
that is essentially sponsored by the Russian state media, that is headed by the voice of
a CIA officer inside the United States, which automatically lends credibility to RT, who
is the sponsor of the program.
So now anybody who listens to your program, they may like you, they may like what you
have to say, but what RT is paying for is for a channel of media exposure into the United
States.
Good.
Maybe I can educate somebody.
I'll take it.
I'll take it.
Seven days a week.
I will take it.
This is fascinating, guys.
I want to switch topics a little bit.
I want to talk about Israel.
What is each of your takes on Israel's influence in the United States?
Not only sponsoring presidents, presidential candidates, but things like APAC, the Anti-Defamation
League, and all the influence that they have here.
And currently, how does that tie in with everything going on in the Middle East between
Israel and Gaza?
And a lot of people are fearful that with the threat of Iran and Israel attacking each
other, that it's going to drag us into the middle of it, creating some sort of a World
War III.
What happened on October 7th, of course, was a...
It was a terrorist attack of historic proportions.
The targets were civilians, absolutely horrible, awful thing, snatching hostages and whatnot.
At the same time, would it almost think the reaction was going to be on the one hand?
On the other hand, we now know from Israeli journalists that the Israeli government was
hoping something like this would happen because it would give them what they believe to be
the legal authority to destroy Gaza, not to just destroy Hamas.
I mean, Hamas is nebulous.
They don't carry ID cards, right?
And so they could destroy the whole of Gaza, something that they've wanted to do for a
very long time.
And they're overt about it.
You see advertisements now.
I've seen them in New York, New Jersey, California, at synagogues, where they'll have what they
call real estate seminars afterwards, where you can buy land that's really Palestinian
land in Gaza that the Israeli government is planning now to turn into settlements.
These comments by Jared Kushner, for example, about beachfront property in Gaza making an
incredible opportunity for a beachfront resort, that wasn't an accident.
That was the plan.
I think the Israelis are guilty of genocide, not a term I use lightly.
And while, of course, I think the Israelis have a right to exist, peaceful coexistence
or whatnot, two-state solution, one-state solution, I don't know.
But they've gone much too far.
They've ignored the international community.
They're going through the motions of ceasefire talks.
Netanyahu was in town, what, a week ago.
And while he was in Washington, negotiations were ongoing in Rome between Israel, Hamas,
the United States, Egypt, and Qatar.
And when the talks broke up, the Egyptians complained that the Israeli delegation didn't
have the authority to agree on anything.
They just sat there and stared at each other.
So nothing was accomplished.
When Netanyahu left Washington, John Kirby, the spokesman for the National Security Council
said that Netanyahu didn't even pretend to support a ceasefire.
He didn't even pretend.
There's no hope for a ceasefire, not until everybody's dead or everything is destroyed.
Number one.
Number two, man, we didn't even have enough time to talk about Israelis in the United
States and Israeli involvement.
My very first day at the agency, we had a briefing by the head of security.
And he was talking about counterintelligence, which was a new word for me.
And he said, he was explaining the difference between declared officers and undeclared officers.
So a declared officer is, let's say you're a CIA officer, and you're serving in some
foreign country.
And the station chief takes you to the intelligence service of that country and says, this is
my officer, he's a CIA officer, and he's here to work with your officers, okay?
You're a declared officer.
An undeclared officer is somebody who's serving overseas undercover and is not declared, he's
not supposed to be known to that intelligence service.
So the head of security told us that at the Israeli embassy in Washington, there are two
declared officers, one for Mossad and one for Shin Bet.
So Shin Bet is not really the FBI, but domestic security.
This was in January of 1990.
He said there were 189 undeclared Israeli intelligence officers that the FBI had been
able to identify, spread all over America, trying to steal our defense secrets.
So why don't we wrap those people up and expel them?
Because they're Israeli.
They're not Chinese, they're not Russian, they're not North Koreans or Cubans or whatever.
They're Israeli.
And the Israelis have such a hold on Capitol Hill that it's just not worth the disruption
in relations, political or foreign affairs, to wrap those people up.
You just have to kind of hope for the best.
I think I probably mentioned to you in one of our earlier conversations too, I had two
friends that I worked with, very good friends from the agency.
And when I went overseas on my first tour, they went overseas on their first and they
went to Jerusalem, tandem couple, married couple, both agency officers.
The wife was the one that actually got the job.
So the husband took a two year kind of sabbatical to learn how to speak Arabic.
So they went, as soon as they arrived, the chief took them to Mossad and said, you already
know them, I'm just making it official, they're declared, she's going to be working with your
people and he's going to be studying Arabic at such and such a university.
A couple of months later, they go to a dinner at the ambassador's residence.
And when they got home, all of their living room furniture had been rearranged while they
were gone.
That was just a message like, we can fuck with you when we want.
Is that something that's normal?
For the Israelis, yes, they do this kind of thing all the time.
A couple of months after that, they went to a Christmas party at the ambassador's residence.
And when they came back, people had taken shits in all of their toilets in their house.
Another message, right?
They finished their two year tour, the ambassador has a going away dinner for them.
They go back home, somebody had cut the dog's tail off and wrapped it in gauze as kind of
a going away present.
This is what the Israelis do.
There was another incident too, where the ambassador was being driven back to his residence.
This is years ago in the 90s.
And two of his tires blew out in his car.
So the driver, of course, pulls off to the side and these two very helpful men pull up.
Oh, what happened?
Oh, you want us to help you change the tire?
Oh, no, it's two tires somehow blew out.
Okay, well, if you can call whatever the Israeli version of AAA is, they drive off.
Well, they drove off with the ambassador's briefcase, which had personnel folders and
what not inside.
Who knows?
I don't know what it had inside, classified documents, who knows?
And it turned out those tires had been shot.
That's what the Israelis do.
It's important to understand, and one of the things I don't think many Americans reflect
on is that there's the Jewish faith.
And then there is the Israeli government.
They are not the same thing.
And in the United States, what we're trying to promote and protect is the preservation
and protection of the Jewish faith.
But what unfortunately happens is that a lot of especially Jewish people who are American
citizens get confused even between the idea of the Jewish faith and the nation of Israel,
the state recognized government political state of Israel, right?
They're not the same thing.
So Israel as a country, as a government with its own security infrastructure, with its
own national priorities, economic national security and otherwise makes decisions as
a nation, a nation that doesn't separate church and state, but a nation nevertheless.
We on the other end here are still confused about whether or not rejecting Israeli policy
is the same thing as anti-Semitism.
That's a good point.
That's an important point.
And that's a relatively new phenomenon too.
If you look back at, for example, I just happened to see a YouTube video of Harry Truman's
statement when Israel declared independence.
It was fascinating because he said that both the Arabs and the Jews hate him because he
forced them to work together, neither one of them liked the deal, that they wanted to
fight in the negotiations.
That's how difficult it was.
Our move in the direction of the Israelis was very slow and very incremental.
I remember the Emir of Bahrain saying one time that the last American president to give
us the Arabs, a truly fair shake was George H.W. Bush, and before him, it was Dwight Eisenhower.
Otherwise, he said, you guys always favor the Israelis.
We actually didn't.
But then if you look at administration after administration, going back to 1948, you can
see how drastically American policy has changed.
And I think it's because we struggle with that issue of equating Israel with Judaism
and really never the two shall meet in US policy.
So Netanyahu's execution of wartime policy, which is outside of legal requirements, and
he dissolved his war cabinet.
He's an army of one right now, basically, with his whole-
Did he get rid of that one guy, Ben Gantz, left on his own?
Ben Gantz left on his own, but Itamar Ben-Gavir is still very much there.
That's what I'm talking about, Gavir.
Ben Gavir.
And so is Smotritch.
Julian was telling me about Ben Gavir saying that guy is like-
This guy has-
He has felony convictions for anti-Muslim hate crimes.
That's how bad this is.
He's a convicted hate crime felon.
And he had apparently, he's the guy who had like a portrait of this guy, a terrorist,
who like blew up some sort of mosque.
The cave of the patriarchs.
Yes, exactly.
Has his portrait hanging in his living room.
I think there is a, there's absolutely a stranglehold in the United States about the
topic of Judaism and protecting Judaism and safeguarding Judaism, especially knowing that
Israel is a safe haven for Jews in an ocean of Islam on both sides, right?
Sunni and Shia Islam.
So there's definitely an element of that.
And then there are, there is a strong current of wealthy Jewish money, wealthy Jewish lobbyists,
wealthy Jewish entertainers, wealthy Jewish, everything, just like there's wealthy Christians
and wealthy Muslims and wealthy Buddhists, everything, right?
There's an influence that comes from those benefactors in the United States that we also
confuse with thinking that we have to support Israel to support them.
But there's also a very real strategic benefit from supporting Israel.
We just don't have to support Israel and their policies under Netanyahu in how they execute
blindly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Against Hamas.
And one of the things people.
And we're not talking, it's not fucking, it's not about Hamas.
It's about Iran and it's about Iran's efforts to execute proxy conflict in all directions
around Israel.
That's what it's really about.
And everybody is talking about the fucking red sparrow.
They're all following the red herring that says that it's about, it's about Hamas.
It's not about Hamas.
It's not about Hamas.
And Hamas is an idea that unfortunately with every new Palestinian that you kill, all
you're doing is guaranteeing another generation of people who believe in Hamas.
Absolutely.
Even the Fattah government has now shaken hands with Hamas and been like.
Or not we, but the Israeli government drove them to that.
It's crazy.
Abbas is so easily attacked.
I mean, this is a guy that's 18 years into a four-year term as president, right?
He's a buffoon.
He's corrupt.
He's mentally degraded.
And the Israelis have pushed him into the arms of Hamas.
Isn't that amazing?
It's incredible.
So, on October 6th, the legitimate government for the Palestinians was the Fattah government,
even though the West Bank was controlled by Hamas.
And now here we stand in July of 2024.
And the two.
August.
Excuse me.
August 3rd.
And now where we stand is that both Gaza and the West Bank have met on equal grounds.
So the legitimate government that even Israel was saying was legitimate government is now
legitimizing Hamas, which is labeled a terrorist organization by 13 of the UN states, which
means only 13 members of the UN, which has more than 100 members, only 13 identify Hamas
as terrorists.
That's a good point.
That's a good point.
And you know, another thing too is a lot of Americans either forget or don't know that
Benjamin Netanyahu is the most unpopular major political figure in Israel.
The latest polls just come out last week show his approval rating at 22 percent.
They've called for reelection wildly unpopular.
Even before October 7th, wildly unpopular.
He's got fraud charges on him, criminal charges on him, collection charges on him.
He's been in and out of office a couple of times.
It's peddling.
So it's Gantz only slightly higher.
When's that from?
May.
He has an interest in keeping this work going as long as possible.
Because the longer he stays.
It differs everything else.
I think even Trump said that in an interview.
Oh, did he?
Back when he was still president, there was an interview where he's like, I don't want
to say who it is, but one side does not want to make a deal is what Trump said.
There it is.
And now Trump just gets a million dollars or a hundred million dollars from the Adelsons.
And I think this is something else Julian educated me on.
Even in death Adelson is influencing.
His wife, Maryam.
Elections, yeah.
There was a massage spy who was imprisoned here, who apparently was trying to, Netanyahu
has been trying to get him out ever since Clinton, I believe.
It was Jonathan Pollard.
There you go.
Jonathan Pollard.
I'll tell you what, I was when I was still at the agency, so just to make sure everybody
understands.
Pollard is an American citizen, Navy of Jewish faith, right, who became a spy against the
United States, yes, giving secrets to the Israelis, yes.
In what year was that 85, I think it was.
Does it say they're 84, 1985 or he was apprehended in 85, right.
And then in turn, the Israelis traded the classified American documents, the military
documents that Pollard provided them to the Soviet Union in exchange for Russian Jews.
Can you imagine that?
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah, Pollard was a traitor.
So every single time, literally every single time Netanyahu had come to the country, no
matter who was president, he would say, you got to release Pollard, you got to release
Pollard, got to release Pollard.
And then Bill Clinton went a little wobbly and literally every head of every American
intelligence agency said, if you release Pollard, we'll resign en masse.
Really?
Uh-huh.
So Pollard got 30 years, he ended up doing every single day of the 30 years.
The Israelis gave him citizenship, put him on a plane and now he lives in Jerusalem.
Is it true that Monica Lewinsky was working for the Israelis and she was some sort of
a...
Well, I never heard that.
No, I can't imagine.
Maybe that was some conspiracy I saw, but I can only imagine the conspiracy you might
see a ton of conspiracies, especially on Twitter.
But I heard something that Monica Lewinsky was used basically to get blackmail on Clinton
and he wasn't willing to release or he couldn't release Pollard.
So that's why they released all the info on the whole Lewinsky scandal.
Too many moving parts.
And why did Trump, why is Trump the one that released Pollard and Pollard had to be released?
He completed his sentence.
He completed his sentence.
Oh, he completed his sentence.
Yeah.
And I think I heard that he flew back to Israel on Adelson's jet.
Oh, was it Adelson's jet?
That's what I heard.
That makes sense.
That makes sense.
It's, it's, there is no, like, I don't know how to overstate this.
Israel is not a trusted close friend of the United States.
In any way.
Not in any way.
Listen, Israel, when I was at the agency and granted my information is 20 years old now,
but when I was at the agency, Israel was classified as critical threat for counterintelligence.
So it was Israel, Russia, North Korea and Cuba.
That's how serious.
Not China.
And China.
Yes.
That's how serious the spy threat is against us from Israel.
The problem is they are also militarily, economically, industrially, very practical to have as allies.
And then on top of that, you have our commitment to the Jewish faith and the protection and
preservation of the Jewish faith.
Do you think it's a problem that both presidential candidates are getting millions and millions
of dollars from the Israelis in support of their campaign, their presidential campaigns,
like Trump getting a hundred million and I don't know how much Kamala has gotten, at
least five million, right?
Not from the Israelis though, from American Jews.
This is where you have to differentiate between the country.
The adults.
Yes.
So it was Mary and the people.
Right.
Yeah.
And do you think it's a problem?
I mean, the whole campaign finance thing is a problem.
How there's just unlimited amount of money.
The money isn't needed to demonstrate the policy or the effectiveness of your policy.
What the money is needed for is to put commercials out and to put influence out and to put marketing
out.
The real magic behind Donald Trump is not that Donald Trump is some skilled statesman
or diplomat or world leader, it's that he understands how to market.
He knows how to get a message in front of people that want to hear a message, that want
to get activated by a message.
The Democrats seriously underestimated him in 16, seriously underestimated him.
I mean, it's just a recognition of the practical truth, right?
It's not that Donald Trump is going to be some powerhouse president for the next four
years.
It's not that he's trying to boost any kind of specific policies for the United States.
He is a guy that likes to win.
He's a guy that thrives on a challenge.
There's a lot of benefits that are going to come his way if he becomes president, not
to mention the fact that he can set motion for things that continue to pay dividends
even after he leaves office.
It's not some passion for the preservation of the American government.
Another thing about him too is he doesn't really believe in anything.
He doesn't have any core beliefs, which on the one hand might be a good thing because
you can adapt to changing situations and changing policy, but then on the other hand, I don't
know what this guy stands for other than for himself.
And there's an element there where I think part of his popularity is that that's what
we all want to think about ourselves too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.
I mean, you've said it earlier in this podcast.
Yeah, I have.
Yes.
Yes, I have.
So there's a very strong attractive character there.
And when you talk about an attractive character, you are 1000% right in the center of marketing.
So what do you guys think, I mean, I know you, you know, through your crystal ball would
happen is going to happen in the near or medium future between Israel and Iran and how is the
United States involved?
Like what does it look like if Hezbollah goes into all out war with Israel?
It's ugly.
Yeah.
Hezbollah is an actual force of significance.
It's well equipped.
Yeah.
Israel would be in a hard place.
I think to answer your question, I see Iran continuing to play this smartly where they
don't get themselves directly involved and they don't need to be directly involved.
They've shown great restraint so far.
And or at least we, we interpret it as restraint because they're using like patience as a strategic
tool in crafting whatever their next step is.
But if you put yourself in the shoes of Iran, they've got a strong proxy force to the north
of Israel.
They have a available proxy force to the south of Israel and the Houthis.
And then they have a proxy force that's right inside of Israel and Gaza and possibly also
now in the West Bank with the growing prominence of Hamas.
So they've got, Israel could have a war on three fronts.
Which they've never had to deal with before.
Correct.
And U.S. doctrine in the Army War College, the Air Force War College, the Latoro War
College for the Navy and all of them, a war on two fronts is something to avoid because
a war on two fronts significantly degrades your capability of winning the war.
We learned that in World War I and World War II.
So Israel's at a place where Netanyahu's policies have driven them to a point where all of their
preexisting enemies now have all the reason in the world to continue going to ramp up
and escalate further.
And who are the two guys who just got killed?
One was a leader of Hezbollah who led the aerial raids that killed the 12 youth.
And then the other was a political leader for Hamas who was actually in Tehran.
So Israel launched an attack into sovereign Iran into the capital city.
And that's, listen to how crazy this is.
We're talking about Ismail Hunia, who was the head of Hamas' political bureau, resident
in Doha.
He was the lead ceasefire negotiator.
So this is the guy that's participating in all these meetings.
The crazy thing here is, he went to Tehran to attend President Pazeshkiyan, I always
get his name wrong, President Masoud Pazeshkiyan's inauguration, right?
And that's an opposition president.
That's a president.
That's an opposition president, a reformist president who said, hey, you know what, we
should have talks with the United States.
Like this is, Iran took a very weird right turn.
I didn't predict it.
I didn't see it happening.
No.
He really would win that race and he got killed, you know, Pazeshkiyan walloped him anyway.
The first reports on Hunia's killing were that the Israelis had launched a missile
at the guest house that he stayed in.
And I even said on the show, that would require violating Jordanian airspace and Iraqi airspace
or Jordanian airspace and Saudi airspace, twice, right?
Getting in and getting out, yeah.
That didn't make any sense to me.
And then they said, the day before yesterday, actually no, they put a bomb in the house
in April because they knew that he stayed in the same house, serious security problem,
stayed in the same house every time he'd go to Iran and they just waited for him to
go and then they blew it up remotely.
But this goes to the Israeli ability to violate Iranian sovereignty in any way they want.
They kill Iranian scientists, they'll do car bombs, they do close-in hits.
They have a whole network in Iran that we can only fantasize about and it's taken years
and years to build.
I want to say one other thing too, back in what was March or April, the Israelis bombed
the Iranian consulate in Damascus and killed two Iranian generals.
They launched 600 drones, but they told the United States in advance, we're going to send
these 600 drones and then they called in the Jordanian ambassador and said, we're going
to fly these 600 drones over your airspace.
So it took six hours for those drones to cross over, so everybody is like sitting like this
waiting for the drones to come.
So the British scattered their jets from bases in Jordan, we scattered our jets, the Israelis
scattered their jets and shot down all but seven.
So seven hit the ground and there's a little bit of minor damage here and there and everybody
is like, oh, that was the response, no big deal.
It was actually a very big deal because it showed the Iranians that the Iron Dome isn't
so great as the Israelis say that it is.
They were able to get seven drones through.
Now what if those drones had been carrying BW or CW or big bombs?
Chemical weapons, biological weapons, chemical weapons.
It would be unprecedented in history.
So the Israelis think they're so smart and so good that they got away with killing two
generals who just were replaced the next day.
And the world thinks that Israel is so powerful because of their reach.
Look how safe they are.
They reached into Syria and killed these guys.
They reached into Iran and killed that guy.
They bombed Lebanon and killed this guy.
It's not as great as they think it is.
Meanwhile, Iran is finding a way to learn more about its enemy without actually killing
Iranians.
Because it's a bunch of extremist proxy people who are actually taking the fall.
What do you think of these rumors this week that it was the MEK that did it on, sorry,
the Mujahideen-e-Khalk, which is a cult actually, but it was originally a communist opposition
group during the Shah's time that assassinated an American ambassador, kidnapped an American
four-star general.
And then all of a sudden we decided, oh, they're not so bad after all.
And then they hired Rudy Giuliani to represent them in Washington.
And they were feted by the Clinton administration and Miriam Rajavi, the head of it.
Her husband was the founder and he just kind of disappeared one day.
And everybody said, oh, she killed him and buried him in Iraq.
Now she's the head of it.
And now she's in Washington.
She's in Paris.
They have big dinners for her on Capitol Hill.
And the rumor is that it was the MEK since they're already in Iran that actually planted
the bomb.
That's interesting.
I hadn't heard that before.
I heard it just this week.
So there's just, you know, Russia's invasion of Ukraine did a number of things I think
people don't realize.
It highlighted Russia's inadequacy to carry out a land campaign.
You can say that again.
Right?
But it also highlighted that we don't really know the capabilities of any country that's
out there.
So anything you can do to try to make yourself look bigger than you are quote unquote paper
tiger is what most countries are trying to do, right?
So Russia's trying to look strong, Israel's trying to look strong, America does things
to try to look strong, China's doing things to try to look strong too.
But there's also a very real saber rattling that happens where nobody really wants to
get too deep into a conflict.
Hold me back.
Right, right, right.
Hold me back.
Yeah, right.
Yeah.
So like your question, original question was what happens if Hezbollah really does go
all into Israel?
It's a bloodbath.
See, I think it's more likely that Hezbollah is going to do something than the Iranians.
The Iranians, I could see fire in a rocket at an Israeli embassy, let's say, or killing
an Israeli defense attaché somewhere.
Hezbollah I think is ready to fight.
And Hezbollah has been training for it for a long time as part of their charter, their
neighbors.
Right?
Hezbollah stands a real chance.
And what we learned on October 7th, yes, there were a lot of deaths.
Yes, there were a lot of civilian deaths, a solid third of all the people that died
were military deaths, IDF, Defense Force, Border Patrol, et cetera, et cetera.
So when anybody tries to compare 9-11 with October 7th, it's not a strong comparison.
You can't compare it to, you just can't.
Not in terms of the number of lives lost, not in terms of the fact that Hamas was a
known threat and a known enemy of Israel for a long time.
They've been oppressed for a long time, whereas the attack on the United States on 9-11 was
completely out of nowhere.
It was unprecedented and it was unprovoked.
Right?
So there's huge differences between the two, but it's a very convenient comparison in
some media channels to try to make them sound like the same thing.
But one of the things that Israel has to do right now is also look strong.
One of the things Netanyahu has to do right now is look strong.
He has to look strong enough to keep the Warhawks in his own cabinet at bay and also work against
a current of unpopular support from his base or from the Israeli people.
And the United States is stuck in this awkward position where we've been making our policies
about Ukraine.
Those have not been popular.
Ukraine has not been successful in the way that I think our allies in NATO hoped they
would be successful.
If anything, the prolonged conflict in Russia and Ukraine has highlighted the corruption
and transparency issues with Ukraine that have just made it even worse.
So Israel and well, the United States is stuck with these two slow horses that it's painted
itself into a corner under the Biden administration with supporting.
So if it's a Harris administration that comes next, she's still, she's adopting two slow
horses.
I'm going to add one thing if I could.
One of the things I learned early on in my analytic career at the agency was always
watch for troop movements and ship movements, right?
If people at the Pentagon, for example, are really worried about hostilities, they're
going to send carrier battle groups.
And today we announced that we have two carrier battle groups, two in the region.
One has just come out of the Gulf and is now in the Arabian Sea and the others in the Eastern
Mediterranean.
That scares the shit out of me.
We're moving fighter jets also.
It could be a show of force, but it's a very real mobilization.
When Iraq invaded Kuwait, I remember one of the analysts saying that this was going to
be tough for us because the Persian Gulf was too shallow for an aircraft carrier.
We had never sent one in to the Persian Gulf ever, right?
It was just too shallow.
By the time that hostilities began, we had six carriers and they're associated battle
groups in the Gulf at the same time.
And each carrier has 12 ships that accompany it, destroyers and supply ships and all kinds
of different stuff.
So we already have two and the announcement day before yesterday that we're sending fighter
jets.
And interestingly, the Pentagon didn't say how many, didn't say where they're going and
didn't say what class.
So we don't know.
We don't know what's going to happen next.
But we do know that there are significant American interests in the Middle East.
You've got not only our interests with Israel, but you've got our interests with Saudi.
You've got our interests with UAE.
You've got our interests with Jordan.
What do you make of the, I forget who it was, it was some secretary of something on TV like
two or three days ago, came out and was pounding his chest about how there are, I think the
number he said was $10 trillion worth of valuable resources, natural resources and minerals
in Ukraine that we had needed to keep out of Russia's hands so they wouldn't share it
with China.
No idea.
And I've never heard anything, anyone in the government, anyone in the media talking
about any sort of resources in Ukraine until now.
Honestly, I thought they just had wheat.
Well, in Eastern Ukraine or Western Ukraine?
Oh, there it is.
I don't know.
People have been talking about Eastern Ukraine in minerals for a long time.
Senate show horse Lindsey Graham.
So now it just seems to be like there's this new goal for the Ukraine conflict to keep
minerals out of the hands of China and Russia.
Or let's look at Afghanistan.
A new wish.
Yeah.
A new justification.
Afghanistan has 23 trillion dollars worth of rare earth metals that were just discovered
in 2015, 2016.
Yeah.
And where does China fit into all this?
A year ago you were on here and you made the claim that before, I think you said right
before the presidential election for the U.S. that China would invade Taiwan.
I don't think I ever said the word invade.
It's funny how this conversation with Julian, too, because it certainly seems like somewhere
you guys interpreted the word invade.
I said China would move on Taiwan.
Move on Taiwan.
Okay.
In the lead up to the 2024 election.
I believe that started in October of last year, really culminated when the KMT took control
of the legislation in January of this year.
And since then, we've just seen a continued escalation of military movements and military
exercises and increased rhetoric.
Right now, for all intents and purposes, Taiwan is politically locked.
It has a president that's pro-separation and it's got a dominant legislation that's pro-unification
and then it's got all these independent players and it's just, it's a hotbed of Chinese activity.
And I'm still sitting there uncertain of if more is coming because if I'm in Xi Jinping's
shoes right now, watching what's happening in the United States, which is the only benefactor
to Taiwan, if I'm watching what's happening in the United States, we're so fucking confused
right now that we've got a sitting president who basically can't take action.
We have a race between a convicted felon and a district attorney that has never won a vote.
And we haven't even had an official DNC to announce the candidate for the Democratic
National Party to support through the presidency.
Not to mention all the challenges that America has anyways, economically, politically, you
know, whatever else, civilly.
So there's, it's such a good time right now for Xi Jinping.
He must be looking at this knowing that after November 5th, after what, the 100 days before
the president takes office is just this window of time where conditions kind of only get
worse for them to move on, to take an aggressive action of some sort.
They're in the perfect window right now to basically do something and we're going to
be so landlocked.
So head up our ass that we can't even make a decision to take action.
Interesting.
But that doesn't necessarily mean that they're in a position themselves to take any kind
of action because Xi Jinping has this plate full of all sorts of other shit.
Aren't they sending some sort of like crazy new ships out to out to the South China Sea
or whatever the sea, the ocean, the sea is right there growing their naval capability
for a while.
Yeah, they've been modernizing it.
Now it's unproven in battle.
One of the reasons that the United States is always engaging in conflict all over the
world all the time is we're constantly practicing, exercising, training, refining.
We used to love it.
We used to love it when the Israelis and the Syrians would engage in dogfights because
it was always, you know, an F-16 or an F-15 or whatever against a MiG and it was real
world testing that we couldn't do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that, we don't know what's going to happen with China.
And China's in a fat and happy place right now with regards to international influence
and it doesn't even have to take action.
The United States is doing enough dumb fuckery on its own that we're ostracizing ourselves
from the developing world.
And right now China knows that its future is tied to the developing world.
One thing I will say is that the arguments that keep floating around about population
crisis in China, right?
Those are, all of those are way overblown.
Definitely.
Like, first of all, if you look, if you Google search what countries are having a population
crisis right now, it's basically all of them.
Yeah.
Right?
Japan.
Japan's having a crisis.
America's having a crisis.
South Korea's having a crisis.
China's having a crisis.
Anybody that can count heads is basically having a crisis because, oh, by the way, we're modernizing
all over the world and people need to do a whole, they need less babies because they
get more time on their phone, right?
Like it's just, it's that simple.
There's less sex happening in the United States than ever before.
Do you remember being 25 years old?
Sure.
All we want is sex at 25 years old.
But now, now, I mean, I got friends that are 45 and all they want is sex right now.
But now 25 year olds have less sex than ever before because they've got video games to
distract them.
They've got YouTube to distract.
They've got all the porn in the world they could want.
There's actually people who do the math and choose that it's better to masturbate in seven
minutes, then go through the three hour process of having a date, seducing a woman, having
the foreplay, and then having sex.
It's unbelievable to me.
Like if you're not in it for three hours, what the hell are you in it for?
Yeah.
No, yeah, that's a huge problem with technology in general.
So with China, China's hoping for a population to demise.
They're hoping to reduce their population because if they reduce the population, they
increase the per capita revenue and they already know that it's only like 10% of all Chinese
people that generate the math, the vast majority of Chinese GDP, plus they're trying to revolutionize
and modernize their industrial base so that they're selling high tech products, electric
vehicles, telecommunications, chips and memory card.
That's what they want to do.
That's going to bring even more money in to a smaller population, which massively increases
the per capita income, which brings them closer to superpower status.
They can make more money with less people.
Of course, that's what they want.
That's exactly what we did too.
You can't be a superpower with 1.6 billion people.
You can be a superpower with 300 million people.
At the end of the day, it comes down to GDP.
It comes down to GDP.
It comes down to GDP and it comes down to the economic impact of the individuals who
are in your country and the industrial base that you provide to the world.
Right now, in the last 20 years, there's been a massive shift.
It used to be that if you wanted financial sector products, if you wanted telecommunications
products, if you wanted high tech products, you went to the United States.
Well now, Hong Kong and Shanghai belong to China, financial centers.
Electric vehicles produced in China are outpacing electric vehicles anywhere else.
At half the price.
At half the price.
Right?
Beautiful cars.
And you have a government there that is very amenable to working with countries of all
shapes and sizes, completely regardless of the idealistic or the ideology or the political
practices of that country, where the United States will only do business unless they
want to sanction you.
They'll only do business with people who fit a certain ideological mold and who adhere
to American requirements.
One of the things that surprised me when I was in Hong Kong the other day was how few
places would take Visa or MasterCard.
And the way it was explained to me made perfect sense.
They have their own system.
Yep.
They have their own cards so that they can't get sanctioned.
And all of these transactions don't have to go through New York.
They go through Shanghai.
They go through Shanghai.
There's money to be made everywhere.
There's money to be made everywhere.
And we, like America has followed an economic bullying strategy since the end of World War
II that led to our success all through about 2005.
And then we took our eyes off the ball and China is a fantastic mimic.
They're not very innovative.
They don't have a framework of change there.
They still designs and ideas and make them just as...
And optimize them.
Yeah.
And make them 100% better with cheaper quality, whatever else.
That's right.
And that's all they did.
They just mimicked our system, rolled out the Belt and Road Initiative, started doing
exactly what we did.
Only we started it at the end of World War II.
They started it in about 2005.
I want to add something about the JCPOA as it sort of fits into this.
The JCPOA is also called the Iran Nuclear Deal.
So we have very specific sanctions laws in the United States.
And US law calls for sanctions against any country that does business with Iran.
Okay?
If you're trading with Iran, we're going to put sanctions on you.
So the JCPOA opened trade relations with Iran, not just for the United States, but for pretty
much every country.
So we signed it, the Brits, the French, the Japanese, the Germans, everybody, all the
big Western powers signed it.
And then in 2017, I think it was, we unilaterally pulled out of the JCPOA.
Okay.
But what that did is it triggered the sanctions law.
So the Treasury Department said, well, look, we no longer respect the JCPOA.
So all of you other countries, you have to pull out of it too.
And the French, the Brits, the Germans, the Japanese said, no, no, no, no.
We have valuable trade relations now with Iran.
We don't have any problem with Iran.
We're going to keep these trade relations.
Well, then by US law, we have to put sanctions on the British, the French, the Germans and
the Japanese.
Right.
We can't do that.
And so it made us look weak.
We're weak.
So now we yell about Iran, oh, we need to isolate the Iranians.
We need to put sanctions on Iran.
Those days have come and gone.
And that's why Iran plays nice right now.
They look, they appear to play nice on paper using the proxy, the proxy tools that they've
been developing for the last few days.
So we bomb Qatayb Hezbollah in northern Iraq and the Iranians say that's an Iraqi militia.
That's not us.
We didn't do that.
Wow.
Yeah.
So I just want to make do a quick time hack for you because I do have to roll a four.
Yep.
Okay.
Cool.
So I think this is a good place to wrap it up, man.
Thank you guys both for doing this.
This has been a gripping, gripping conversation.
Oh, yes.
I want to do, after we wrap it up, I had our Patreon subscribers ask you guys some personal
questions.
So after we're going to wrap it up and we'll do a little Patreon exclusive people that
are interested in checking it out.
Sure.
But before we wrap it up, John, tell people where they can find you online, read about
your sub stack and all that stuff.
Thanks.
A sub stack is where I put everything.
I write all the interviews I do.
And I got to say, this is what the third time you and I have spoken, the fourth time.
Third or fourth?
Third or fourth.
And fourth, I think.
I want to say thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you to your viewers because hundreds of them have come to my sub stack.
So thank you very much.
Everything that I do, I put there, it's simple.
It's just John Kiriakou.

Hey, I got to tell you.
The FBI came to my house one time.
You know this.
And...
Can we record this for Patreon or no?
Yeah.
Okay, cool.
We're still rolling for Patreon.
Cool.
I got to my house one night.
My youngest son was little.
He was...
I don't know, four or five.
He was sitting on my lap and the doorbell rang and he jumped off and he ran to the door
before I could, you know, get up.
And he opens the door and I hear this sugary, sweet voice say, hi, is your daddy home?
