so cool dude thanks for doing this I'm a big fan of all your work I really like
your video essays you do on the coffee break channel as well as I'm a huge
fan of your exposing internet frauds on the coffeezilla channel as well I'm
happy to be here cool how did you get into doing those video I say I love the
video essays they're like they're like their own little mini documentaries
seem like they take a lot of time and research yeah so I kind of got into them
after college and it was sort of like I would research for a month whatever I
was interested in at the time you know I like to read a lot so I would just find
myself reading this stuff anyways and it gave me an excuse to try to monetize it
and so that's what I was doing for a while I would prepare for a month and
then I would kind of that was a way for me to close the chapters I would make a
video about it basically and so it's a very it's hard to describe to people
because the topics are so miscellaneous coffee zillas at a channel that I can
explain a little bit easier falls into one category or another a little more
easily but if you try to describe what I do on coffee break it's very the topics
are much more me following my own nose so yeah no I love coffee break I'm gonna
still make some videos for it I've just taken a little break as I've dived into
this other end of the pool is anyone ever told you you sound a lot like PewDiePie
like you have the same voice no it's very very similar minus the Swedish accent
but yeah that's my first thing I noticed about you I'm like this dude sounds like
PewDiePie made me instantly like you okay good yeah I was about to say that's a
that's a polarizing you know I didn't know where you were going with that I
thought you might have been going the other direction you know it really turned
me off of your people not the people not like him he's a some people don't I like
him yeah I think he's hilarious it's a nice compliment he's not selling any
courses that's a good thing that's for sure and like the dude gives a ton of way
to charity I actually find so I think he just has some controversial things in his
past but I find that it actually makes creators more it kind of gives them an
arc to their story you know if you've always been just this likable guy it's
hard to become more likable but if you've kind of had some problems in your
past you become a more compelling kind of person I guess yeah you kind of like you
can see with him especially I mean he's grown and learned his entire career from
where he started to where he is now you can kind of like see the the character
development if you will of him absolutely absolutely so I mean I learned a
lot from some of your video essays that I watched especially the one about pop
science where you talk a lot about these like entertainers that educate and how
celebrities can kind of people trust celebrities or people with public
figures like Bill Nye for example people will inherently trust them in what
they're saying even if the facts aren't necessarily true I just thought that
culture that whole kind of idea that you were exploring in that video was super
interesting to me yeah it's like I don't know if you're familiar with the idea of
memes sort of as a yeah and I did like ideas that are spreadable sort of things
like the spreadability of an idea being a trait of the idea a marketable idea
kind of yes like yeah so the big thought there is that the virality of our
education or of our science ideas is not correlated to the truth of the idea so
we have these ideas if there is some correlation because if you learn that an
idea is just wrong you won't spread it around but some of our most viral ideas
they get spread around in a simplified overly simplified form that makes them
almost untrue so a great example of that is the 10,000 hour rule which most
people know from Malcolm Gladwell are you aware that I'm not aware of that rule
oh okay so 10,000 hours was this famous idea that you know all experts they
have about 10,000 hours in the bank so if you want to be an expert you have to
put in roughly 10,000 hours to be an expert at any given thing that was a big
idea in like 2014-2012 maybe even before that but when you go over to the actual
researcher who did the studies he says wait no no no no 10,000 hours is sort of
just this arbitrary number people loved it because it was this really clean
number but it has nothing to do with 10,000 hours it actually has to do with
deliberate practice and not to do with the number of hours you necessarily put
in of course you have to put in a lot of hours to be an expert but that the
nuanced truth of that got muddied up when it just became this headline of you
got to do the hey haven't you heard the 10,000 hour rule Malcolm Gladwell
dude just put in your 10,000 hours yeah it's it reminds me of YouTube videos
people will use compelling headlines in their videos to get more views on all
their content I mean every most youtubers do that yeah like what's the
point obviously you're gonna make great content you don't want to I mean no
matter how much integrity you claim to have in your own content you always
want the most people to see it right exactly you want it to be marketable
to some extent let me tell you something so I haven't talked about this too much
publicly but one of the reasons that I stopped publishing on coffee break one
of them there's a few reasons one of them was I've gotten extremely jaded with
the concept of online education on video sorry I should purpose that online
video education I don't think it's really that good I think it's actually terrible
video as a medium is a bad medium for education like true when I say true
education I mean education that's not that cannot be summarized in five minutes
or 10 minutes or in a little podcast I'm talking about education that is
hierarchical like math for example math is a great example because you can't
show up in a cow class having not taken the prerequisites of algebra two
algebra one that's what I mean by hierarchical right video is not good for that
video the primary form that it takes that it's that it is economically viable at
is entertainment so when you see a lot of these education creators who's one of
the biggest education creators like mark robert he's not making he's fundamentally
an entertainer first the function of his that his videos always have to serve
it's a slave to entertainment first because otherwise no one's going to watch it
and you lose the viewership if you just start really getting into exposition
which is where the real education happens by the way and the real nuance happens
you lose all the viewers and so I was getting frustrated because I was taking
these ideas that were increasingly complex well as I just cared more about the ideas
and getting to talking to experts you you really quickly find that in any field
worth looking into it's going to be complicated and there's going to be
experts who've all spent their whole lives studying this thing and they
there's going to be two of them that totally disagree they both think they're
each other are idiots right and to tell that story meaningfully you have to give
due to both sides you have to explain that maybe we don't know maybe there
isn't a way to summarize this very nicely but that comes at the cost of the viewer
and if you want to make a real viral hitter on youtube and which is the way
to make education viable because you're you have to do sponsorships you have to
do all those things to make your channel work and they're just looking at views
you kind of have to simplify you have to cut things out you have to trim the script
and so I was getting super frustrated with that and one of my friends who is like this
who had been in the education game for a long time on youtube he said oh yeah you know
really you're trying to make your audience feel smart
not be smart you're trying to make them feel smart he goes an educational video is
going to be great if it makes your your audience is the type of people who want
to feel smart and that's when I was like alright dude I've got a I've got to find
some other uh if I'm in the if I'm in the entertainment industry that I'm just
going to entertain but I'm not going to have the pretense of like trying to
teach people something if that's not really what I'm able to do to do
obviously and and of course there's limitations to this it doesn't mean
that no one's learning on video but it means you always have to entertain first
if you want to be successful and that's like a that's a bitter pill to swallow
if you care about the actual topic and the material interesting well how do you feel
about that I'm not sure how I feel about that I feel like
you might disagree it's fine if you disagree tell me no I don't I don't I don't think I
disagree I think that it's look I mean I think number one it's definitely better to have
entertainment that has some sort of education tied to it rather than just you know mind
been watching keeping up with the Kardashians I'd rather watch a video essay or a documentary
they're kind of the same thing a documentary on Netflix or HBO that is fucking has great
cinematography has great storytelling has dope music that goes along with it and makes me more
compelled to watch it makes you know something that I can sit down with my wife and eat popcorn
and watch it and we both enjoy it that's not just like fucking sitting down reading textbooks
so I think there's a huge benefit middle ground you mean sort of a middle ground there
yeah I think there's definitely a middle ground I mean I don't know I think no I think I think
there is two and to be clear in my videos I never have really escaped the trying to educate people
to some to some extent I'm still trying to educate people on marketing shady marketing
bad actors you know all these things but I've accepted the fact that entertainment comes first
and I think that was a hard pill to swallow because coffee break was my art project
it was my like thing that I was really trying to be pure about and when you're purely trying to educate
that is a bitter pill to swallow I agree with you that there's really meaningful work to be
done on the margins of doing a bit of both and I think there are creators out there
that are doing that they're funding themselves with things like patreon they're funding themselves
with other things but you find the more you go towards the education this is the this is the
bitter pill the more you go towards the like actually educational the less economical it gets
so so that's kind of the bitter pill to swallow is that the people who are going to succeed are
not always the people doing the due diligence or they're just the people hyping up the entertainment
and really lowering that actual meaningful podcast kind of found a weird podcasts themselves
kind of found their own weird little crevice in between these two worlds right like it's not
necessarily educational it's just people you know vomiting thoughts back and forth right and
you know discussing different ideas or whatever or you know having someone like you on as a guest
like some people that are watching my youtube channel may not know who you are now they do
and they can you know compare our ideas that we're bouncing back and forth between each other and
decide they agree with something or they don't agree with anything i mean podcast i think it's
what's cool about them is they inspire a little bit more thinking i think the benefit they have is
their uh their primarily audio and people have a greater for whatever reason long form just works
better it just does and whenever you have long form you can expound on ideas you can go farther
go deeper that is one of the great sort of crimes of youtube is that people's attention span on the
platform is so short so actually you brought up netflix i think netflix actually has a different
market on attention because you don't go to netflix your idea of netflix isn't to go there and watch
a five minute clip that's people's ideas on youtube they want to watch a five minute clip and i'm
talking in generalities because obviously there are exceptions to this people make five hour
documentaries on youtube and sometimes they find success but when people come to youtube most people's
attention span is like eight minutes nine minutes maybe ten minutes if you're really pumping them
right right because the entire time even the way youtube is set up is to make you a dd like it's
like your video but then there's other things on the side so even your viewing experience or like
people will be scrolling through comments you're not even getting a true viewing experience when
you put on netflix they're not showing you as you're watching the show other shows you could be
watching whereas like youtube they're constantly hitting you with like hey have you want to watch
this maybe maybe this is boring you want to click off hey you want to interact with the comments hey
you want to do it's like this 80d experience that you're not actually zoning in tuning in
completely and that's another thing that just hurts that educational quality because in education
you need that you need to really tune in so that's one of the benefits of podcasts when you're
listening to a podcast a lot of people listen on their way to work they have nothing else to do
they're they're tracked in with what you're saying and so there's a much larger time frame you have
to talk about ideas tell ideas so yeah no i think podcast is a different game i'm not necessarily
talking about that when i talk about my own cynicism i'm talking specifically about my
experience on this platform and some people may disagree i'd love to i'd love to hear what people
think of that because that's my own pet theory that i've been working on for a while mostly taken
from uh neil postman amusing ourselves to death he's a sociologist from like the 1900s and he really
influenced me he's got these three commandments of television uh that i think are totally true
in the modern age what are those three commandments yeah i'm trying to i'm trying to remember them on
the fly but basically one is knowledge can never be hierarchical you can never ask a viewer to come
in with knowledge the only like tv never does that neither does youtube you never watch a youtube
video and they go hey if you haven't watched the first 10 episodes unless it's serialized
like a drama you're never going to watch an educational video that says hey guys we're
going to have to stop you at the door if you haven't seen this everything's built for beginners
and whenever everything's built for beginners it's never going to go that deep the other side of it
is x avoid x he words it like a commandant he goes thou shout avoid exposition like the plague
which is as soon as you turn into nuance people turn off that's just not the way video works video
is not great at long winding ideas books are great at that podcasts are actually pretty good at it
video is not when you think about video when somebody starts just rambling on hey i'm out i got a
because it's it's stimulus you know i've got to be stimulated i want to watch a car blow up i want to
watch something i want to watch something happen but when you're just talking to me when you're
just expounding one idea forever it gets boring and so you you see people compress ideas in video
because of that and then i'm trying to remember the last one i think it's something to do with you
should you thou shalt avoid confusion or something like that basically all ideas must be simplified
to a single point everything must be kernels takeaways there has to be the one sentence summary
and so he's talking about he was talking about education on tv by the way so he's talking about
that but if you think about you know a lot of these shows they end up any kind of ted talk you have
they're always trying to give you one idea the community that's what communicators do by nature
but especially science communicators they want to hit you with that one little factoid the oh
you know something about mars how far we are from mars or hey this is the rule this is the blah blah
this is the secret and in reality that's not teaching you that much that's giving you a
little party tidbit but should education be more than that and so those are his three roles but
if you want to go read the book i would it's like that sounds interesting i think yeah i think
education should be like that but i i don't think that's i mean i don't know whose responsibility
that is but i think it's a cultural thing and i don't know what i don't know what has created
that i know although i'm sure it's multiple things but for an example going back to youtube
titles youtube headlines um i think the most popular headlines are exactly what you said
they're just like boiled down versions of a one hour conversation into like a few words a few
words that just grab you by the throat and really drag you in because you kind of have to have like
again with the way our culture is and with the way youtube culture you know youtube's algorithm
works you kind of have to have that bait and switch everybody's looking for that bait and switch
unless you're unless you're joe rogan then you just make the title of your video your
personally your guest's name yes okay so actually so he first of all he's a legend for that the ball
is required to just like not even well i think it's partially because it's success never required
him to really adapt to like grabby titles but anyways uh i'll say this about youtube like this
is my biggest hate and why i think education is sort of dying on youtube um the other factor is
okay how do i explain this there is no reputation on youtube which drives me crazy so how did the
new york times have the luxury to kind of build a reputation well it's because reputation matter
everyone kind of knows the new york times maybe less now but as as a reputable newspaper you
have reputation there and reputation allows you to sink cost into quality knowing that it'll pay off
and it'll pay off in the future right so youtube to some extent that was captured in subscribers
you could build a reputation because hey i'm getting you you're subscribing to my content so i know
that if i publish something that's maybe a little off the wall maybe not as grabby maybe not as
clickbaity i know my audience will still be there because you guys have signed up to my newspaper
you you've got my reputation matters to you and so it'll surface in the algorithm well what youtube
has done is they've really distanced themselves from subscribers it's largely a vanity number it
still means something but it's largely a vanity number you'll see channels with millions of subscribers
who get 10 000 views in a video and you're thinking how does that happen well how it happens is youtube
is now deciding for the viewer that they're not interested in a show even if they've already
subscribed to it because they didn't click on the last video and so they won't show you this video
right they're saying hey you're normal you're normal fans they're not clicking on this video as much
so we'll we're going to test it out we'll test it out with 10 of your audience and if they don't
click on the video at like a high click through rate then we're not even going to show it to the
rest of your fans who have all agreed that they want to see your stuff and so what does this do
it incentivizes that it tells the creator that every video has to still be grabby you can never
graduate from people magazine where you're trying to grab people's attention because you're forever
in competition for their attention because if you don't if every video doesn't hit like that
then you're sacrificing your long-term growth where if if the if there was reputation involved
you could build sort of that more qualified reputation of you know you guys know me
and you wouldn't have to do that now as you pointed out rightfully there are still a few
creators who get away with this who still can build that reputation if you're big enough
you don't have to play by everyone else's rules but if you're a normal creator on youtube if you're
not playing the clickbait game if you're not playing the over the top titles you're going to lose
and it's sad that we're doing that like it's sad that the whole platform is having to to bend to
these new incentives and it's like how do we build a platform a video platform where you can grow
that trust with your audience and know that your audience will be there because you've made quality
things in the past they'll trust you enough to show it to your subscribers now i don't know i don't
know the answer to that but that i think part of it yeah it's a sad evolution of youtube and how it's
changed because of the growth i mean i'm sure there's things that we don't know about like you
know what's happened with the way the company's grown and the billions of hours of content that
are uploaded every day i'm sure there's things that they have to do to keep their their shareholders
happy that you know includes this kind of suppression of content that makes people have
to run this rat race of clickbait this clickbait rat race yeah no i mean there's depth there's
definitely a side to it ultimately they're just optimizing for long-term audience retention
but what they're not optimizing for is long-term creator freedom and creator satisfaction so right
they're they're like in they want to make sure they retain you as long as possible on the site
but they don't realize and there's not really a great metric to do it as far as i'm aware to
measure okay how does this affect creators now that we really don't show their videos to everyone
anymore we only show them to the like five percent who clicked it last time and you're left in this
like spinning wheel of having to clickbait how does that change how does that change their content
every piece of the algorithm is like an evolutionary pressure on the ecosystem and your
creators will change what they're making based on an algorithm change we saw this with as they
valued watch time videos got longer now it used to be you'd see a video of a person you know saying
i jump off a giant cliff and it's them jumping off the giant cliff now if you go to youtube 2020
they'll say hey watch me jump off this cliff they'll jump off they'll freeze frame let me show you
how i got here and then it's 10 minutes of stupid pointless exposition and it's like you'd think
about why is this here why is why is this all this filler here why just so many videos just
pointless filler well it's because the evolutionary pressures of the platform they've said we want
more content so creators go well i'll find a way to fit it in there i'll bait you and then i'll put
eight minutes of filler uh and and they didn't actually give you what i baited you with at the
beginning so that's that's what happens is youtube i think they're probably aware but i
think they could become a lot more aware of how are they affecting the creators on the platform
and long term is this going to make youtube a place where you don't feel like you can find
the quality creators anymore because they've stopped creating or they've really kind of sold
out to the clickbaity uh you know over hyped content yeah isn't it weird how something like
that like just a little change in a youtube algorithm can just affect the way that kids think
in general like the like culture of people in a under the age of 30 like a change in a youtube
algorithm can change the way a huge portion of this population thinks and acts in any sense
it's so it's insane to have that much power um yeah because because they're creating the world
in which we can have dialogue and the incentives shape how big your megaphone is and when everyone's
trying to get the biggest megaphone to share their ideas whatever game you're going to tell me to play
a lot of people are willing to play it you know and so yeah it's whatever they're like
incentivizing creators to do they don't even have to say it because creators will just find out
they'll find out the way to play the game and then they'll tell all their friends and everyone
will start to play it and you you just see like the same recycled behavior okay so going back to
the coffee break videos you're making the uh the long form video essays
what did you transition to so what what kind of content are you making now and why do you like
that better oh sure so i was yeah i was making coffee break videos and uh i had started this
second channel called coffee zilla you could tell i have an addiction uh to caffeine related things
and yes you'd be right uh so but the focus of that channel was kind of miscellaneous it's where
i threw up stuff and then i started talking about these scammers that i would say i was just kind
of pissed off about it i was like enough is enough someone's got to call out these people
because it's a bunch of yes men in the marketing space it's a bunch of yes oh where nobody's going
to say anything bad about anyone else and so i was like this is ridiculous this marketing game
has gotten out of hand everyone's promising that they're going to make you rich i know it's all a
lie everyone's saying they're a 22 year old millionaire oh wait no now i'm a multi-millionaire
by the time i'm 22 they all have Lamborghinis that are all rented they all have houses that
are rented it's a big joke so i said enough is enough guys let's call this out so i started to
do it on youtube no one really was doing it at the time and it kind of blew up people said i
resonate with this i was a victim of such and such scam and so i just found it it was a place in the
culture it's a time in the culture where calling this stuff stuff out felt really meaningful felt
like i was doing kind of a public service and so i kind of went that way for a while and i now
i'm doing more beat reporting which is different from what i was doing like that sort of mini
documentaries where you try to summarize a big idea and what i like about beat reporting why
i love doing it is because i'm taking small chunks of a big topic and i'm telling them like
almost every day but but eventually you can cover a lot more ground on a topic so i don't cover
nearly as much information in a coffee zilla video as i cover in a coffee break video but over time
i have really explored this industry which i would have never been able to do in just one video
on coffee break so that's the benefit of beat reporting is you really get to understand an
industry you get to understand what's going on and i really enjoyed it and it just so happens
that it also aligns better with the youtube algorithm of like having some momentum on your
channel not just uploading every month but i also just enjoyed the way it works
yeah it's cool too because things change right because things change facts change
shit people do changes every day in the daily news cycle and if you'd make one long if you spend a
month working on some shit it can change the day you release it and then all of a sudden you have
some outdated shit in your documentary when if you do reporting every day yes yes and if you've
ever tried to summarize a big idea you know the problem which is you're usually pressured to summarize
it in like one or two three ideas but there may be 20 amazing things about that industry you want
to talk about and you just can't and so you just end up cutting a lot of it out when you do more of
a sort of beat reporting job you can take an episode to talk about this then you can take
an episode to talk about that then you take an episode you just have that time to really flesh
out an idea and that's what's happened with gurus we've covered now the like webinars we've covered
the uh the the lying in their advertising we've debated some of these gurus live we've talked
to their victims we've talked to you know we've talked about the different industries they occupy
we've talked about health we talk about wealth we haven't gotten too much into the relationship
gurus but they're kind of their own hilarious little niche but we've really kind of seen this
industry for what it is and what it is is a way for people to make money off the backs of desperate
people so fundamentally my contention is that uh these guys and for those viewers who don't know
what i'm talking about i don't know if you've seen ty lopez he's kind of yeah i know who ty
lopez is he was like he ty lopez was kind of like the innovator of this guru mark industry like
the fake gurus he was like the originator of this weird little he blew it up slimy market
it but it all goes back actually further back to the infomercial days but he brought sort of the
infomercial to youtube and that was like the first really way to do that and what he basically what
he saw was health wealth happiness a course for that saying i'm gonna you know make you your life
you were miserable before but i'll make you happy i'll make you your poor before but i'll make you
rich for i don't know like 70 bucks nowadays people have really innovated on that now they're
selling $2,000 courses for all how to make how to get rich and why i call it predatory is because
the people who end up buying these courses are people who are broke are people who are desperate
because the marketing is so over the top if you watch it and you have a job you'll never believe
like it's so scammy it's so scummy they're like yeah dude i'm just gonna make i was broke but
then i just became rich using this one secret and buy it for 2000 and you're like who would ever buy
this well when you're desperate when you have no job all those promises which sound crazy if your
life is stable suddenly sound just good you don't hear too good to be true you just hear good that's
an opportunity no i mcdonald's you know i could work at mcdonald's for the rest of my life or
i can risk $2,000 and you know go take this guy's course and he says i'm gonna be making six figures
in six months there's a weird thing too i think it it really captures not only desperate people but
i think young people i remember when i was really young i think i was like maybe 17 or 18 i got
sucked into this pyramid scheme um that was called yeah it was called talk fusion
it was like this vmit this email video marketing thing where if you use it you can send videos
inside of emails and it's the most innovative cutting-edge piece of technology especially
for marketing your business and if you sell this marketing thing to this marketing tool to your friends
you can then make you know x earn exponential sales revenue or commission on it right and i was
like i was so excited about it i was because i this is my first introduction to what a pyramid scheme
was or i think it was called an mlm multi-level marketing thing oh yeah and i was like i was
thinking about it all day every day i couldn't even sleep at night because i was thinking about
like all the cool shit i was going to do i'm like i know how to do video better than anybody
i'm like 18 at the time and i was like all these old people doing it i'm going to blow them out of
the water i know i could do cool stuff i know how to use photoshop and i was just i was so sucked
into sucked into it and i thought it was so cool i had never you know owned my own business at that
point i had never got sucked into the get rich like opportunity mentality yes is what all these
guys get sucked into and it's because sort of if you haven't been scammed once it's sort of
you're not inoculated to the disease sort of thing like it's like you haven't gotten chicken
pox or something you're just you just don't your body doesn't know what it is your mind doesn't know
what it is so when you're hearing these guys go through the same pitch that all of them use it's
sort of the same formula repeats over and over and over you don't recognize it and so you kind of
fall to just believing it you just default to like oh yeah why would this guy lie to me of course
it's this amazing opportunity and then you end up buying in and ultimately you realize wait this
isn't nearly as easy as they made it sound they made it sound like everybody could get rich together
and da da da and of course that isn't true and the only people who really get rich are people who
scammed enough people and then they get rich but then everyone else loses money so so yeah it's an
unfortunate system but that's exactly what's going on with these gurus as well as they're saying hey
i'm gonna make you rich on amazon well of course the reality is is jeff bezos does not make anyone
rich for free that's just uh just i mean think about it for two seconds the guy's one of the
most ruthless business owners of all time you think he's going to make you rich overnight
but they make it sound like such an easy thing that people end up paying them two thousand dollars
to get rich quick and now what these guys do is they take the money from the course that they're
selling on how to get rich on amazon they say look how rich i am from amazon and it's like wait
no no no you didn't make the money from amazon you made the money from selling get rich on amazon
which is a totally different thing and they're flashing the car they're flashing the house and
they're making it sound like you can get this if you sell on amazon well maybe if you're one of the
best 30 party sellers of all time but you're going to be in the 0.1 percent of society uh but most
people are going to fail you know i i did the math because amazon fba is really big right now fulfillment
by amazon is what that means they're people who basically they take products from china they
sell them on amazon for a markup uh that's simplifying it a little bit but people say oh it's
such a good opportunity well i ran the numbers according to third party data from amazon themselves
about eight percent of people make that are selling on amazon make a fry cook's income
eight percent on amazon even make what a fry cook makes so these people saying oh yeah it's the best
opportunity ever oh you're going to make so much money hey you could work at mcdonald's and make
more than 92 of them are you joking that's not a great opportunity right like even just saying it
it sounds ridiculous and even a smaller percent make you know 60 000 a year and then it's like
one percent makes a really good income like one percent of all third party sellers but you're
telling young kids that they're just going to jump in they don't even have a work ethic
they're going to jump in amazon but thanks to your magical secrets they're going to make tons of
money no it's not going to happen yeah it's super predatory it's super super predatory i know you
don't predatory these people these people are told to take out credit cards take out a loan
for this course and it's like so now they're less than zero they were at zero now they're at below
zero because you sold them on this crazy idea and it's not just amazon fba it's they create a new
opportunity every month it's like 4x you know day trading oh man the new secret is drop shipping the
new secret is amazon automation the new secret is it's all a bunch of new secrets and but they
all run the same business model which is really they're making money from the course they're not
actually doing the thing and these guys also spend a shitload of money on so i mean correct me if
i'm wrong on ads yeah these guys spend a shitload of money on google ads right so pre-roll commercials
that are on youtube correct and i noticed watching a bunch of your videos that these guys have their
commercials in front of your videos that are calling out fake gurus oh it's hilarious like
there was one guy i got one guy i got his commercial like three times it's the guy i don't know what
his name is but he's sitting there in front of his computer and in his office he's got like a
Lamborghini or a Ferrari behind him with lights shining down on it because that's normal right
you put your Ferrari with your computer yeah yeah right anyways yeah no it's no it's ridiculous it's
my favorite thing about my channel is that if you didn't think it was a big deal before you will
understand that it's everywhere because as soon as you start watching my videos you'll see what i'm
talking about it's like really funny i don't think there's ever been such a perfect like they're
proving my point as when they run ads on my videos it's and it's only because the algorithm's bad and
it doesn't see that i'm bashing these people and so it just sees the keywords and it just
automatically puts me in their like ad category i guess but they spend a bunch of money on my pro
on my show trying to advertise on it just automatically and nobody's converting because
nobody wants to buy it because they're getting seen these people get caught out so it's hilarious
so hopefully i'm driving up their cost per acquisition yeah you definitely are i think you
are for sure so who are some of the biggest fake gurus that you've uncovered i think probably dan
locks the biggest okay dan locks the one that i don't know anything about sure i did i did some i
did some looking into him i you know i know that he has some sort of a pyramid scheme set up with
people that are underneath him that are trying to sell his stuff is that right sort of so a lot
of these guys do affiliate and it's not quite a pyramid scheme but it's close where basically
what they say is hey okay you're gonna you take my course and then you sell my course to your friends
and then you make a commission off that but it doesn't go any level deeper than that because
if your friends sell a course you don't then get money that would make it a pyramid scheme
if it is if it like float all the way up but it's really just a one line it just like you make a
kickback on what you sell to other people just like a sales commission kind of yeah yeah but
it is funny yeah because these guys who are supposed to be trained to become high ticket
closers become high ticket closers for high ticket closer and it's like this big loop of
like you're selling the product and then those people are trained to sell the product and it's
like wait who what are you actually selling besides the product like what are you really doing uh but
Dan Lok know he's this um he's this Asian gentleman from Canada and he's built this huge following
off the idea that he's the boss in the Bentley that's what he calls himself and he's the high
ticket closer he teaches people how to sell high ticket items right um but the thing is
is he takes anybody so he'll take a kid off the street and supposedly he's training them to be a
high ticket closer but I've talked to these guys on the phone they're like yeah I completed the
course I've never sold anything in my life not only have I not sold a high ticket thing I've never
sold anything at all and you're calling me you're just calling me a high ticket closer I've never
sold anything these people are not salesmen and if you've done an ounce of selling what you know
is that sales books cannot really take you that far they're great to read but then you it's like
basketball it's like hey how much are you going to read about technique the way to get good is by
doing the thing right and so the real way to sell is by doing the thing but he's sort of famous for
really spending millions and millions of dollars on ads getting so many people involved and then
the big thing was the upsells so it wasn't just about the $2,000 course it was about hey once
you're done with the $2,000 one really the way to become a high ticket closer I mean mind you nobody
has sold anything yet is to go join the inner circle okay what's the inner circle well that's
more money okay go spend more money on Dan's inner circle all right but once you go to Dan's inner
circle now you got to go to the closures in black event okay you go to closures in black event
you spend a few thousand dollars on that now at closures in black it's a big sales pitch for
high ticket millionaire now what's high ticket millionaire well you still haven't sold a course
but now you can spend even more money and now we're talking about tens of thousands of dollars
on this high ticket millionaire thing and what people told me who were in this thing in the
sales pitch was people were running to the back to swipe their credit cards people were
crying that their credit cards have been declined because it had been racked up with so much spend
on Danlock stuff and this guy goes the famous thing is from one of my you know victim testimonials is
if I could sell my soul to take this course I would I would do anything to take this course
you know can someone give me a loan I'll pay it back and these people are already mountains in debt
they went to Dan in the first place because a lot of them are desperate and it's like this
so that's really where you go from predatory to even something almost worse than that
because you have these people basically ruining what they had left of a life they already were
struggling to find their footing they ruined what left they had of that because now they're in debt
they're not selling and then Dan instills in them this idea that like well maybe the reason you're
not selling is because you don't believe enough in the product maybe you need to take this other
class maybe you need to do this other thing right and it's it's this really vicious cycle people
have gotten you know $50,000 in debt uh or they spent $50,000 it's just crazy it sounds a lot like
Scientology well that's the thing it's very it's very like really cult like and religious
yeah the people from it called it both people I love talked to called it a cult the guy has
him everyone call him sifu he calls it a family the high ticket closer family the htc family
he called has him call each other brothers and sisters he says if your family's not supportive
you know maybe maybe don't talk to your family you know like what what is your family doing they
don't want you to succeed hey we're your real family we're the high ticket closer family we're
your brothers and sisters it's a very cult like you're supposed to listen to these meditations
in his course like every morning and every night of Dan Locke talking to you like of affirmations
and you're supposed to like it's crazy it's absolutely crazy um and so yeah that's one of
the worst things that I've seen so far but now he specifically teaches like how to be good at selling
like the psych the psych I mean because sales is all about most people who do sales are all into
psychology and and uh all kinds of weird things like you know building the ways to build rapport
with people to make them like you and want to want what you have to offer right so is that what
he's teaching yeah but that's not even really what he's good at he's mostly a copywriter I mean this
is again all my opinion I'm just gonna say because Dan Locke sent me a cease and desist letters before
for saying what I'm saying so let me reiterate has he really this is my opinion oh yeah I've got
one right over there actually I packed it up um but yeah I could have gotten it for you if I know
we're gonna talk about this I would have shown it to you yeah they like showed up at my door and
they're like hey this is from Dan Locke you know you da da da and the letter was like you can't
talk about this we're gonna sue you yada yada yada but I don't know they can't intimidate me so
so it's ridiculous I mean I mean it's ridiculous and that's how I know that I'm getting through to
people is because the fact that they're wanting to intimidate me with lawsuit threats why would you do
that to somebody who's not affecting your bottom line if you had such a pristine course no one would
be leaving just because some guy started criticizing you a little bit yeah no that's that's uh something
I noticed when Graham Stephan came down here I was doing this like little documentary series
about a real estate investor and uh you know it was kind of like what you were doing with
coffee break it was more of like an art project where I put a lot of time into creating these cool
like cinematic videos that told a story it was like its own little
like business comedy documentary type thing I was doing and it became the most popular thing
on my channel because it was probably 80% just entertainment and a little bit of education
sprinkled in there and uh I just had this outpouring of people that were emailing me and messaging me
you know all day every day of like these like it was all always the same thing it was always
people who had not made it and they were they were super motivated to make it and like their
their profile pictures was them wearing a suit and tie you know and they're an up and coming
realtor or they're up a coming real estate agent and uh you know they want to please just introduce
me to this guy please what can I do to meet this guy and you know they weren't seeing what I was
seeing you know they have this perspective people there's a huge group of people online that have
a perspective of rich people a false perspective of rich people and I noticed that when Graham
Stefan came down here he was on this show and I and you know he's a he was like a real estate agent
slash investor and I expected him to be this you know hot shot real estate guy who made all
his money in real estate and he also made these videos out of the kind I mean I had this perspective
that he was this big investor who just through the kindness of his heart wanted to share
his knowledge with the rest of the world okay yeah right so I mean that's how he positions himself
right yeah yeah um and when he came here I realized that's not I mean he said it himself
he's like that's not true he's like I make most of my money on YouTube he's like I make all my
money through ads from my YouTube revenue sure so I was like they kind of like sent my mind
through a loop and I was like okay people watch you because they want to learn how to I mean
don't get me wrong he has a lot of videos that will teach you a lot of valuable things about
finance and how do you use credit cards how to build your credit etc and I think there's a line
that you have to dance when you are positioning yourself as an expert in a certain field really
what you're doing is just earning money from the entertainment that you're putting out by
positioning yourself as this wealthy person correct a lot of self-development is just about
making money through the show the glitz the glam um honestly I have so many problems with the current
state of self-help self-development and then mostly this coach or mentor culture we've created and
people don't realize that the reason everyone's talking about you need a mentor you need a mentor
you need a mentor you need a mentor is because they want to be your mentor like how hilarious is
that it's like a piano teacher saying hey you really need a piano teacher it's like all right well
of course you're going to say that you're trying to sell yourself to me but I think it's done this
real disservice for young people trying to make their way in they've never experienced any success
so they don't know how to get it and it's just kind of this like magical thing to them and you have a
bunch of quote quote successful people saying how you become successful as you get a mentor and you
copy them okay let's be totally clear that is not how you get successful Kobe they say like Kobe
Bryant had a mentor right Kobe Bryant had a mentor hey Kobe Bryant the reason he's successful is not
because his coach was so great sure he might have had a good coach the reason he became successful
is because he put in hard work a lot of these kids they don't put in the work they don't just go do
the thing that's that's the secret the secret is that there's no secret it's like losing weight
everyone's trying to sell you a book that tells you it's not your fault you haven't lost weight
before it is your fault you haven't lost weight before you didn't have the discipline to do it
like everyone knows how to lose weight no one loses weight because we don't have the discipline to
do it but rather than say that that doesn't get any sales because how are you going to sell discipline
when it's something that you have to kind of like that's an internal thing so they don't sell
discipline what they sell is it's not your fault you haven't succeeded you just don't have the right
coach you've had the wrong coaches this entire time and what it does is not only do those people
make a lot of money they they cripple their quote people that they're supposed to be helping
who are wondering how do you succeed and they're telling them the only way you succeed is with
coaches no the way you succeed is by getting off this cycle of feeling like you need to someone
to help you someone's going to come and take your hand to success it's not happening that's not what's
going to happen you're going to have to find a way to be successful through grit perseverance and
hard work and yes there's going to be a little education sprinkled in there but the amount of
education versus like just application and like basically putting an elbow grease it's 99% you
know 99% hard work 1% maybe you were inspired by Graham Stephan or any of these Tony Robbins any of
these guys you know these uh self-help guys that's really what it is I maybe I shouldn't label Graham
Stephan a self-help guy but like these inspirational guys or these coaches or whatever I think Tony
Rob do you think Tony Robbins fits into this category I have mixed feelings on Tony Robbins
yeah same here I really like I've read a bunch of his books I really like what he does I don't
think he's one of these people that are spending tons of money on on google ads and facebook ads
trying to sell courses I mean listen he's he is a guru like he is this guru type person I mean he
I think he charges like millions of dollars to like really rich people to coach them on things right
yeah listen listen let me say that there is a place for coaches it's just that the place is not
really at the beginning of your trying something out like that's the funny thing is most people
when they look for the most help is like at the very beginning they go hey I I just had some guys
reached out to me recently how do I start a youtube channel well there's no really magical
solution you start it and you try a bunch of things no one can tell you what your genre is
going to be no one's going to tell you be able to tell you your voice where a coach actually
comes in handy in my opinion is when you get to an elite level is when you want to min max that
optimize that 10 percent when you want to go to the next level and you just need help because
you're putting in all the hours but basically you don't have a way to see from a third party
and see it sort of unbiasedly like what your actual business model is and you just need help going
to the next level I think coaches can be great for that I think there's a real value to coaches
but everyone's a beginner's coach why everyone's taking you from zero to one because that's where
the money is because there's the most beginners there's very few like people who need to go to
that next level as an expert and so that's why all of that stuff is high ticket but the new beginner
thing is you charge high ticket for selling to millions of beginners and it's like wait
it's not worth to a beginner who doesn't know anything about amazon $2,500 to learn how to set
up a store or do basic product research or set up or how to buy from alibaba like these are all
things that are available online for free and if the person's not willing to put in that basic
work to go find that out they're probably not cut out for amazon in the first place
right i've noticed that when you when you're talking about youtube people asking you how do
i start a youtube channel that's that's another thing is people want to be they want to be experts
before they start something like they want something to be perfect like i've had someone come to me
and say hey i want to start a podcast or whatever what can you send me a an equipment list please
please send me my cameras and my microphones that i need like i know i need at least $10,000
to start this thing and i'm like dude no you need you need an iphone that's it really
and you need you need a personality like you're missing the big things which is like you need
work you need time in to know even what you're doing you can have beautiful audio quality you
can have beautiful video quality and no one will watch you because you do not have the skill to be
a podcaster you need to develop that basic like basic foundation of work and i think part of the
problem is is everyone goes through this school system that encourages dependents and like spoon
fed answers and you're just taught oh this is the answer of the test there's one answer and your
teacher's going to tell it to you that's not the way the real world works there is no one answer
for sure and no one's going to feed it to you if there was an easy answer everyone would be successful
you know who has a really uh podcast with really good quality and really good uh camera angles is
that guy brian rose and i noticed you've done a shitload of videos on that guy i'll tell you what
when i first watched your first video about that yesterday i had no idea no clue those people don't
so give me just for uh set up sake give me like a brief background on how you got interested
in this guy sure so brian rose had a video that was taken off youtube so he is for people that
don't know who he is he is the guy who has the youtube channel called london real yeah he does a
bunch of great interviews i i actually like quite a lot of his guests and i don't think he's even a
bad interviewer he has a lot of legit guests coming yeah oh a hundred percent he's built up this real
thing but he had this thing that happened you know at the start of covet i don't know what it was
maybe he's just an opportunist i don't know but he had one video die and he decides okay i'm gonna
do a crowdfunding thing and i want to make a freedom platform right what do you mean you say you
say you had he had a video die sorry uh like youtube took it down because it's basically
saying covet doesn't exist okay you're talking about talking about the david ike interview he did
is a david ike interview david ike conspiracy theorist who believes yeah who believes in reptilians
yeah exactly and so youtube's like we're in the middle of a pandemic we can't allow this on the
site i'm normally very much against the platforming that was one of those edge cases where i was like
this guy's literally saying don't worry about covet go outside you're fine it's like this is not
something to tell people when everyone's trying to pull together in social distance but okay everyone
has their opinions but what brian rose decides to do is he decides to crowdfund so he starts one
goal and it's like a hundred thousand dollars from his audience and he realizes he reaches it in like
less than 24 hours what then he creates a stretch goal and he goes hey i'm gonna crowdfund a little
bit more oh five hundred thousand dollars and he and he basically says look we're not going to crowd
fund any more than this this is it five hundred thousand dollars that's it hey and then we're done
we're gonna only fundraise for a very short time until the live stream we just happen to raise a
little bit more but then we're done so it raises the five hundred thousand the next day a video
comes up hey we need more money guys we need more we need more and he's grifting off of this idea of
freedom people love freedom people love free speech i love free speech but then he says give me money
to protect your free speech so then people pay him even more money he gets a million dollars from
his followers all from his followers and i started to look at the fine print and he'd make all these
claims like this is a free platform you know for the people but when you look at what the conditions
are the freedom platform allows anyone on the platform that brian rose allows on the platform
and lets brian rose at any time delete things off the freedom platform that did not confirm
conform to his community guidelines now tell me that that's not exactly what youtube did to him
so he gets mad because youtube kicks him off for community guidelines right like violation says this
is unfair this is against uh this is against whatever freedom and then creates a freedom platform
where he has community guidelines that says you'll be taken off at my discretion and oh this is a
huge scam let me call this out and as i'm calling it out he starts rolling out even more stretch goals
he goes hey guys we need not now we've raised a million dollars but that's not enough we need
to raise even more we need to raise 250 000 a month for the next 12 months
so i saw yeah that's that's the same thing youtube does i saw a video where he was claiming that he
was banned from like dropbox twitter youtube instagram a whole slur of of social media platforms
and then i went on youtube and i saw there his channel was posting videos every day oh yeah
yeah he was just youtube's banning me banning my free speech and he's saying it on youtube
hilarious and he's saying uh no it's all this uh big free speech grift where he's saying oh i'm so
censored i'm so da da da da but really he's still playing by the rules on youtube while trying to
gin up all this controversy so that he can basically reap the rewards it's super bad faith
and i called him out on it i said look you're lying to people you said you're going to create
your own platform but really the streaming service was not there it was third party he was like hiring
it out but trying to disguise the fact that he was not actually using his own software he was talking
about i'm hiring all these developers all this stuff yeah it's not true like like a lot of the
things he was saying just were lies and he was using it to raise money so i called him out i said look
this guy's lying to you guys um a lot he took a huge hit to his reputation for that because of
course he was lying and he never responded to me he never replied to any of the uh things there and
then you know he's still continuing to do that it's uh it's unfortunate what was a good podcaster
what was the guy you were talking about who was his partner in the beginning who he pissed off
much people joey Diaz was ranting about him about for something he did oh yeah so his partner is this
guy nick and they started the podcast together i can't get into into it because there's some things
that like were just off the record but basically nick was uh would you talk to him zuckerberg i
can't say okay which i guess maybe says too much but uh yeah yeah it basically he got zuckerberg
from his own company by brian and there's just a bunch of shady things with brian and everyone
that i've talked to about it him and a lot of people reached out let me say that like past
and current employees reached out to me they said this guy's psycho you gotta say more about this
guy because he's the biggest narcissist i've ever met in my life the guy has a freaking painting of
himself in one of his rooms like who does that he has a painting of himself a gigantic painting
in his own office like who it's weird dude yeah that's fucking weird that's a red flag
everything you need to know if you walk into a room with somebody who has a painting of
themselves on the wall that doesn't tell you to run the fuck out of that room then you deserve
to be fucking scammed maybe that's true maybe you maybe you do maybe that is like that needs to be
your fucking icebreaker experience into getting scammed so you can actually be enlightened to
this world of fake gurus a lot of people it is i mean a lot of people that is their icebreaker is
brian rose or somebody one of the millions of people just like him who are just grifting a
living from basically poor people who don't know any better who are just looking for that idol of
success you know one thing i've noticed is that people who are successful they they have people
they like model themselves after but it's never one person and it's always very intelligently
it's not like they most people i talked to that you know have some business going they're not
saying oh my gosh you know jeff bezos is the only person i look up to and everything he says is
correct it's like they know they're intelligent about it they like i like this guy for this
i take a little bit from here they're inspired but they're not like worshiping these people
whereas in this self-help space they're building these like people with all the answers oh i've got
all the answers you just have to be exactly like me and you'll experience the exact same level of
success that's not how the business world works you can't go be evil and musk and start tesla today
tesla's already exist you need to go do something else and there are going to be different rules in
that new space that you you design so i don't know um i think it's really unfortunate that the
incentives of this industry have actually created terrible business advice for people
it's supposed to be a world that teaches you business it's like watching fake wrestling
it's like this is not actually you're doing it so much for the attention and the clicks
we're not actually getting real business advice anymore we're getting like a parody of it
yeah it's like a weird little remora like a whole another organism that's kind of just evolved
as like a parasite that just sucks off what's really going on what people see i mean people
like to use there there's there's certain people that you think of like jeff bezos or people like
steve jobs or even people like tony robbins but if you look at most of them by and large like the
billionaires of the world most of them they don't chase money they're not people they're not chasing
those ones and zeros those dollars they're chasing bigger ideas or they're they're working on
building something bigger than themselves like like building building a brand that's big like
one of your video essays about redbull redbull's not trying to just sell more i mean sure there's
people in redbull that are focused on numbers and sales and accounting and whatever but the people
that make redbull what it is are the ones that are focused on telling a story
100% and that's the success of their marketing is that is that focus the difference in focus
is what makes them such a strong brand is that they're not constantly shoving redbull down your
face instead they sponsor some amazing BMX event and it just happens to have redbull on the side
because redbull sponsors it but it gets so many more clicks that way because now you're just watching
advertising as content which is so interesting most people they they skip the ads in redbull
it's a redbull ad but you actually watch it because it's entertainment in of itself
you have to stay in a certain lane as far as like are you creating content and building a brand
and trying to make valuable content and and shit with some sort of integrity or are you trying to
sell shit and when you get too far on the side of i'm just trying to sell shit the content that
you're making is eventually going to suffer same thing with advertising same thing with making
commercials and but however on the other side of things what's to say what's the difference between
letting google run 30 second commercials sell 30 second commercials for some bullshit
fucking you know guys selling a an affiliate marketing scheme in front of your video versus
okay i'm gonna sell my own affiliate marketing scheme at the beginning of my video or at the
end of my video as long as your content isn't about what you're selling i mean i think it's
like the difference of like running a phone scam and using a phone and sometimes you get called
by these scammers it's like you're not you have no participation in the actual scheme
you know like for example you take you take my channel my ads are automated i can't control
if coca-cola or dan lock advertises on my on maybe i just have no control over that uh and to be
honest i am actively chopping off on the tree on the limb that i'm sort of sitting on it's like i
make videos about fe gurus i'm trying to end the end not end it but clean up the industry to the
point where you get laughed at if you make the same claims that these fake gurus are making now
and so i have no problem if there comes to be a day where there's no fake guru ads i'm actively
working towards that i want there to be you know honesty and marketing i want the price of these
courses to come way down and i want them to start stop targeting young people young desperate uh
mostly men to be honest so i think that has everything to do with that is like are you
participating in the weird scheme or do you happen to live in a world where there are scams
i think there's a mountain of difference between the two and i do think you know there's this
lionization of making money people just think if you make money you're automatically ethical or like
not even ethical ethics don't even come to the end of the equation but you're doing good
if you're making money you're successful if you're making money and i think it's just
from our culture of like we're constantly consuming consuming consuming money's kind
of the scorecard it's unfortunate that that's where we've gotten because ethics is left in the
dust it doesn't matter how honest your marketing is what matters to these people is at the end of
the day how many people bought and that's very sad to me because what they don't realize is that
there are people at the end other end of these transactions it's not just a number you're not
just making a bunch of money you're making the money from somewhere you're selling it to some
poor school teacher who's putting their last diamond going into debt because they think you're
going to take them out of their situation and you're getting them more in debt you're selling it to
some Malaysian kid who thinks this is their opportunity to become something and you're
getting them in debt you're selling a Ponzi scheme to some kid in uh it wasn't Norway i'm trying to
give you a real example i think it was the Balkans who has no money now they're in debt to this company
that this this like loan shark agency which might end up breaking their legs like there are people
on the other ends of these transactions and when you lie to them and say it's easy to get rich
there is human cost to that i agree with you and i agree with you to the point where you're
saying success you know there's a problem with how people define success especially in the country
as far as making money but isn't success defi i mean isn't how do you define success is it being
happy well isn't happy couldn't you define happy as having enough money in your bank account to
where you don't have to worry about paying your bills so i think no no no i don't think you could
ever reduce happiness to that i also don't think uh i don't think money is not a part of the equation
but it's not the goal of the thing like it's like it'd be like saying this it's like saying hey
most people want to be happy and money helps you not be money helps you not be sad for money
problems therefore the goal of life is money it's like whoa wait those things don't naturally follow
if you want happiness it doesn't mean you chase money it means that money helps you
avoid some of the things that will make you unhappy but if you just reduce the equation
of money you've lost the plot and so what i'm saying is that by sort of making marketing and
some of these businesses only about money they've lost the plot of really the purpose of creating
something it's not just to make money it's to have an exchange of to use an overloaded word
value where both parties benefit from the transaction that is the way to be successful is
you make a bunch of people happy and you can make some money on the side there's nothing
wrong with making money right but a lot of these exchanges are one-sided exchanges where one person
is losing and the other person is winning that's another thing is that when you create something or
when you create a product for example that actually does provide that value you no longer have to
spend tons of money on marketing because your product sells itself word of mouth people talk
if i see something i really fucking like or if i watch a documentary i really fucking enjoy
i'm going to tell all my friends about it yeah and that way those people don't have to spend
tons of money you know marketing their product or trying to push some false narrative about their
product to a certain group of people absolutely and even if they do spend money on advertising
i don't care that's fine advertising is not inherently bad where it becomes bad is in these
market segments where there is where rationality leaves the equation and you get what i always
call predatory advertising but maybe it's worth breaking down look when you talk about health
it's the easiest way to see it here the health industry you know let's have cancer and let's
say the doctor comes to me says hey it's an operable nothing to do about it but then you come down
you're some slick salesman you can see an opportunity you say hey i can sell you this pill
and it will cure your incurable cancer what is that what is the price of that pill
to me what can you sell that to me for all your work everything you're worth
that's called inelastic demand it means there is no supply demand equation because
basically there is no price at which i will not buy it i will just buy it forever
that is where predatory advertising comes in because that's the reason you can charge
two thousand dollars for information you could find on the internet is because they lie and they
say the reason you're not successful is because i have this magical pill over here how much you
will end up paying me for it it's two thousand dollars and people will say even though they've
never spent ten dollars on a book they'll say hey i'll buy that two thousand dollar course why are
they buying it they buy it because they believe it will make them rich and they'll pay any price
because obviously any price is worth it if you're going to make me rich and right now i'll give you
my whole net worth to be rich right it just makes logical sense so this is where these industries
become really scummy and there needs to be a lot more regulation around the advertising of these
things i wouldn't be ranting and raving like i do if people went in front of the camera and said
hey this is a really i mean you know obviously you could glam it up a little bit more than this
but if you're honest about the fact that most people fail if you're honest about the fact that
even when you do succeed maybe you'll make six figures or something like that and you know this
is really hard work if you aren't known to be a hard worker it probably isn't for you you probably
should go get a nine to five job where you have to be a lot less disciplined a lot less you know
kind of clever and crafty this just this isn't right for you if people said that and they qualified
their prospects they wouldn't sell shit yeah well that's the thing they wouldn't sell it but i'd have
no problem with it because it's like yeah you're actually being honest and they would have to lower
their prices because there's no way you can justify you know along a bet they people want a sure thing
they've never spent two thousand dollars on something that's essentially unsure but that's
actually what the product is and so in these industries where you get this scummy price
gouging i think is what i'm concerned about again mostly health and wealth sometimes it gets into
happiness sort of religious stuff people you know are yeah tell of it what about televangel
televangelism is the same for a lot of this stuff it's very unfortunate it's very disgusting
you know they they prey on people's sort of trust and faith in common decency that oh you're not
scamming me you seem like a good guy that's something i get a lot oh this guy seemed like
such a good guy and it's like no that's part of their image they're using to sell to you
people who who are vulnerable it's a lot easier to market to them and to sell them and to
make them a prisoner of belief if you will i like that title that that Scientology documentary
and going back to Grant Cardone he lives like three hours away from me
he is a huge Scientologist you mentioned in one of your videos that you actually like him
sure what about Grant Cardone do you like well let me qualify that and look let me and let me
go back to what we don't forget we just got done talking about people who try to make videos showing
off their jets and their Lamborghinis and their Rolls Royces no i know where you're going with this
yeah so i made that video a while ago and i get so much crap for it and the problem with online
videos you can't update your beliefs you know too well it's like a time capsule so the time capsule
of where i was listen i just got i had finished a job in which i took his sales training we were
oh really i was in a home sales job and i knew home sales and my father-in-law had like access
to one of his courses like hey check it out so i was watching some of his videos and it's funny
because a lot of the training is old like it's like Grant Cardone back when he had hair that wasn't
you know white it's back when he had like the actual whatever when he was when he was painting it
yeah when he was painting it that's right um and i thought some of it was good and mostly
he was selling to businesses he had a business that was selling sales training to businesses
and that usually is pretty ethically fine for me if you're selling to a business i don't really care
what you sell you know it's like it's fine now he's gone to this new direction since then and
i've kind of watched this unfold this Grant Cardone transformation where he said i want to build a
brand now i'm gonna go be the guy in the jet i'm gonna go be the guy in the now he's doing all the
guru tricks he's playing all from their playbook he launches this now this thing called 10x the 10x
event yeah all it is is a big sales pitch for all these other gurus products so as far as i'm
concerned Grant Cardone is no longer some uh clean guy i don't know if he ever was but i had just taken
some of his sales training and look Grant Cardone's a good salesman i think it's hard to deny but
now he's engaged in some of the marketing side that is more ethically gray for sure so yeah no i
wouldn't i wouldn't give him a ringing endorsement anymore i think that was sort of from the past
yeah what were you saying though it is interesting though he's from Scientology i think that is
something that's a little weird right yeah he's a super high level Scientologist and what Scientologists
do is they donate money to the church and the more money you donate the higher the ladder you can climb
yeah Scientology is a really weird one where money is so inexorably tied like a lot of churches
they raise money but they do it more or less sort of like is not a big thing it's like sort of this
thing that's like on the side like hey we have to support ourselves whatever televangelists they're
like buy my jet but but Scientology from the ground up it's all about money absolutely and
that's one of the strangest things like your money is your access to i don't know if they believe in
god i don't know what they believe in they believe in a galactic overlord named Xenu but i think i
would say that Grant Cardone's one of those people that he really embodies what i mean when i say the
lionization of wealth like too much because what he's always talking about oh you got to get your
money right and oh you just got to make money you got to make money you got to make money why and he
tries to make it ethical by saying well you'll give it to a church well you'll give it to this
well you'll give it to whatever and he's like you'll take care of your family and sure all those
things are true but you but the source of that money matters and like that's what i try to tell
these people who are selling these courses i've had the opportunity to sit down with a lot of them
and i'm like you know it matters that you made your money by scamming people you should care about
that like you should care about the fact that you hurt people on your way to the top uh these people
are like you know looking up to Jordan Belfort one of the biggest scammers of all time and it's
like why right i'm sure he might be a good guy now like you understand that this guy's a criminal
right but in america we just kind of this the money just blinds us we're like oh he must be a good
guy because he's on a movie he's in a movie he's he's the wolf of wall street yeah another thing
those guys do oh sorry go ahead no i was just gonna say Jordan Belfort's now part of a stock
picking scheme by Jeff uh Jeff Bishop and Jason Bond it it it's called the mind of the wolf and
it's hilarious to me because here's a guy who defrauded people on penny stocks and now he's
supposed to teach people how to trade like why are you taking his advice you are you are you not
did you not see the same movie i saw this is not a good idea he's like selling hey you should go
join so-and-so's course he's like endorsing them and stuff it's like dude you are a famous
stock scammer and now you are telling all these young people oh yeah jump in this course this is
trustworthy it's like dude it's crazy does it fucking matter he's too goddamn entertaining
yeah i know he's too entertaining i like him i like him but i see that stuff and i'm like what
are we doing this that's what i mean it's just like self-help has just become so dumb i really
wish most people could just look there's a few good things in self-help there's a few good things
in self-development that really matter it's like when you learn to work out and they you kind of have
to learn some fundamentals of lifting form you know all these things after that it's all effort
it's not about going to more and more you know seminars on how to lift weights it's like no no
you just have to get in the gym and so a lot of self-help and self-development that is that people
keep repitching the same ideas we've known about for hundreds and hundreds of years
and we're all supposed to continue to buy their products it's like hey we learned this stuff a
long time ago there's nothing new there's nothing new well i mean there are some good things to it
i mean as far as uh what's his name ty lopez he kind of didn't he kind of make reading cool
he was always like running around like look at my bookshelf here i always got a book i'm always
reading a book dragged my Lamborghini and reading a book at the same time he kind of did some cool
things as far as like reading was always cool and it always was the thing you had to do ty lopez
just attached it to his brand i mean that's the thing they just keep reinventing old common sense
as now i'm gonna sell it to you it's like jordan peterson saying make your bed everyone's like whoa
make your bed dude best seller best seller jordan peterson's like the most brilliant guy ever
it's like wait a second your mom's been telling you that forever but this guy coats it in a layer
of psychology to make it believable to a modern mind and all of a sudden you're like wow that is
profound it's yeah no you're right and it all goes back to it all goes back to headland you got to
give you got to give them you got to give them you got to coat the the pill and peanut butter
you got to make it swallowable that's right you know you got to help them you got to lead them to
water to an extent as long as as long as your water your pond isn't full of incesticides yes
and as long as at the end they're getting the actual help because my thing is like well how
much did ty lopez really inspire people to read maybe he did maybe he did more than i know
but as far as i'm concerned most of the people listen to ty lopez bought his course they didn't
buy books maybe they did i you know it's it's hard to know sometimes but um that's my thing about
educate like even educational videos sometimes even i i'll watch a video an educational video
and after it i'm wondering wait what did i just learn i don't even remember i was just like so
into the show i didn't really get much out of that and i and especially when you're like
watching a lot of videos a lot of these guys these young guys they'll just be obsessed with
self development so they'll be watching self development videos all day and it's like you're
taking in so much information that half of it's left your head by the time you stop watching youtube
that's not really you're not really getting anything out of that and so i'm really the real
if i had a message my core message is that there are no secrets there are no shortcuts and the
sooner you realize that the sooner you can get off this treadmill of trying to find the right
advice before you start the sooner you can get rid of the excuses that are preventing you from
just realizing hey there's nothing between me and what i want except my own work my own effort
and getting out of my way with all these excuses i need to find some guru to tell me how to do it
in your experience what do you think is the best way to learn and retain knowledge
or retain information do it you have to do something yourself like and man this is part
of the problem with making education entertainment is that the core part of education is repetition
like anytime you learn to do math you just go through problem sets why do you do the same
problem over and over and over it's because that's how it sticks in your brain for more than 10
seconds is by just basically running into the same thing over and over our sort of medieval minds
finally crack the code and we kind of get it right so same way shoot a basketball why can't you just
have to do it over and over in the same situation again and again until you finally it just gets
into our skulls and so that's how ultimately you learn to you uh i mean you could be talking
about a lot of different types of learning here but like we'll talk a little more pragmatically
like about business you know the way to succeed in business is to fail a lot of business
absolutely yeah i agree and so yeah there's just i don't know i think you're right like people want
to be six they want to be extra before they start they want to avoid the pain of failure and it's
like yeah there's just there's doesn't exist there's never been a stand-up who didn't bomb
for years and years there's just no such thing and you see it across all domains in life and so why
do you think you're special yeah an interesting thing for me is that like doing this so doing this
podcast is a super weird thing for me i think this is like my 74th one that i've done and i've always
just been good at making cool videos with music and you know i've been really good at using my camera
and and you know i've worked on like i told you i've worked on movies and and worked on tv pilots
and stuff like that so it's always good at just like filming stuff and being in weird situations
in the underwater shooting cool shit making stuff look cool and sound cool and just give you a really
cool feeling you know when you see a guy flying on a jet or driving in his Rolls Royce with some
fucking Rick Ross beat in the background it hits you it just hits you you know what i mean it's it's
a it's a thing that you do that you can't articulate the thing it does something to you you can't
put into words necessarily um and i got really good at doing that and a lot of the stuff i was
creating was getting you know lots of views hundreds of thousands millions of views and then doing this
is the complete opposite of that there's no music there's no cool camera angles i realized i am
terrible at fucking communicating to people i am the worst conversationalist ever at least i was
at podcast number one now i'm a little bit better i'm a this is like number 74 i'm a little bit
better at having a conversation with somebody i still suck i'm still not an entertaining charismatic
person i i'm getting a little bit better every time i do it yeah but i enjoy doing things i
suck at because it makes me better at that thing like i realize i'm terrible at doing this that is
okay that is the secret to greatness at the end of the day you have to just be willing to suck
at something and one of the things that we like train people to be afraid of in school is failing
there's like this huge cost of failing in school right um you know there's even f for failure and
you repeat your grade your parents hate you because you're repeating your grade it's like this horrible
thing and now we've created where no one fails even if they do fail my mom's a teacher they uh
they're not even allowed to fail their kids they go hey if you want to fail kids you have to fail
like like half the class is failing right she teaches in her city half the class is failing
they go you can fail two kids this semester and really and you're still on people's bad side oh yeah
we laugh about it at dinner at the like the dinner table because she's telling us about these kids
that are just they're they're not getting it because they've been pushed through school for so long
that some of these kids are like at a third grade elite reading level and they're in high school
and how can so they're going to fail no matter what we should have failed them back then now
they're just they just getting pushed through this system like cattle but my point is is that
there's no encounter with failure that is positive and that we encourage and that you know we enter
like we put in as a regular part of life but that is what life is at its essence it's exactly
failure and then success and you've kind of hit upon this thing this you know core principle
of life that most people they go through their life never getting to they've never really felt
it something because they've never really tried because they're afraid to try because they're
afraid of failure um but ultimately that's how you learn and what you said is true like I can
already tell that you've been podcasting for a while you can just sense it in the way you carry
yourself the way we even organize this whole business um that's how you get better and at
episode a thousand when you get there you're going to be a great you're going to be a great
interviewer and it's going to be night and day and there is no shortcut for that even if you try
to teach people what you know there is no way to get it into their heads with it's like being funny
it's like you a comedian cannot tell you how to be louis ck louis ck cannot host a class there's
no way to do it because you learn it through experience lebron james can't teach you how to
shoot a three-pointer or dunk on somebody like he can because it's just through slogging through
hours slogging through the dirt and so it just drives me crazy where we have this generation
of young entrepreneurs they're all on youtube they're all trying to watch how do i become an
entrepreneur and they're getting garbage advice that's self-serving to the people selling them
garbage courses and the message is you're just missing a course i saw an ad just the other day
and it goes you failed in the past and they underlined it in red it is not your fault
it is your fault and that's okay of course it's your fault and the guys like you just haven't
had the right opportunity you wouldn't you wouldn't believe what a popular saying that is in sales
pitches it's not your fault you just haven't had the right right knowledge it's not the knowledge
gap it's the effort gap it always is and if it is an information gap it's an experiential information
gap almost all the time it's like you just haven't been in the situation enough right yeah absolutely
they find that they find their ways to weasel into that into your mind with what you are doubting
about yourself especially if you you're if you're vulnerable um and failing is the journey to somewhere
like the the problem is these young people think that achieving getting that jet achieving that
success is like you've reached the final level and you're there now you're now you can finally be
happy but what they don't realize is the process of trying and failing and trying and failing
that is what success should be that is what success should be because then that is life
life is ups and downs if it's a flat line it's if it's a flat line you're dead right it's peaks
and valleys well and that's that's where you get the most information is in in failure i mean look
it's this old thing but uh people who experience success early often fail late because what happens
is if you experience success early you don't learn what you you're not you're not really
understanding what you could be doing better because you're already successful and so there's
no reason to sort of autopsy what's going on because well i'm succeeding i'm already successful
and so it's actually a curse in some cases to experience success really early in your life
because you never have those moments which teach you the most about your craft which is like the
points of adject failure you thought something was going to work you were sure it was going to work
you put a ton of work in and then it flopped that is what teaches you the most out of anything
that's a really weird thing right that people that are young that get really successful really
early it's kind of it's a sad thing when you see him like as little kids like makoli colkin
for example and home alone and all those things he was doing now you know look he's kind of a
kind of a crazy person now and well why do you have to become a better actor right like what why
would you become a better actor people already love you what is there to improve everyone's
telling you you're great why are they telling you you're great because your your your box office is
great so they just assume you're great when you're not you're just somebody who just happened to hit
the lottery uh you know on that magical spark whatever it is but then you never go through
that process now some people you can save it by becoming obsessed with the craft but few people
make that kind of negotiation and it's got to be way it has to hit you way harder too when that's
when you have an experienced failure and you're so like i know a couple young people that have
made tons of fucking money in this internet world and especially like gaming in particular
sure that are so young that have so much money that have no life experience whatsoever like i've
been sucking at most of the things i've done my whole life and this when you're when you're 16 years
old and you have millions of dollars and that only last five years yeah that's gotta that's gotta be a
fucking devastating when you get older yeah because you never get the chance to see also the fruits of
your labor it's like it's like almost like the fruits of your labor are uncorrelated or your
your your reward is uncorrelated to effort and that's a really bad motivational structure like
the best way to structure wins if you want to incentivize yourself to do more hard work
is that you win after putting in the effort not before and so when people have their biggest
success you know they're wouldn't on their first project like i can't imagine what a disaster
that is i think uh like david foster wallis infinite jess is one of his first books
and he was you know he even talks about you know what a kind of curse that was um
shiella buff went huge with holes and he's one of the people who like later fell in love with
the craft but there's all that period of just kind of freaking out very publicly because you're
trying to negotiate like wait what is my career now i probably got the biggest that i ever got
like that's weird it's a weird thing yeah and they find a lot of them find like weird things later on
too didn't he become like a didn't he like direct a bunch of stuff and try to do he get into like
find other avenues of like experimenting and like finding new ways to reinvent yourself where you
don't have that huge pressure on yourself like uh j jr talking did this no not talking what am i saying
um hogwarts girl the uh uh jk rally jk rally she wrote under a pin name like robert goldbraith
or something like that why did she do that well she wanted to like lower the bar for a bit so she
could fail without having it also just be it is big upset you know what i mean so it's pyramid
she could experiment new riding styles try to reinvent herself like that's another thing that
happens is you get pigeonholed in your success they want you to keep doing what you've been doing
yes yes like keep showing us the same show they want you to dance the same dance you've done
and you're like hey i've moved on can you like it's hard sometimes uh yeah when you when you when
you start becoming so successful at something that you're never failing it becomes sort of lifeless
and there when you lose the struggle right when you lose that that path like getting from point
a to point b when you're already there there's something about it where there's just there's
when you lose that struggle and that you know striving for success
i don't know and people do people do want you to stay keep doing what you're doing because
they're used to it and they want they want more of what they're used to and they don't want things
to change yep yeah no eventually one day i'll move on for i kind of moved on from copy break i don't
know if i'll go back to it probably well but uh i'll move on from like fake guru content one day
and i'm sure people will be very upset about it they'll be like why can't you keep giving us the
same things you've been giving us and it's like i'm saying my piece and then i'm done like i don't
want to this isn't just something that i want to do just forever it's like i want to make my point
and then when i feel like i've sufficiently made it i'll move on to something else you've got to
if you're if you're at all creatively minded if you're not just doing it for the money
like you said it becomes lifeless at a certain point when you just the record is on skit you
know repeat we both do things that that we can see ourselves in our work and we can see ourselves
getting better and building something bigger and a lot of people they don't realize that is like
i got to keep chasing these like i know a lot of people who do this with they're just they have
businesses and of course there's products and marketing that they don't pay as much attention
to that stuff but they pay attention to their p&l statement at the end of the month like okay
all i want to do is it's a competition with a game it's like gambling it's like
yeah i'm there you can get addicted to wanting to make that number bigger every month or every year
yeah and it's uh the problem is is that in a lot of situations you can win short-term
and lose long-term and that's what i see the sacrifice a lot of companies make large companies
and small creators make so for example to take my one real job so to speak was i was as i said new
new home sales graduated with chemical engineering hated that so i was like well let me do youtube
and on the side i got this job and one of the things i hated is we'd have these weekly sales
meetings and everything was about sales that quarter and like even like there was big pushes
like if we're going to miss our numbers that quarter it was the obsession was not make more
sales but let's move a bunch of sales up like let's sort of fudge the numbers to make it seem like
we're doing more sales this quarter we're hustling for this quarter everything's about numbers now
but there's an immediate cost long term because the sales this quarter is a sales not next quarter
so it doesn't matter you're just moving numbers around but they were obsessed with that not obsessed
with how do we make the experience better for our buyers how do we improve the product we're selling
how do we make things better and probably 80% of the energy of the company was all about now
numbers and nothing about long term happiness of the clients or the customers no no focus on that
and so when i look at creators put this to youtube or you know sales or any kind of these info
products when your focus is just moving numbers around pushing pencils taking numbers from tomorrow
and bringing them to date today you're gonna lose long term because you're not putting the effort
into what actually is bringing in the sales which is the customer experience that's the long term
sales generator is nothing to do with quarterly reports or anything like that and so i find the
problem is is that most of the metrics we have access to are quality unrelated that's the problem
people are obsessed with watch time oh man this has the it's all a competition like through rate this
is whatever well i'm what i'm saying is those quantitative numbers are not necessarily linked
to what's going to get you the views no definitely not and if anything they drive down what's going
to give you the most amount of views and to for example to give you what joe rogan has if you
want what he has then you you can't look at you can't worry about the numbers you can't worry
about your headlines because that's just going to stifle the the how good your content is or the
integrity of your content and the problem like going back to what you're saying about companies
is that i think a problem with these companies why they worry about all their monthly sales reports
and and trying to pack as many sales in or to hit a goal for that month is because you know they're
competing with a bunch of other businesses that have extremely high overhead and they want to beat
those businesses to be listed as the top 10 most profitable businesses in their their city or whatever
that month um instead of taking a breath and being like okay how can we create something
that is just better than everything else
you nailed it i mean it's hard to say it better than that uh yeah yeah absolutely and
you're incentivizing people so one thing that i saw is the sales managers were incentivized
to focus on the quarterly reports because that's what they reported to so their bosses were looking
at that and so they looked at that and i'm sure those bosses were also looking at like so in order
to i mean now we're talking about sort of management theory but like i'm a big believer that incentives
drive everything it's part of the reason that i mock people who are in this world is because
i believe the incentives shift when you get mocked and you're like wait i don't want to get mocked
let me not do this right right right and so it's like um but yeah all the folk when all the focus
is on short term from the top it trickles all the way down to your employees and just everything
goes wrong totally agree with you man i guess i have a agreeing on this podcast yeah we have a
lot of agreeing not disagree on not enough disagreeing not enough disagreeing well we're
gonna have to do another one where we can find some things we disagree on for sure um yeah so you
don't sell a course i do not sell a course never have been pressured to sell a course i mean i find
that everyone wants to get everyone to sell a course now you dirty dirty bastard i have i i've
been i've been sick i've been suggested by by people to sell a course really yes i have i have
well a course as well as so when i was doing that sort of business documentary series
gram recommended uh an additional way to monetize our show whatever yeah it doesn't matter
he i mean he was throwing around some numbers that he was seeing from other people in his niche
from doing seminars making tons of money we like look dude you can make stupid money seven hundred
bucks ahead and you could pack this place with a thousand people two thousand people
and is that a great opportunity is that a great capitalistic opportunity to make more money and
yeah of course it is that's a great i mean that's a that's a way to look at things but
i just couldn't i i can't i don't know what it is why it seems so unattractive to me
to do something like that when because it just i feel like it just taints the art because that
whole thing was like like you said it was an art project to me and when i when i try to try to throw
in something that just sells people an opportunity to listen to some guy ramble for an hour
yeah it taints everything for me it makes me just feel i just feel gross i don't know how else to
say it here's why and i think you instinctually feel what is actually true about what you're
what that offering is you're not giving people their money their their money's worth there's
like no way that that's actually worth seven hundred dollars ahead for them to as you say watch a guy
ramble like what what is this so you're obsessed with creating value we might say for you know your
listener and more value than they're ultimately having to pay at the door there is this mentality
of like just take what you can get sort of from people that i think is so toxic right now and
it's because they don't know who their buyers are it's that's what i find is like a lot of
these people have not encountered their course buyers they only pay attention to their successes
they don't pay attention to the losers they sue the losers for complaining and so it's really sad
to me i think a lot of people don't see the cost of what they're doing and that's something i'm trying
to shine a light on but yeah i think you're just feeling something instinctually that is just sort
of obvious which is it's not a good deal for the people that you're building up an audience of
you're selling your audience out yeah and it's like it's one thing to sell them out in a way that
gives them something that like is like pretty obviously negotiably equivalent like selling a mug
right okay you're spending ten dollars you get a mug mug's worth about ten dollars whatever
that's fine but when you're trying to get seven hundred dollars squeeze it out of people really
crank the toothpaste too for all it's worth that's when you get into this weird world where
you and i the people were kind of architecturing something where we know it's not ethical where
we like we know in the back of our mind that it's not a good buy so why are we selling it
if a lot of these people are selling courses they would never buy themselves that's what
blows my mind they would never buy it so why would you sell it especially because i've been a victim
of it i know what it's like really you bought it you bought some well i was i was telling you about
the the pyramids the pyramids i was i was a part of when i was like 17 years old of course of course
yeah you don't want you don't want to do that to somebody you don't want to be the death of innocence
for somebody you know those who what was it what is it those who have you heard you know what i'm
talking about i forget cannot do teach yes those who cannot do teach yeah let me fucking look up
that goddamn quote i gotta find out what it is it's those who cannot do teach if you see someone
trying to teach something you immediately become suspicious of okay why are you charging money
to teach people how to do this instead of doing it yourself right if you knew so much about stock
trading why are you charging someone to teach them like why don't you just go do it and make a bunch
of money yeah well 100 that's the question they can never answer they'll go spin off about you
know well it's because i just care about people so much yeah right you care about somebody
that's why you're charging them two thousand dollars because that's how much you care about them
but then again dude i then again i have to say i would totally spend two thousand bucks to go
sit at a tony robbins seminar i think that would be pretty cool i've always wanted to do that
sure yeah like tony robbins is one of those weird edge cases where it's like he's so much at the
top of his game and it's almost like a different experience because he's not really even selling
you information he's sort of selling you himself it's like it's like experience a unique human who
you will rarely see and it's almost like a performance not even a you know yeah it's not about
information it's really about like you're just going to see tony robbins you could be told that
it's the exact same information but no tony robbins and it's like going to the super bowl
100 it's an event and uh tony robbins he more teaches like he doesn't normally i mean from
what i've seen teach how to get rich he's more teaching be inspired be whatever and that is one
of those things that if that's what you want to like do i don't really care because how can you
measure the failure of a be inspired speech you really can't but you can measure the success or
failure of a get rich quick and that's the whole thing is these people aren't delivering so tony
robbins if he's telling you he's going to make you inspired he probably will make you inspired i don't
know dude i was listening i was listening to a uh sometimes in the morning if i'm like if i'm just
not feeling it i'll put on his fucking uh tony robbins hour of power and i'll just like listen
to him in the background just ramble and it just gets me fired up sometimes like it gets me it just
gets me energized and wanting to get shit done and sometimes you need that sometimes you need it
they it's fine it's fine like the funny thing though is there's so many free things out there
that the idea of buying some of these courses to me is almost funny because it's like you guys know
we have like zig ziggler we have all these famous guys who did this and now a lot of them are dead
a lot of their stuff is just free online go do that before you join somebody's course right like
but instead it's the shiny thing it's the the marketing is what ends up selling it and it's
a marketing that the main message is like you can be a millionaire by the time you're 20
you know in your 20s you can be some big shot retire on a beach somewhere whatever yeah and
it's like they're really selling they're not selling a info product they're selling a dream
i call them dream salesman that's what their actual job is they take your dream and they
sell it back to you and that's what turns the tickets it's not the idea that i've always died
you know i really wanted to work for jeff bezos it's that i always wanted to live on a beach
somewhere and you're telling me i can and it's easier than i thought and if i just follow you
the expert you're going to teach me how to do it those are the people that i call out now this
dan bolzerian doesn't do anything like this does he he just sort of sells his lifestyle and has his
like his speed brand right i don't actually think dan bolzerian's like a fake guru in the
sense that i usually say it he's just a big joke like because he just says he's rich and he's not
really rich he says he made his money i mean sorry he said he he's self-made wealthy he's not
self-made his dad was a corporate raider in the 80s and he's basically took a bunch of money
a corporate raider for it yeah like the there were all these companies that their job was to
take over other companies with the costal takeovers basically using this basically some stock tricks
you're buying up majority shares of the company you're basically taking possession of a company
without them knowing that you're planning to do it and um a bunch of money made doing it paul bolzerian
did it i'm not too familiar with the specifics of why his type of trading was particularly because
a lot of people are doing it but he's one of the people who got arrested for it okay and he owed
the government like hundreds of millions of dollars and the government has now gotten i don't
know like three million out of them meanwhile he shuffled all these accounts around so his
basically his family lives in a mansion but he technically doesn't own it right like oh i don't
own it so i don't have the money i don't know where any of this money is it's all gone but meanwhile
they're all living in the lap of luxury and his sons uh dan and he's got another son basically
have been trying to find ways to launder this money into actual you know so it's not paul bolzerian's
money it's not obviously his so dan's cover story was i won it in poker i'm this genius poker player
that no one's ever heard of by the way like he hadn't appeared on any circle like he appeared one time
and he did like a loser's run in some poker series but it wasn't like dan bolzerian was some big shot
you know uh phil iives or something like that like he wasn't known in the poker world and so
but he's saying he made more money than almost any of these other professional poker players
have made and that's the way he was laundering the money so that's what i sort of talked about
it's like he's not a poker expert and he's got this like goofy lifestyle brand that spins
twice as much money as it's making in weed sales which is sort of the perfect weed business you
know you're selling you're spending twice as much as you're actually yeah i found it i found it weird
that he does so many like podcasts i feel like like why if i was that guy i would not be like
responding to all these interview requests from people like brian rose for example who did a podcast
with them or or all these other like a great way to build your celebrity at a low time cost
yeah i think why did you find it weird i find it totally believable because i i don't know i just
thought that well because i guess i didn't know as much about him as you did but i thought like
here's this super rich dude who surrounded by you know who lives in this massive mansion in la in
hollywood and surrounded by all these half-naked chicks you know if i have all that money why the
fuck do i want to spend my time talking to this nerd for i mean i understand if that's what you're
interested in but isn't that that doesn't seem like his brand it seems a little bit off-brand
to be having doing podcasts with people you know when you're a professional gambler and
you know professional playboy well he's not really a professional gambler and hasn't been
really doing it for a while ever since he's gotten popular conveniently the gambling has left the scene
which is kind of funny because if you weren't a real gambler you of course you wouldn't show
people how good you are bad you were at gambling but uh yeah he's not really a professional gambler
he's a professional playboy guy like he just right hires a bunch of models takes pictures with him
and or he says sorry he did he says he doesn't hire him whatever and uh i mean when you when
you have that big of a following you don't need to hire him right you can just be like oh you'll
you'll be a social media celebrity if you hang out with me for long enough correct and so everything's
about expanding a celebrity and a lot of these podcasts they'll do that i mean they'll expose
you to three million new people who would have never followed you before right and as long as
you can seem semi-coerent people would go oh man this guy's deep he's really he's really a thoughtful
playboy thing yeah right that's funny man one of my favorite things that like dambels are and he goes
he goes yeah i'm not really like a pleasure guy it's like your whole life is hedonism it's the
funniest thing to me for someone to be like yeah man it's like pleasure won't really get you happiness
man i'm just like i'm after that happiness it's like come on dude he says pleasure won't get you
happiness it's something it's like that it's hang on he said something like uh something like that
yeah i think that was actually what he said but it was like this like thing that sounded really good
but i was like dude your whole life is set up to be the opposite of that it's just funny to me um
yeah i don't know man but when i see pictures of people you know on instagram taking pictures
with lamborghini's or ferrari's i instantly just i feel like there's a stigma now
oh yeah you're you're a loser if you're taking a picture still with lamborghini dude
you're just a total fucking kook in my opinion if you're doing that i don't think many people i mean
other than like people that are in the phase clan if you're in the phase clan and you're you know a
hot shot video gamer you live in the phase mansion you drive a lambo but at least those guys aren't
selling fucking slimy courses to kid people that are desperate yeah yeah it's like well yeah the
lambo has been become the status symbol of the douche bag it's just like you went from the
status symbol of the rich to like it's been so overused that it's now nobody who's rich
probably wants a lambo because they know if you know of the stigma you know like oh that's not
what i want you get a car that people maybe who know know and who don't don't it's like it doesn't
matter you know you just find like again it really does come down to it feels like what we
advertise its success on youtube is just a parody of what real success is because when you look at
actually successful people they don't feel the need to show off they don't feel like joe rogan is a
funny example um he's like he that guy's worth hundreds of millions of dollars especially after
this spot if ideal does he dress up in some suit every day and project success no he doesn't need to
right i mean i'm sure he has a nice car do you ever see it now he could buy it like you don't
feel the need to brag when you already got it like that yeah so the people who do brag all the time
you know they don't actually have as much money as they're saying or pretending
yeah you're totally right you don't see pictures of his cars or his houses or or anything like that
and he doesn't even like to talk about it either yeah any successful guy unless their entire brand
like bolzerian i believe he probably does have a lot of money but his entire brand is having a
lot of money so you have he of course is going to do it but most successful people you talk to
they're not douchebags who just drive around in the lambo you'll never know they're worth
as much money as they're worth because honestly it's a hassle it's like when people know you're
worth a lot of money they want things from you it's like you just keep a low key absolutely
well cool dude i think that's two hours i appreciate you doing this this was uh this
was a great conversation i feel like we uh talked about some really interesting things
yeah i really enjoyed it i think you have a cool podcast it very much feels like um
i sort of feel what you're searching after and i i like it i'd like your hunt sort of to learn
podcasting for the art of it yeah i love it man yeah not only that i'd like i think it's like
i think it's an interesting way just to learn shit period i've never i've never been i can
tell that you're someone who's very well read and you you enjoy you know reading and learning
and just from watching your video essays i've never been like that i i just oh you got you
gotta do it i've never been i've never been the person to just sit down and want to read a book
for enjoyment i've that's just not me i mean don't get me wrong i would like you probably i would
like to develop that habit i very much would and i'm trying to but this encourages it for sure so
that's another reason i do this yeah no what i was going to say is like okay you probably don't
like reading for pleasure because you've never read for pleasure like you like you probably read
some awful books like we don't teach people the problem is we it's kind of the same thing we do
with everything when we try to get people interested we're obsessed with them like learning the classics
and we don't actually have them just do what they want to do which is how you actually
stoke an interest yeah for sure it's very unfortunate we're like you have to read grapes
of wrath like john steinbeck it's like nobody wants to read grapes of wrath it's backwards it's
totally backwards from how it should be and so now you're left thinking i don't know i just don't
like reading no you just you're reading probably some dry stuff from dry authors and everyone
just decided it's a great book but it's not a great book for you so yeah man um do you like
listening or reading better so i really have been listening a lot because i just it's hard to
carve out time and the audio you can fit in easier but i there is something about a book
that uh i feel like you retain it a little bit better yeah i like the uh i like how like on
the kindles you can like highlight shit and save it notes and export it later yeah i feel like that's
really helpful i just got into that super helpful but if you're trying listen let me just say this
before we go if you're trying to read for pleasure don't read self-development don't read all these
books where there's a big takeaway at the end don't feel like you have to uh everybody's
after just like oh i've got if i'm not they treat reading as like an exercise and in like
education necessarily and then they wonder why they don't enjoy it first learn to enjoy reading
like going to the gym you mean sorry are you comparing it like they're they're treating reading
as an exercise like similar to going to the gym exactly exactly and it's like if you just learn
to enjoy this thing it wouldn't be such a pain and you wouldn't constantly be kicking yourself that
you're not doing the thing like the a lot of people they stay in shape because they found
some way to enjoy exercise that's the best way to do it you like learn to play tennis or you learn
some sport where you're doing it you don't even know you're getting in shape you're getting in shape
the hard way to do it really the challenging thing is to go to the you know if you don't like the gym
some like it but go into the gym every day that's the hard thing i can't imagine yeah and it's harder
in the beginning definitely than once you get into the group of doing things because
i mean the hardest thing is taking the first step for sure listen do you like uh do you like
fantasy or fiction i do i love fiction at all i love fiction for sure okay let me give you a
suggestion that if you take it we'll send you down a rabbit hole it's this guy brandon sanderson
get way of kings i'm laughing because i've recommended this book to like probably like
20 people at this point and probably
75 percent of them if you get through like the first seven chapters you will be hooked
you're going to be it's going to be gone though like you're done and it's way of kings way of kings
it's what am i getting myself into can you give me a sure it's like 800 pages okay for the first
book jesus christ that's a lot dude and there's three books out right now the fourth book's coming
out november and uh it is you can't describe it it's too epic it's too epic it's like if you've
ever enjoyed lord of the rings if you've ever enjoyed any kind of book like that like it's just
better than that it's just better it's a um better world building i don't know you can't you can't
boil it down it's like how do you boil down 800 pages you can't yeah you will you'll love this book
though if you read it we'll have to uh yeah i will read it call me it's gone i'll read it i'll read
it and we'll do another one of these one day do it on audible it's actually a really good audible
okay it's hard to read that much anyways like that's a lot of reading so just like go on a walk
take a nap take an hour walk just listen to it and uh yeah again by like chapter seven once you get
your hands on what's going on you're gonna lose your mind hell yeah and you will start enjoying
reading that's the point okay i will do that and i will report back to you sir okay thanks for doing
this dude i really i really i really enjoyed it and uh uh i'll link your channels down below
for people is there anything else besides your youtube channels that people can go to to follow
more what you're doing coffee zilla is where i'm posting right now coffee break if you want to
watch the video essays that we talked about and that's about it man cool dude well thank you again
