If I was to give you any advice as to where your headphones as low volume as you can because
memorize on the power pig and stuff and I just had those motherfuckers just jacked up
and be like ball of love sponge here's a brand new one from Janet Jackson and I just had
him jacked the fuck up and an old timer back in the day is like looking kid I was like
21 22 and you know fucking slinging it and it was like you need to turn your volume on
your headphones down because when you get older you know and so you know you're having
headphones in an enclosed environment it's not healthy for your ears and now I'm having
ear issues like big time years my ears already fucking ring all the time yeah you might have
your headphones how how how hot how loud do you put put your head they're pretty fucking
hot right let me hear him let me hear him here try my I bet you no guest has ever done
this with you know how no no one ever I'm so thankful you're doing it too hot too hot way
too hot okay okay like for like you need to go like for yeah like I don't have a longer
perfect maybe Matt Stone maybe Matt Cox maybe Matt Cox had him on before you know and little
motherfucker we got to find him a leg extended surgeon I mean listen do you think you're
if your surgeon buddy can do it who does the fake tits no that's that is probably such
an aggressive oh yeah potentially problematic surgery first of all you'd sit the kid down
and say listen Matt you're a good looking guy I mean he's good looking guys I mean like
if you think that chicks are gonna like you cuz you're two inches taller right that shows
you how fucked up you are buddy just keep stealing identities and fucking you know and fucking
faking a funk you do that well but you really do and you're like what are you a fucking painter
now or some bullshit yeah he paints I had him listen in full disclosure I picked him
all I saw I somebody turned me on to concrete about two years ago by the way my new favorite
guess is that motherfucker that goes into and gets 250 Bibles from the janitor and cuts
out the pages and I found that mother that guy's fucking brilliant yeah he's a trip isn't
he cut is he gonna be okay as I mean I think he's on probation now is he not yeah I think
he's on probation but I think he's doing better I mean he seems alright you know what the funny
thing is about that if you read the comments of that podcast they're ripping me so fucking
hard they're rip because I think there was one point where I asked him a question he
answered it and then I asked him the same fucking question like 20 minutes later because
literally so so Matt had him on his show and he's like Danny this guy's great there's only
like two or three you know Matt Cox has got a show Matt well Matt Cox met the guy first
and he caught Matt Cox called me about this guy and he got he's like there's only really
like two or three legit money counterfeiters that I've ever been like prosecuted like this
guy do you know I got in trouble for that no I didn't have no idea that's a story we
need to get in really yeah so he calls me up and I'm fucking drunk at my buddy's house
and I'm like this was like four in the afternoon and this guy wanted to come at like six so
I came I had no idea anything about the guy I don't know anything about counterfeiters
I'm drunk I just show up here two hours later and I'm fucking just trying to sober myself
up and talk to him I thought your interview nailed it oh that I thought you fucking nailed
it thank you I don't know that you get near the credit like I mean within the Tampa world
now I know we're glow you know we think globally in podcasting and then on YouTube but you're
a Tampa guy you know and maybe more specifically a Pinellas County guy oh yeah born and raised
I mean like there's two different distinct people there's a people that live in Hillsborough
and then there's kind of the Pinellas Beach life so to speak exactly but I don't know if
you get the credit of having as large of a of a YouTube channel is I mean Cletus McFarlane
obviously killing it and and and what a good guy have you had him on no I'd love to have
him on oh but I mean there's not a lot of people that have your numbers in Tampa I mean
yeah I don't know you get near there nobody knows who Danny motherfucking Jones is no we
need to get your brand out we need to get your brand use a regular clean cut good-looking
kid well thank you man I mean yeah I my life is super boring man all I do is this and only
is your head is your headphones yeah exactly yeah and raise your toddler you had a toddler
yeah I've been in the fucking well I've been in the pool that's my eyes are all fucking
red hold your kid that miss with my gummy that I ate this morning but he's uh he's two years
old and oh it's a boy he's a boy thank God yeah and I got another one doing September
oh is it a boy or girl cool all right you're good I kind of want to have a girl to bounce
it out so you might want to stop now okay I mean just take it from an old timer here
two's enough okay okay kids are fucking how many kids you have one you have one okay he
how old is he like 20 he's gonna be 20 in June and it doesn't get any easier you know
here's the deal here's the whole kid timeline yeah they absolutely love you you're the fucking
man until they get to be about 13 then all of a sudden you're no longer the you know
dad dad's the coolest motherfucker ever to live right until they get to be about 12 13 and
then you know they they they need you less and less and less and then they describe
they they you know the boys find some pussy right and then it's yeah it's all over but
the fucking crime it's all over just remember you know some things when the when the battle
but pussy wins the war yes I mean look at the decisions we collectively have made in
lieu of pussy you know what I was talking to have you ever seen that show Westworld on
HBO yeah fucking good is that show oh it's great there's that one point I've been thinking
about this nonstop for the past fucking three weeks ever since he said it when the old guy
on that movie the guy Hannibal forget his fucking name Anthony Hopkins he says look
at Mozart look at Michelangelo look at the the fucking Eiffel Tower the Empire State
Building all of the most brilliant literature and art architecture in the world and you
think the human intellect is nothing but peacock feathers just an extravagant mating
call yeah all the most crazy fucking inventions or art that's ever been created by human beings
is all just been some extravagant elaborate mating call and so if you think about it growing
up what is our now okay let's let's say it's whomever you're attracted to in today's age
we can't assume that it's a guy girl girl guy we have to assume that there's guy guy
stuff there's girl girl stuff and if you're over 18 love whoever the fuck you want that's
that's your product I mean like I'm not here to tell you and judge you that heterosexuality
is the only way to go I mean fuck well you can you can transition into what you want
you can be what you want you know that's that's a whole different world but with regards to
let's just say the way Bubba and Danny's wired everything we do up to a certain point is
to batter ourselves with pussy if we didn't have if you and I didn't have a sex drive
so to speak I would rather just hang out you and I have more in common talking about you
know ballgame and bullshit like that than some chick it's into the day the only reason
we have her hauling around the buckle brushes because we want to fuck her one reason we drive
listen if I didn't care about what a girl thinks about the kind of car I drive you and
I'd be rolling around in a fucking 04 crown Vic we don't give fuck about it but we do
everything in lieu of that pussy but we come up with stories to come up with like stories
to prove that that's not why it really but it really is it really is it's it's into the
fucking day on musk you think well that's a different character I mean that motherfucker
doesn't care about nothing I think that he's the most brilliant man in the planet I really
do I mean fuck that guy's just got some type of it swagger that we haven't ever seen I mean fuck
he doesn't even have a house you don't give a fuck about nothing I mean think about if you're
the richest man in the world you don't give a fuck it's like completely reverse of Matt Cox
Matt Cox worries about everything including how big his fucking shin bones are okay Elyon
musk and by the way I always I always mispronounce his name on purpose just like I know Illinois
is Illinois with the eye but I call it Illinois because it's just my bubba charm I call corn on
the cob corns on the cobs just because it's my white trash fucking you know in my cult like
bubble army following nose that I fucking but I call him Elyon musk Elyon musk is the most
richest motherfucker in the world if I was the richest dude in the world motherfucker I would
have a house that made Ben mallers look like fucking you know the maids quarters right Elyon
musk doesn't even have a house he fucking crashes on people's couches that's how much
fucking swagger he's got right if you were the richest man in the world Danny Jones what kind
of house would you have yeah no I have a staff of 50 just telling you how fucking big your dick
is and how much money you got hey guy I'm paying 100,000 tell me how much money I got right now
and how big my cock is and how many girls are coming over like Bubba Balzerian almost right
like you know like you know like that guy that guy's a fraud anyway haven't they come up the
day that Balzerian maybe like it might be like all kind of smoke and mirrors a little bit with
him I don't know have they think you might want that might want to be one of your next things
you look into look that up Austin we can look it up right now immediately Austin fuck fucking
right now no I think well he does I think he rents a lot of the houses he lives in any of
the thoughts I've already defaulted on some of the shit and gotten thrown out of these big
houses you know he went to Admiral Farragut right yeah yeah and his dad was they were from Tampa
and yeah dad was a big fraudster I think right I got fucking he was like a Bernie Madoff
type yeah I went to prison and shit this episode of the podcast is brought to you by versus game

me right the fuck no it's fucking great it will why jack you up oh shit is it legal yeah it's legal
it's like a main line of adrenaline right to your brain right before I hit the fucking air I know
right hold on three two six oh five usually I'm down to see this this is old this one you
do a 30 milligram adder all to get that effect oh yeah I hit it oh man don't be a pussy about it
Danny Jones hand the fucking heat over here cousin you gotta get it it's legal it's an old one yeah
we gotta get a fresh one you just kind of shake it up yeah yeah yeah yeah see I already know
my show too I got the bubble a little sponge oh yeah so let me ask you a question why the fuck did
you I mean seriously why did you have me on here you got like you're a fucking legend I don't know
you're thinking so I mean for real dude you are definitely one of the the most iconic people to
ever come out of Florida that I that I know I remember being like 16 17 years old in the back of
a fucking construction van going to work every day every single morning here and you come on the
radio at 6 a.m well I'm fucking half brain dead asleep riding the Sarasota listening to you for
two fucking hours and I would always wonder the one thing about you that always fucking like
perplexed me was this guy is 6 a.m sharp as a fucking tack and I didn't even have any of
these fucking smelling salts fucking rip roaring at 6 a.m every fucking day of the week like this
guy's got some discipline and you know the thing about it is thank you for recognizing that but
in this form form that we're doing podcast it is kind of the reverse of what what radio
is or was where radio was high energy boom boom boom boom non-stop fast form and podcasting slows
it way down and lets you kind of totally you know this is like slow fucking this is fuck podcasting
is fucking when you're 40 and radios fucking when you're 18 because when you're 18 you know you're
and when you're 40 you know you're not even 40 yet are you no no you're like 34
you just if I can get it in there yeah and so that's kind of the difference and
I've been doing radio now for 35 years and you know thank you for for saying what you did I
radio has changed I'm locally heard on an am station and but you know I made the digital
switch so to speak in 17 and I kind I really feel sorry for the regular radio guys out there
that just have one regular show and have no other forms of distribution because they're
radio is dead I mean radio I mean it's the it is the it's the it's the bag phone so to speak you
know I mean look how cell phone technology has gone from remember when you first maybe you don't
even remember this Danny but when you were when you were a pimp back in like 85 or 6 if you wanted
a cell phone you literally had to have a fucking bag like like literally a backpack and the phone
was in there and like you're a military guy and you had to zip that motherfucker up so that's what
radio is now compared to what the digital world is you know YouTube you know podcasting you know
all the other different algorithms and and and how you how you distribute con con it's
it's still the expression content is king how you distribute your content changes daily and people
like you you know you probably are way more powerful in your distribution method of your
content than any of the highest rated air personality in Tampa doesn't have your reach by far
that's so fascinating to me because sometimes when I'll turn on the radio I listen to it whether
it be one I think it's one or two five that I put on the other day and and you listen to them
talk for for five minutes and then it's a fucking 30 minutes of commercials right how the fuck are
they getting all these ads and well through agencies and and that are paying and who's paying
for that nobody I mean digital has digital has cannibalized radio by like 65 70 percent and
the bottom line is that these regular local radio guys are talking to only Tampa and the highest
rated radio personality at any one time might have 40,000 people listening to them at one
particular time in a fit in a 15 minute period they break it up in quarter hours so it's called
time spent listening but like so you know the the highest rated guy in the morning might have
40 to 60,000 people listening at any time look at your numbers I mean look at big podcasting
numbers and people on Spotify and Rogan and you know other things like that you know Cletus you
know I just I mean people don't really realize how powerful and and quite frankly I'm not trying to
make this the day the Danny Jones blow up your ass special but you you you really have established
you know a great a great thing here you really have being from a radio guy I mean I know you
looked at me like oh my god but our radio world has changed radio guys would love to be you right now
that's so real like and I don't know that if a radio if you've really had a radio guy on here
never that really knows it the way I do but you've reverse engineered the whole thing by creating
this digital real estate that you have in platform and delivery mechanism your numbers I mean I know
I kind of had we talked to numbers a little bit earlier and there's nobody in radio making that
type of of digital money none not one but also the podcast market is so oversaturated too there's
every single it is a fucking podcast but it's not oversaturated with good stuff it's saturated
with shit and so content is king quality is king you have what half a million subscribers on YouTube
people look at that and and and and gravate gravitate to that you know like one thing I'll
look at is I'm going through the YouTube world is I instantaneously look at how many subscribers
they had that legitimizes that particular channel right so I got a guy that's got 35 you know but
you know you have you know some huge numbers so it is it's oversaturated and it's it's a bubble
it's gonna I think the podcasting world's gonna burst like the dot-com bubble did really I do but
I think that the people that have that are big players in there obviously will stick around
and will be will benefit because we'll weed out all the shit and people and people have the biggest
misconception of podcasting people like oh I'm gonna start a podcast and I'm gonna start making
five grand a month okay buddy yeah you know like it's a it's a slow burn in order to inevitably
be able to establish great clients like liquid depth and and those these aren't sponsored I just
bought this for fun just to fuck with people oh well you know what you should see this is where
you're from people like you that appreciate this kind of stuff not many guests will appreciate
this yeah but here's where you're fucking up is you should take this our video air check of us doing
that oh yeah and send it to him and say hey I I use your product that's what I do a lot of times
I use your product I had a guest who's well known as well he loves it we'd love to endorse your product
boom see I need that entrepreneurial mind and so and so you know say listen um and and if anything
you'll get free product if anything you'll get free product you own your own content now in radio
you get into plug-hole and play oh play over scenarios with that if you don't own your own
content where you know where rate a regular radio guy let's say you know uh Drew Garabbo
who I love by the way you know he couldn't uh because he has a Cox contract couldn't be drinking
liquid death because he went to the store and bought it and then throw it out and then get a
hold of him liquid death privately and say hey would you want to know that I don't have to aggregate
through Cox and Cox would get their little hands in it in a whole nine yards but you on the other
hand or me who own our own content and distributed our way we have every right to reach out to the
liquid death so the monsters are this guy here and so honestly you should have is that Justin back
there that's uh Austin Austin Justin Austin same thing take the cut up the clip of us talking about
this doing the hits send it to him and be like man what who else is doing that right right you know
give me uh give me uh you know five six hundred a month sponsorship and uh all the stuff I could
snort and let's let's call it a see I think one of the good things I think about like the evolution
from the old school way of of uh entertainment like radio or tv or movies it's still like that
obviously with tv and movies is the whole gatekeeper mentality like you can't it takes it's so hard
to break through in like television or in the film industry uh especially now but forever and I'm
sure it was just like that with radio like you no one could grab a microphone and just start
talking no like they're they're these gatekeepers of of old guys in suits who are have you know
their buddy buddies with these advertising agencies and they all all they care about is money right
is this guy pretty does he have a nice chin and is he gonna or who's he know or who's his agent
or who represents him and you know did I go out golfing with his agent last week yeah you know
they say that realistically you know 50% of business gets cut on the golf course these
executives that are golfing and out you know and so this world doesn't rely on that you know
I did not I stumbled upon your podcast through a person that I my agent Tom Bean happened to
watch the Matt Cox uh pot the very first time he was on yeah that was the most popular one right
and he reaches out to me my agent and says hey you might want to get this guy on so I was like
well where where can I see a stuff there's this uh thing called concrete spelled with a K go look
at that and so I and and now my co-host Anna Hummel in full disclosure your podcast is one of her
favorite podcasts really to the point where she got into a fucking huge concrete rabbit hole a few
nights ago we talked about this on my show I need to actually have my producers pull the clip we've
been talking about you guys a lot on my show the concrete podcast and she's like we opened the show
up a couple mornings ago and she's like oh my god I got into this concrete podcast deal and they
were talking about this one dude who uh followed these people around in West Virginia oh yeah yeah
Mark Lado yeah and she was so she was watching the Mark Lado deal so then she started getting into
that and then she got into the Whittakers of of West Virginia and so your podcast got her into
this rabbit hole and so you're doing great things here and you know I I want to help you if and what
I can do like things like like what I just showed you how to do that but I also want you to help me
because I think together we could do some good shit together oh hell yeah hell yeah I mean I'm
ahead of you maybe in branding in the knowledge of radio but fuck you are way ahead of me on in
this world well you're you're you are leaps and bounds ahead of anybody when it just comes to just
you're just such an interesting like personality and you're so charismatic and you're so good at
talking you're so good at like developing that rapport with people I'm fucking dog shit at that
like I I came up just holding a video camera making my own little documentary films and like
little TV like pilots and shit but you got to get factor no and I and I just I wanted enough I
disagree that your dog shit on that I disagree well I've gotten a little bit better I mean you're
interviewing me and I think you're killing it well thank you I mean you're so like you know I
think that I think that you I mean you're I really really think that together you know we could do
some good shit together how did you I don't think I don't know if you've ever done this I don't know
if there's any like sort of like sequential documentary of your life anywhere there's and
there's actually a couple things being shot right now uh I'm shooting one documentary called
video killed the radio star which is I think about the most fucking brilliant you know the
Hulk Hogan sex tape really fucked up my life it really did and a lot of people don't know the
truth to that if you were to go ask let's say that you two guys are walking down the international
mall or anywhere for that fucking matter does anybody go to the fucking to the Pinellas uh
what's the seminal uh what's Tyrone does anybody go to Tyrone mall anymore I don't know but if you're
hanging out on the BH or something amongst you know men 25 to 54 and you walk up to anybody in
Tampa Florida or maybe the world for that most part and you're like hey what do you know about
the Hogan sex tape and they're gonna say oh his best friend Bob of the Love Sponge uh taped
Hogan fucking his wife and then Bubba tried to sell it and do him dirty there's truth to that
I did let him fuck my wife and my home surveillance system got captivated it as it captivates
everything that's the my own that's my only dabbling in the whole thing the sequence of events that
happened thereafter will absolutely blow people's fucking minds when they find out how this all
went down now I'm not trying to say oh listen I'm innocent no no I let my best friend fuck my hot wife
I did my best friend was in a which that's not I mean if everyone's willing and there's nothing
wrong with that there's three willing participants and really at the end of the day had an employee
of mine not steal my fucking my surveillance uh only three people to this day would still know
about that event and my life wouldn't have been ruined uh my ex-wife wouldn't be considered a whore
and Hogan wouldn't have 141 million dollars in his pocket so I mean jokes on me motherfucker I mean
did he really got all that money no he didn't he got I and in my opinion in my opinion between
now there were no don't forget there were two lawsuits there was Hogan vs Gawker and then the
lawsuit that nobody knows about Hogan vs Cox okay this all of this was aggregated through Cox Media
people don't that lawsuit settled that lawsuit settled that's the story I'm gonna tell I'm gonna
tell that story everybody knows Hogan vs Gawker and how that worked out but if you were to go and ask
that people say well people don't realize is that my best friend Hulk Hogan lived with me
at his lowest point of his life in 2007 he was suicidal I had to take a gun away from him at
one time he was he was he was going to kill himself and we were coming home from the dollhouse one
night my wife and I had a a semi open relation I mean you know we were we were I wouldn't say we
didn't necessarily in the lifestyle but you know I'm not a jealous guy I've I've seen through all
of my years on being on radio and you know the the squirt Olympics and the girls pissing and
fucking coffee cans and shooting ping pong balls out their pussies and just all the stuff that I've
seen you know I've become callous so my best friend fucking my wife is not that big a deal to me
and so you guys were married we were together yeah we were married and and and so we're driving
on from the dollhouse and my wife calls me and Hogan's down he's going through the worst fucking
divorce ever and I just told I said hey Heather have a little sexy outfit on and and and take
care of my boy when we get home and it was pretty much that it was pretty much that simple um the
the the chain of custody of the tape is a story in itself uh it was we Heather and I were going
through a very nasty divorce and I didn't want that you know that that DVD at my house at that time
so I took it and put it in my office and an employee stole it and the rest is history then
employee disseminated it the employee used it to try to extort Hogan for a million dollars there was
an FBI did you know that there was an FBI sting I had no fucking clue no nobody knows this nobody
knows that this tape was shopped all around Hollywood and everybody in Hollywood asked the
spice boy Mat Lloyd spice boy my co-host was shopping this to digital underground and to
wicked productions and all this and says you know because the sex tape world with the Ray J
and Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton and Tommy Lee you know those those were worth millions of dollars
because people the people in the in the tapes agreed you know for the right at the end of the day
right Pam and Tommy when I act like they didn't they made a lot of money on that deal well
Heather myself or Hogan was sex tape hasn't made money yeah right I'm I'm the I'm the guy I'm the
person that's been on the worst side of sex tape I'm the I am the fucking the guy who got butt
fucked by sex by sex tapes so as spice boy was shopping this this tape I didn't even know that
it was gone you know like for instance see that toolbox over there yeah okay you might have three
half inch wrenches in there do you really know that there's three in there last time you checked
there was three but do you go back every day and check that there's three half inch wrenches right
no I knew my this I knew this sex tape was in my office in in the desk I didn't go every day and
relook oh it's still there I just knew I never had an employee theft program problem I didn't
you know I had nothing I had a pretty small staff and nobody went in my office and I'd never
have a theft problem people had keys to the building they could come and work on the weekends
and things like that well one of my employees stole it I didn't know it was stolen until one of my
producers Brent Hatley calls me March 4th 2011 and flat out asks me did did Hogan fuck your wife
and I'm like I'm driving into work it's 4 40 in the morning I'm on the Howard Franklin I'm like
what are you talking about he's like on the dirty.com there's a screenshot of your bedroom
with Hogan you know on top of on top of Heather and I'm like oh my god Brent Brent run into my
office right now and look at my top desk top drawer under some papers there should be a DVD
that says Hogan on it and he walked in there and came he said it's not there am I I knew him I knew
I knew I knew my life was ruined so spice boy was taking this tape and and when he was going to
digit when he was going to all these places that could potentially buy a sex tape the first thing
they asked was well do you have 2257 forms on the people involved and a 2257 form is just a
standardized form that says I am this person giving you permission to use my likeness and
distribute it and we own the right you know that kind of bullshit which you should have me sign
at the end of the day I actually know I don't have anybody sign those you should yeah you know what
I'll give you if anybody ever told me they didn't want to be on here I would take it down sure but
you know if you have a 2257 further insulates yeah you know I mean that would be a good idea
that would be a responsible thing to do I have a four I'll have oh really yeah I have the I have
the the template okay to speak I can get you oh that would be fucking awesome and and and then and
you tell them you know you can either put in the form or you can tell them hey this is just gives
me the rights to put this on but if you'd ever have a problem with it I'll take it down right
like you know like be disarming when you right because if they look like it looks a little
intimidating you know sign in some shit right but other radio lesson right I could teach you
a lot of lessons I know I'm learning a lot today and my next lesson is get a vasectomy okay now let's
let's let's keep it at two let's keep it at two you want to keep this empire going motherfucker you
get another mouth to feed then you got to figure you and your wife are going to end up getting a
divorce one of these days fucking three child support payments instead of two fuck you know
that's my baby mama drama she always says that she goes she goes I'm never letting you divorce me
but I don't care what the fuck happens when we get older she's like you're getting a vasectomy
after our next kid after three kids because I don't want any other bitch to have your kids
that's her way of looking at it that's her way that's quite that's that's a lot of wisdom right
there you might want to listen to old girl on that one yeah but you might want to try to
whittle her down let's keep it at two I'm just saying I know yeah I'm trying to I'm working on
child support's strictly a number it's 20% of your gross per kid think about 20% per kid per kid
by oh god you're looking at 60 points 60% of everything yeah yeah yeah damn yeah homeboys
thinking about his job right I see why Hogan was suicidal yeah well I mean Linda got I mean fuck
well I mean his divorce settlement was just crazy so anyway um uh spice boy starts shopping this
tape he can't find anybody in Hollywood or anybody in the porn industry they'll touch it
they're like listen we cannot put we cannot put this up if you don't have you know at least Heather
and Hogan on 2257s right it's illegal well um at that point he the tape was worth nothing
so he then this is this will dig this dandy this will blow your fucking mind and this is what people
in the mall and and don't know is that he then got ahold of his wife's best friend who named
Laurie Burbage who looked worked at the bank of America she was just making like you know 2020
like a single mom and gave her a thousand dollars to be uh the liaison and he called up a guy named
Keith Davidson who was the number one sex tape broker in Hollywood I've heard of him and he came
he flew to Tampa and brokered this and he had David Houston who's Hogan's lawyer who's now dad
and Hogan is that the guy looks like a burn victim yeah it looks like fire marshal bill oh my god let
I got so much heat when he died yeah he died in Reno oh fuck and so uh him and Hogan uh
Keith Davidson got ahold of him and Hogan and said we have the sex tape I have the sex tape
well first of all the dirty.com print put put the screenshot of it up in March and kind of
alerted the world that it was out there so everybody's scrambling around where the fuck is it nobody
knows they can't produce it the dirty.com has to pull it down immediately but but but spice
boy fucked up by I think I like I think he got like 45 hundred dollars to send them that just that
picture so as he's shopping and he can't sell it he then arranges a meeting to for Keith Davidson
to represent him and Hogan David Houston and Laurie Burbage who represents the owner of the tape
because if spice boy would have walked in there Hogan would have said fuck
because they knew he knew spice boy worked for me right you know he spice boy wanted to completely
stay out of it right so Laurie Burbage goes in representing the owner of the tape Keith Davidson's
in there they're brokerate but what they don't know is that Hogan and David Houston called the FBI
and said we're being extorted they want a million dollars for the sex tape that for Hogan to buy back
so that it doesn't get out that's what bad guys do is if I got something here and you don't want
this you don't want your wife to see this well then buy it off of me bitch right right otherwise
she's gonna get it now that was true somebody did try to extort it for a million true it's and it's
and it was an FBI sting that's been fully documented video really they have it like
recorded him actually saying that yes wow I'll have that footage on my documentary wow so they're
in there and Hogan writes a dummy check for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to buy back this
tape the feds knocked the door down fucking put Laurie Burbage and Michael Dave Keith Davidson
in handcuffs oh this kid's fucked up Dan you're gonna fucking freak out over this deal so the FBI
does this big sting the whole fucking nine yards Keith Davidson's lawyers up and hires a guy named
Brian Albritton now Brian Albritton was my original attorney when I got in trouble for the hog
situation remember my hog day oh yeah he was my first attorney so now but he now when each new
president comes in they uh appoint a US attorney for the district in Florida there's three districts
the upper the middle and the lower well that is you're basically the US attorney for the middle
you know you decide what the federal prop the federal government prosecutes well Brian Albritton
after he became my attorney under the George W. Bush administration was a big slinging dick he
worked for Holland and Knight he was the US attorney for six years in Tampa so he was the you know
the big slinging dick this guy named Brian Albritton well after George W. Bush left and Obama came in
then they appoint a new US attorney it's all politics well Brian Albritton if you're a former
US attorney after a year or 18 months you then you can then go into the private world sector
and be a regular lawyer so what do bad guys do when they're in trouble if you got the opportunity
to hire the former US attorney who just left that office who has all of his boys acted who do you
hire you hire that guy right right so Michael Davidson hires Brian Albritton to represent him
Brian Albritton walks into the US attorney's office a guy named Lee Bentley now okay I'm sorry
Robert Robert O'Neill and he Robert O'Neill is the US attorney and he was formerly Brian Albritton's
assistant so that's his boy so Brian Albritton goes and says listen you got a pro wrestler
and you got a fucking shock jock both are incredible witnesses this is going to be a
fucking clown show you can't press charges on these people they know prostit they know processed it
what does that mean they didn't prosecute they didn't attempt oh they said no so it didn't get
pro Matt Lloyd spice boy Lloyd Burbage Michael Davidson Keith Davidson all the people that
extorted Hogan got away with it because I was the victim because I'm a bad guy I'm the loudmouth
I'm the guy that lesbian Tuesdays no panties Thursday Redneck Mondays Squirrel Squirrel
you know squirt squirt Olympics shoot ping pong's out your pussy ping pong and that guy
doesn't make a good victim you could do whatever the fuck you want to me but they're never they
they never will prosecute for me so it got unprosecuted so here it gets better so Matt Lloyd
spice boy gets away with it he basically gets away with it I'm still doing mornings on the bone
and now I have been and my count is doing afternoons and I'm still the morning man but I'm now kind
of the fucking piece of shit because America or corporate they don't know about this failed
extortion attempt because there was no charges brought so what are you talking about it no I'm
really not talking about it because I don't know about it because it takes a year for that shit to
get out you know for and I didn't even really know about it until Hogan sued Gawker and I'm in a
deposition and they start asking me all these questions and I'm like what huh and so um uh spice
boy then takes this tape he's cleared no big deal and it's no value there is no value to this tape
you can't extort Hogan for it right because you almost went to prison for that deal you can't get
anybody to buy it so the only value it is is to get me fired over it and for Mike Calta to get
mornings on the bone and so spice boy gives it to Mike Calta Mike Calta gives it to his agent Tony
Burton and Tony Burton hand delivers it to Gawker Gawker publishes is it I get fired and the bone
promotes Calta and he's still there to that day he's still the number one morning man in Tampa
which I used to be and he used my sex tape to fucking do it and I'm going to tell that story
it's a story that nobody in this room did you know that I had no fucking clue I knew he was somehow
involved but I didn't know the details yeah and so Hogan then sued Gawker was awarded 141 million
collected 35 million because they filed bankruptcy and he was the largest creditor so got 35 million
there I was heard after Peter Thale and all the I heard that Hogan put about 10 and this is just
strictly my opinion I heard Hogan put about 10 million in his pocket for that after I was all
shut down then he sued was brilliant he sued Cox separately for the distribution you know of of
of how it got out and in if you one of the maybe my next appearance if you go to the Pinellas County
court doc and you look up Hogan versus Cox and you and you read the complaint you can it shows you
know it lays it right on that's basically what my documentary is going to be is the following the
is is following the complaint and Cox I heard and this is just strictly hearsay okay that Cox
wrote Hogan a 50 million dollar plus check wow for because Hogan had evidence of this tape now here's
the bad thing about it is Spice Boy quit my show in February of 2011 stole the tape shopped it to the
dirty and then so this this this tape appeared after he quit my show and he quit my show on great
terms we were like he was like I'm gonna go he quit my show I remember when he quit yeah and he
went to go do nights on the car on on the bone and it was a big thing it was like hey you're
leaving my show but you're going to do your own show my agent even cut his deal for him for free
just because I mean we that was my guy right it's my guy right I didn't know that he what he took on
on on his exit plan so you know um he distribute you know he distributed it all and they Cox did
fire him but you know for years I was the bad guy the bad guy and in the evidence that Hogan had
in Hogan versus Cox I uh I invite anybody to go to the Pinellas County Court record system and
just type in Hogan versus Cox and read the complaint it will blow your fucking mind that Hogan had
the fact that Cox actually had this tape on their servers and the management would look at it Cox
management would look at this watch this Hogan fucking my wife tape while I worked there the
ongoing joke behind my back while I was working there was hey have you seen the fucking tape
so then the guy that they find so Calta's agent Tony Burton spins it to Cox that you can't have
this guy as your morning guy he's a pornographer he let you know his wife fuck Hogan he tried to do
best friend dirty I mean you can't have that clients are going to be falling off nobody wants
to be associated with that guy so they fired me and they promoted the guy at the end of the day
they had to write a 50 million dollar what I was told a 50 million dollar and that motherfucker is
still there to this day and I am still the motherfucker in the whole entire world everybody
thinks I did it that is so fucking bizarre I mean it's so bizarre let me give you a an example
that you might be able to wrap your fucking head around and to and take the bubba factor out of it
you know mark Wilson on channel 13 no okay mark Wilson channel 13 is the head lead anchor at the
six o'clock you know it's him and Kelly ring like local news yeah local news and I'm just using local
because I thought maybe you would know a little bit about it but like you know I do watch Tucker
every now and again all right we'll go into that later let me use let me use Tucker okay who's a
friend of mine I know very good friend of mine I know call up right now let's say Sean Hannity
you're familiar with that yep Sean Hannity um Tucker and his wife are in an open relationship
and so let's think of somebody super famous that Tucker might know uh Donald Trump okay let's just
use that different players but here's the scenario so Tucker lets Trump fuck his wife right there's
video of it it's not going anywhere it's you know it's just it's not going to go anywhere
Hannity fucking wants Tucker's job so Hannity steals the tape he starts shopping it around
and everybody's like fuck we can't we can't we do you got consent forms for you know Tucker's
wife and Trump no uh sorry we can't do anything about it okay the FBI does a sting and fucking goes
and and and uh Tucker's liaison tries I mean I mean uh Sean Hannity's liaison tries to shake
Tucker down for a million dollars the FBI gets involved people get arrested but the FBI is like
listen you got Donald Trump here you got fucking Tucker it's a fucking right wing I can shit storm
here we're not going to prosecute this okay right all right Hannity's like fuck it didn't work there
so Hannity goes to Fox and Hannity then you know or no Hannity goes to CNN and says hey I got a
tape for you guys might want to fucking play it CNN plays the shit out of it right boom Fox fires
Tucker and gives Hannity the job and then five years later realizes that Hannity is the one
that distributed it but let's Hannity keeps his job yeah I mean it's the same thing it's the same
thing almost much bigger players you know a little more sexier not at the time at the time it was
probably about equivalent I mean you were much bigger than Tucker back then yeah one of the reasons
why Tucker was on my show every Tuesday for five years is because we were globally bigger than him
he was I had no clue who Tucker was when he was on your show I just knew that he was this great
fucking guest who would come on he was the best he'd be like uh and and he got in a lot of trouble
for his appearances because he was so cynical and so funny he'd be like let me tell you about Iranian
women if they're not out you know fucking camels they have hair underneath their arms you know and
then you know and now he's gotten in trouble over all of his appearances on my show right you know
but like uh same same you know same scenario but just different players that would never ever in a
million years last people would not fucking tolerate that no Fox would not go for that why did I it's
just it blows my mind that listen I am a bad guy I've done a lot of fucked up shit I'm the second
highest defined radio personality in the in the history of radio that's a good fucking thing I yeah
I've uh you know I'm second to Howard right right second to Howard um I have you know been
let me ask you this Danny and you've had a lot of criminals and people that have been in trouble
on your show how many of your guests have been on trial four times jury trial four times and are
four and oh you're probably the only one I'm 100% the only one yeah I've been on trial four times
and have never lost jury trial where I have jury of my peers in my community that have let me free
every fucking time four times I've been on trial four fucking times if that doesn't show you the
society fucking absolutely has me all wrong and when I'm judged by impartial people on whatever
I've been trumped up on I've I'm not the fucking piece of shit that people think I am and you got
a really good lawyer I got great lawyers when I came into the power pig I said I got my lawyers
and my lesbians that's all I need in life lawyers and lesbians that's all you need
there's a little truth to that I mean you know power pig is such a good fucking name just power pig
Boba there Boba speaking what's your name um Lisa mellow Lisa how old are you 12
call me in six years when you got pubic hair bitch hang up bam I had a 52 share at night
hello power pig Boba what um uh my grandpa died last week here's what an infamous call which I wish

bullshit song and uh can you play that for me because my family's all gathered around right now

were you there at the burial yes did you guys put a boombox in there at all like was there a boombox
or a radio uh no well then how the fucking grandpa Fred here the song we're gonna play and this is
all for selfish reasons to make you guys feel good the bottom line is you just have to deal with
the grandpa Fred took a lick he's dead he's not gonna fucking hear the song and I ain't playing it
get off my fucking phone that's the shit that I would do so and I had a 54 share because nobody
in radio had to balls to do it and be like you know just you know shit hey who's this this is Johnny

one or two five and all those networks you still own it I owned it all really I would my agent Tom
Bean was so brilliant I was an independent contractor that licensed my show to them for the term of my
contract and they had the right to broadcast my material but the minute that I was no longer
employed they had no they had no right to it wow to distribute it anyway and I had and so I have
I have all of that I just need a guy like you to help me out and to get it out

I'm losing weight so that'll give me something when I can finally wear my concrete hoodie I'll
make a big deal are you always trying different diets and shit still my I remember when back when
I listen to you were always trying different shit yeah I'm only me aren't we all I mean
you know I mean you're trying this shit right that's my diet when you're fat you're always trying
like you know yeah I just I've always been I've always either been big like I played football
and big but then I got real fucking fat radio when I got when I was fat yeah because when I was
on the power pig you know it was like we were and you know Matt Heller from horn horn blasters
no I want to look him up okay he's a fucking stud Matt Heller he owns horn blasters okay you
know those big train horns that people put oh yeah he owns that this motherfucker like hangs out with
the Gronkowski's and he probably travels in some of the same circles like T foo and some of that
shit but um Matt what was I talking about Matt Heller um fuck diet we're talking about diet like
eating and shit and he was one of I don't know how we got to remember about Matt Heller I forget
no fuck I completely said radio we started getting radios when he started getting fat
and he started going on heller yeah I forget no fuck I forget anyway it doesn't matter so
what it's that fucking sniff shit you got that the fucking the way that you talk to people when
they were used to call in and shit like on the power pig and talking like is that just like an
I know I'm I'm I'm Matt Heller said it best back in the day in Tampa and then I was you know
syndicated in like 12 other cities Miami Orlando Jacksonville you know Fort Walton Beach uh Naples
Fort Myers uh Hartford Connecticut Richmond Virginia uh Cincinnati Ohio San Diego you know so I was
I was syndicated you know while I was doing my morning show on 98 rock and so as you said when
we were you know earlier when you were being that pickup truck and you'd be listening to me
think about it you didn't have a smartphone there was no twitter there was no twitch there was no
youtube there was no instagram there was no spotify there was no nothing I was the form of social
media if you wanted to know what was cool what was happening what was shocking what was sexy
what might be provocative I was your only outlet that's why I got to be so big and so iconic
in in the space that I was is because I was kind of the first form of social media in our little
world in our little microcosm of radio so to speak so when you're in the back of that truck
you know you didn't have your fucking phone to be scrolling through looking at fucking you
know tiktok shit you had to listen to the radio in order to be cool and to know what was going on
and Matt Heller Matt Heller was the one that came up with that he was you know he's super um uh
big on social media I think I think hornblasters has like a million five instagram people and
that's a local deal but I think that that's the I think I don't mean to be narcissistic or bragging
but I think that's kind of right I think that's kind of one of the reasons why I was able to obtain
or get to the status you know that I that I've that I've become or had at one time yeah I think
that's I think that's a hundred percent right I think um you know back in those times like what I
was trying to get at before was like the like your whole personality and the way you come across like
even like being so energetic first thing in the morning and being able to go through these fucking
marathon shows every single morning and and and maintain that energy throughout the whole thing
and I've never done cocaine ever in my life never ever stop I've never done cocaine in my entire life
I didn't think you were on cocaine but I thought you were for sure on Adderall no no never no now
recently I've discovered Adderall but Adderall wasn't a thing until what how many years ago I mean
yeah I'd fucking took Adderall when I was in college in 2007 I knew I knew I didn't I didn't
find out about Adderall till probably five years ago really right I mean I didn't even smoke weed
and I I now love weed but I didn't even try weed until 10 years ago when I was 46 when I prior to
that I was indoctrin like if I was from Warsaw Indiana and like weed was a gateway drug the
minute that you smoked a joint you're gonna be shooting up heroin and so I was like and so
this rock style of this rock star of a lifestyle that I lived and you know I'd be backstage with
motley crew at livestock and I'd be with fucking you know your life I can't believe you never tried
cocaine that's crazy or weed everybody be getting highest fuck even my guys who work for me and I'd
be like uh I don't need that you know I'm just naturally you know high energy and I have the
ability to get to get to you don't need it to turn it on so I tried weed 10 years ago for the first
time I was just telling this conversation last night night of dinner and the the reason why I
didn't like weed is I don't like smoking I think it's dirty I just don't like smoking
my mom and dad smoked when I was a kid growing up they quit but it was just I hated it I hated it
well and Brent Hatley my executive producer remember when they first came out with those
volcano those oh yeah and so and he would have these things and they had these big bags looked
like helium field balloons and you just suck on them so uh in 2012 here I am going through
shit the Hogan tape just broke I'm fucking a basket case I don't know if I'm gonna lose my job
everybody thinks that I I'm the bad guy I'm the one that fucking taped Hogan fucking my wife trying
to get rich you know we've been through that story I'm just going I mean I'm not thinking I'm
thinking I'm gonna kill myself but I'm just at the lowest point in my life and and and you know
my wife I just went through a huge divorce with my wife you know it's just so much uncertainty
that really I needed weed I mean people don't realize how beneficial weed really is oh it's
fucking great I mean like it changed my life and so at 46 here I am going through fucking hell
and finally Brent Hatley my producer comes up with a a way that I don't think is dirty and fucking you
know smelly and like it's a bag he goes bubba how many times like have you taken a helium balloon
and you know and like you did it you talk like Mickey Mouse and shit I ain't goes it's the same
thing so I had this big ass bag so I fucking did the smoke and I was just like and the first thing
that came to my head was what's so bad about this how can this feeling that I have be bad right now
when you're drunk you know I sometimes you want to fight sometimes you you know but I'm like society
has really got this wrong on what this does to you like it doesn't and at that time it kind of
opened up a world of euphoria and and a different dimension of how to look at things
and not be so fucking uptight right it kind of just made me less uptight and gave me a the ability
to cope with kind of what I'm dealing with in somewhat of a of a of a medicinal type way you
know yeah I didn't I wasn't going to go and take antidepressants and you know I'm not I'm not in
all I know I know some people that take you know fucking Zola often all this kind of bullshit just
to me I'm really yeah I'm I'm old school I don't think I don't I don't think you you know a lot
of people get fucked up off that stuff yeah I mean I know some guys take it if they don't they
so they don't premature come you know Zola yeah if you take enough Zola if it makes you I mean you
could fuck all night long really yeah it's kind of by that wall you're gonna you're gonna abuse it I
am gonna abuse it now tanny jones three refills Zola please oh you know you wire your bitch out I
don't need a prescription well yeah you do fuck I guess we can find street yeah yeah street level
shit going on a doctor I mean live in penthouse park we can get exactly yeah exactly exactly
I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy with just some Zoles are you and now are you
are you serious you're micro dosing now yeah really yeah what do you think about that I uh how do
you like it I I love it I love it because it's just it it's uh I don't ever take too much that
that trips me out but I take enough to make kind of fuzz me out I kind of call it kind of like on
the edge yeah on the fence of like tripping too hard yeah I'm not I've not tripped never hallucinated
nope nope I just you know kind of just just a little bit and it just kind of takes the edge off
a little do you do it when you're live when you're on radio oh yeah do you really oh yeah
is it help enhance it all right yeah absolutely yeah it does I mean that with a gummy chaser man
oh my god you'll be fucking the next Howard Stern Danny Jones god Danny Jones will make you a rock
star I mean we gotta work Danny Jones I mean come on we gotta you gotta put some fucking show biz

concrete is a cool name I mean concrete's so good that who gives a fuck about who's Danny Jones is
I agree that's what I'm saying that's what I'm hoping for yeah but when up when uh what I wanted to
get at when you before you started to get like really big on the bone and like one of the things
that made you so interesting to me when you were when I was younger when I was like in my teenage
years working construction listening to you every single morning was that not only were you
super fucking entertaining you always had the craziest fucking people calling in like Tucker
and you had Hulk and Colin every day but on top of that you were known for being this fucking like
like rock star rich person yeah like you're like oh I've got millions in here got a million
dollar mansion I don't know but like this guy's fucking rich as fuck I was rich listen I'm not
trying to brag but that makes you so much more interesting fuck I was doing in my heyday I was
doing five million a year you know I had three or four years at five million you know I mean I had a
fucking plane you know I had fucking yeah I mean and I'm not and I and I say that you know I say
that humbly because I lost it all and I was fucking stupid about it and if I had my mindset today
if I'd started fucking doing weed at 36 I'd probably have half of that left because I'd be like
you don't need to go out and pay cash for a hundred thousand dollar escalade when you can
fucking finance it for fucking two percent you know I'm saying like you know like just stupid
shit you know you don't need how old were you in your like in like the peak of your career well I
would say the peak of my career the money wise you're talking about money wise and like popularity
probably 06 to 12 that six year period when we were heard both on Syria we were afternoon drive on
Howard on Howard 101 so we had Howard's rub and then we and then I was on you know 14 cocks you
know I mean fuck I was making a million five for my Tampa deal I was making 500,000 per affiliate so
500 for Orlando 500 for Jacksonville 500 for Miami 500 for Richmond 500 for Fort Myers and then
Sirius paid me two million you know so I did six years of that so I would say how old how old was I
in 06 I was born in six like was I 40 40 40 years old 40 years old wow 40 years old you know hot
fucking wife you know two kids run around get drunk with Hulk Hogan running around it was such
such a fucking pimp that when I went to the lightning games I parked where the players did
and walked in through the players way that's how I got to the game that's so fucking so and again
I say that so humbly and I wish I would have taken a step back at that time and realized what I had
and how think and been a little more appreciative and thankful for what you know for what I had
and certainly had a better savings program but you were definitely a fucking you're a you're a
fucking an outlier especially when it comes to like this you're not a liar or an outlier
uh no yeah you're you're a liar or not your lawyer I'm brutally honest yeah an outlier but
but like yeah like you it's obvious that you have extreme fucking talent when it comes to you know
this this media form but I wonder like what your perspective is on why you became so fucking successful
do you think it was more of just like this inherent talent or gift that you have or do you
think it was more of just like like the discipline and the hard work and the not quitting I think
it was the first I think that I have an ability to uh to uh communicate to be jovial to be self
deprecating to be make the joke on me but yet be stiff enough to do a good interview and tell a
bitch to go pack sand and get the fuck out of my studio and so kind of like you know I'm kind of like
the like the guy that's running the bulldozer or running an excavator a regular guy I'm a regular
dude you know I and I think I come across as a regular guy that has kind of the it factor that's
a good bullshitter that's a good communicator um and is a risk taker and so where most radio
personalities would be like hey I gotta you know when I was in on the when I was first starting on
the 98 rock I think my base pay early on was like 450 500 which was fuck and this is 1996
you know big money so a lot of guys guys that are making that kind of money or be like well I'm not
going to take any chances to piss off management because I'll lose my gig I'm like fucking I'm
going to go wide open here because it's going to make me more popular and if I can just get
management to stand behind me it'll escalate the fucking rock star popularity deal which
you will equate to more money and I I've always I've always I've always bet on myself I've always
bet on myself and I think that that's you know I'm a risk taker and an outlier and some of the
risks I've taken have been not good for me and and you know but if you look I mean listen I've been
I got fucked up over the Hogan sex tape but you know that might come back and boomerang a back
around to help me when my when the truth gets out I mean I told you the truth and it blew you away
wait till you know Netflix tells the truth you know I'm not gonna do it no I don't know who's
going to do it the documentary game is is a really fucked up game in itself you know it really is
you know we may have to go to some some film festivals or some things like that but we
are in the process of shooting it now and in shooting it we're shopping it as well we have a
there's a ton of people in the streaming space now it's just not Netflix you know Paramount Peacock

whole prank and he fucking cuts a promo on and where's my fucking Rolls Royce where's my fucking
car right exactly we did it we did it a couple time we did it in front of the brown boxer we did
it at Island Way Grill and we did it at the Sam Pearl right anyways I did it at the Sam Pearl I
got caught trying to sneak it back out of the valet garage underneath the Sam Pearl and I'm
fucking with the guy they fucking call the cops and I'm like dude I'm like I this is my friend's
car we're doing this we're doing a whole thing here and long they called the cops anyways to get
trespass trespassing I got like misdemeanor trespassing I still had to go fucking in the
patty wagon to the Clearwater Beach deal straight gangster look at you motherfucker yeah and it ended
up making the video 10 times better because I got fucking arrested right and actually probably
helped and it worked it promoted the fucking show our little show we created life for sale
ended up being a huge boost maybe I need to get arrested I mean that might be you know maybe you
got a hog we can kill anyways that was my story how I get arrested at the Sam Pearl
I don't know where we're going well Sam Pearls where the FBI sting was that was the FBI sting
that boy I can't wait to get that foot I'm I'm having to sue the FBI now for that footage they
won't give it to me because there's a whole big fucking story as to why they won't give it to me
and I can't I mean it's like involving you should make this part of the documentary trying to
sue the FBI yeah we are okay and the reason why you want to hear you want to something
going to blow your fucking mind what do you know why they didn't prosecute Michael
Keith Davidson do you know why is he the broker he's the broker okay so they didn't file charges
but they had a window of opportunity a window of statute of limitations where they could still
you know any any time that they don't press charges on you until your statute of limitations
runs out they can always come back to you and be like you motherfucker we've revisited that and
we're going to go ahead you know like until your statute of limitations ran out they can always
come back and get you um it's been told to me that the reason why they didn't they're not giving me
the tape is because Keith Davidson was Michael Cohen's hit man Michael Cohen with Donald Trump's
personal attorney and when Donald Trump cut all these deals with these girls to keep their mouth
shut the Stormy Daniels the other ones Michael Cohen used Keith Davidson to broker these deals
so when the FBI went to Michael Cohen to get his correspondence with Keith Davidson so that they
could prove Donald Trump because remember the FBI when Trump was in office they were even though
Trump was the president the FBI was bound and determined to fuck with Trump non-stop from the
russian collusion deal to all the fucking shit so they went to the FBI went to Keith Davidson and
said if you don't give us all of your correspondence with Michael Cohen we're going to reopen up the
Hogan extortion deal that's how they got into Michael Cohen's computer and he went to prison
no fucking way over strong-arming Keith Davidson and potentially recharging him with the with the
crime of the sex tape and i'm that's going to be in my documentary no fucking way it's crazy how
big of a deal that Hogan sex tape was man think that was like a nuclear bomb i'm living it i'm
living it the largest uh civil verdict in panellas counties in panellas county you know listen to this
well you might be want me to be a real real motherfucker if you think about this i probably
should be recognized in hollywood as the highest grossing producer of all time my minute and 41
second tape made it made a million dollars a second it made up okay it was a minute 41 pretty
crazy minute 41 it was a minute 41 and it made a hundred and 41 million dollars that's a million
you tell me but scorsese fucking lucas this people that did start that'll make a million a second
that's true that's fucking true the highest profiting film in history in the history and i
owned it and i and guess what i wanted so much not to do with that sex tape that when it started
getting shitty i signed my rights over to hogan and said i don't want to listen terry i don't want
anything to do with this like i so want to not this is so not me uh here i signed i that's probably
the biggest mistake i made i signed the rights over to him i said here because you wanted to
maintain the friendship first i wanted the friendship in my job right and my innocence right i mean
if if i was guilty i would have said fuck that i want to keep i'm going to fucking milk this out
if truly i taped it for profit reasons why would i have signed over the rights within days
over to him why would i have done that right that's the biggest mistake i i should have said
fuck it i'll be the bad guy but i'm going to get paid right yeah you should have been cutthroat
cutthroat fucking yeah cutthroat clam cutthroat clam and and and and now i'm fucking practically
homeless clam say oh my god so have you guys maintained any have you guys no you guys don't
talk at all no and i've reached out to him he won't eat fucking one i mean like no really
nope and it's just like you know and and and he knows that i didn't do it right like he knows
that i didn't do it but in order to maintain public if he becomes my friend again then what's
the first thing the public's going to say those motherfuckers were in on it are they not yeah they're
gonna say like oh now they're friends right it's convenient yeah so i can't win i can't win and
again i don't want anybody to watch this and think that i'm over here fucking belly aching
i've led a good life i've fucking made a lot of mistakes i've mismanaged my money i lost it all
i mean that's kind of the the template of the concrete of the concrete podcast about you know
like look at the guy that was counterfeiting if that motherfucker just would have been a little
smarter not been so greedy he probably would have been better shape same with me i just didn't go
to prison if i would have backed it down a notch been a little more humble realized what i had
a lot of the best stories have the fucking epic downfall i know and they rise from the ashes
and i'm gonna rise i'm going to rise i'm going i mean i almost got my you know i i i i
think i'm i think maybe with people like you and your help and the motherfucker behind the screen
over there jim whatever name is jim bob jim bob polish jew jim bob magilla cuddy jim bob magilla
cuddy johnny right clicker look at him he's a clicking motherfucker look at him look at johnny
right clicker he's he's johnny right clickers on it he's got carpal tunnel in that right hand
calvin carpal look at my man over there hitting switches like a motherfucker but you know i i yeah
man you gotta get a podcast i think i'm a i think i'm a likeable person i think i have a huge brand
that people know i think if you don't know me uh if you spend any time watching me or listening
to me you can see that i'm just kind of a regular dude and uh you know i think i i think i'm gonna get
honest to god danie i think i'm gonna get one more shot at it i think i'm gonna get one more
shot at it because there's just not a lot of compelling people out there no most everything on
the internet or on the radio sucks it's fucking horrible it's true it's fucking horrible it's true
regular radio has killed itself regular radio should have been developing guys like joe rogan
and you and not fucking kicking me out and not turned into a jukebox with 30 000 a year
fucking radio personnel he's going uh that was a tool followed by uh red hot chili peppers come
up here on 97 yopio uh claudie skies today low tonight 74 tomorrow's high 92 i gotta check in
with traffic right now and then after that uh 42 minutes of commercials and then another one from
red hot chili peppers on the new 97 yopio that's how it is there's nobody understand hey this is
above the love sponge and i got two chicks right now the howard franklin are making out topless
and there's a fucking car and they're coming to the station and i'm gonna have them you know shoot
ping pong balls on a certain pieces of parts is right so no one's doing regular radio has thrown
off all of its all of its real talent you know joe rogan would have been just as popular on klsx
in los angeles add but radio station going what a fucking long form talk radio like is he doing his
pod when he came on your show was he doing his podcast already had just started and here's what
he didn't he like the fucking he like the dude was like a fucking encyclopedia talking about things
right so but in 08 i had him on the show which i need to repurpose that video because i think you
could help me with it but he took me aside and when i went up when i walked him out he goes dude
you gotta you got sirius xm you got you know millions of people listening and i contractually
couldn't i could have done you know like when i was on sirius xm i was also doing terrestrial radio
i got to the radio station at at five in the morning and didn't get home till eight at night
because i was doing two shows a day i was doing terrestrial mornings and then afternoon satellite
so i could what does terrestrial mean regular radio regular okay like the bone 98 rock things
like that so i was doing that and then doing a standalone exclusive show for sirius so i was
doing eight nine hours a radio a day a day but joe was at that point saying man after your second
show get two boys together and just bullshit for an hour about anything and put it up as a podcast
and i was like oh joe fuck that podcast right i used to call it podcast willy what am i a podcast
willy guy now are you fucking kidding me that's what i'm regulating on down to where howard shits
on him all the time too oh yeah well he's been shitting on joe for in the pod the whole podcast
thing for years and you know howard and i are still really close are you really i just got a
birthday card from him handwritten when would your birthday april 23rd no way happy birthday thank
you same day a william shakespeare and john sena are born well but um basically the same people
howard howard shits on podcasting because he's kicking himself in the ass for not
doing it when he should just like i you know like anybody that shits on podcasting doesn't eat
kind of is kicking themselves in the ass that they know they should be doing it
you know i'm saying big name people i mean you know there's just no downside not to do it
you know i'm saying i mean it's it's it's an easy setup yeah you know and if you and if you're
compelling you can admit you can make a difference i find it fascinating that that howard hasn't been
on joe's show there and well i have even you being on his fucking show i'm just waiting
till my documentary comes out because i'm gonna i want that one shot like you know how you know
joe's not going to have me on as a regular guest right but i can make a phone call and get on and
so i'm waiting joe yeah can i do the show sure i'm promoting you know i want yeah i want to have
that one you know that one thing that i'm heavily promoting you know by the way your people can come
look at my uh what what what what how should we promote my shit i just go to my youtube channel
i guess well your youtube channel and you have a twitch they got to subscribe to you on twitch
everything uh in my world is at the bub army the bub army have you been banned from twitter
yes yes do you know why see no why remember that global warming bitch that how dare how dare you
that bitch you got 14 year old you know so i got on the air i had like 119,000 100 and i had 131,000
followers on twitter and that's currency man i mean that's worth something you know i mean to to to
promote your other shit and um so i i got on the air and i'll be like
i was like this 14 year old bitch needs to be in school first of all and then i just kept saying
shut up little kid and she would be like how dare you just be like shut up little kid you know
shut up you little bitch you know like you know like like shut up who are you to you know the carbon
footprint you made to get to this summit you know the private plane that you took and the
you know is far more oh she sailed a sailboat didn't she well whatever the fucking bitch shut up
get shut the fuck up you little bitch and that got me thrown off no fucking way yeah maybe that
now the eleon's god and i can get a fucking i can get it back i don't think that might happen
i don't know i don't know and how about that's the problem though that's like social media
has been like a great new microphone for all these people who don't have to worry about gatekeepers
if you have talent you can fucking you can write the best talent rises at the top on social media but
the downside of that is like you were saying you were the one that always pushed the limits didn't
mind didn't care about getting fucking fine or didn't care about keeping your little cushy job
but now on the internet just even on youtube if you go too far just my last fucking podcast
talking about some fucking bill gates conspiracy theory got my fucking the podcast demonetized
i can't make money on that episode let me tell you something you hear this oh i'm i'm the king
of getting demonetized on that shit i mean oh twitch is the worst right well i've learned
to twitch's game i've learned twitch's game but youtube let me tell you something one of my co-hosts
on my show is dr dan diaco he's a doctor and early on during the covet deal dan aggressively treated
covid with the ivy mekton you know di di the horse d1 gimmick he did and he had 200 patients
that he saw and out of 200 all 200 got better so he here's a doctor really here's a doctor
and he gets on the air this is early on yeah but he doesn't need a fucking tit job doctor yeah he is
but he's still a doctor i mean you're not prescribing a control like he's not prescribing
percocets or you know Vicodin it's you know it's so as a doctor you can pretty much prescribe
anything as long as it's not a scheduled narcotic right and you know adibi like dr dan if i get a
if i get a cold or he'll he'll prescribe me some antibiotics nobody's gonna right exactly we're
gonna go to jail because you prescribe some emoxysilin mother right pill mill mother you know
so he was aggressively he came from the school where he thought he had a little cocktail zinc
vitamin b yeah ivy mekton deoxycycline with a with an inhaler kind of do the drip like the vitamin
drip no no just all you know things that you could go to a public's and get a prescription well
he was on my show and and so as a doctor this wasn't his opinion he was giving non-hippo
violations meaning he wasn't given any names of his patients but he was saying hey i have
x amount of patients that i've treated as a doctor myself and here's the results here's what's
happened here's what's this is how i treat them here's you know because it went against wh o guidelines
that youtube suspended me for a week by having a by having a real doctor a not some of the
fucker off the streets a real doctor talk about his real patients and how he's really treating them
because it went against the you know you have to get vaccinated two shots in the fucking arm
i got suspended for youtube from youtube for a week that has happened to lots of doctors for
doing that and that scares the fuck out of me and so like okay if it's their opinion i get it
but if they're giving you real life statistics of their patients right then at that point you're
altering truth you're trying to quell truth and free speech i'll tell you what scares me more than
anything is this fucking quack job that that they just put in for the dismiss information kind of
bullshit oh my god i mean what the fuck is happening i mean and they did what they did that right
after elon put in the bid to buy it by twitter right now okay let's say joe biden is just hell
been on having this bureau which i think this bureau is about as dumb as a fucking bureau
as you could come up with but let's just say that you got to have it i'm joe biden i shit my pants
at noon i eat oatmeal i'm bold as fuck i don't know what i'm doing and i think that you know to
counter the elon musk deal we're going to have our own bureau of misinformation okay i don't think
it's smart but wouldn't you go out and get a real sharp motherfucker like ben Shapiro or a real smart
guy that's really buttoned up and know his shit to run it not some fucking bitch that just does
tiktok mary poppins bullshit like joe yeah we don't think you should do the bureau but if you're
gonna let's find some motherfucker from harvard that really's got his shit together that really
comes across well on camera but not some mary poppins bitch but somebody who's actually smart
who went to harvard who actually does make sense and it's coherent can communicate those type of
people they don't fucking want to be in politics right those type of people would take joe fuck you
exactly this is the slipperyest slope ever i'm not doing it right so they had to get to mary poppins
bitch to even hard sell the fucking stupid job to him right hey we want you to go find out what
they're saying about it and then if it's misinformation possibly get that person thrown
off that platform i mean that's where we're headed right but what the fuck how stupid is it though
you create this misinformation gimmick whatever it is and then in a couple years say trump becomes
president again or whoever well now now the fucking trump's gang is in charge of that now i think
trump would just say fuck you think he would just do that i mean what if it wasn't trump what if it
was some other fucking democrats some other what if it was a republican a hardcore republican who was
like write down republican lines who decided he want to go he wants to go anti everything democrat
well then now you just fucked yourself because now you created this you created this fucking
mechanism that any power can control once they're in office yeah but you can also get rid of it
like i mean it's not you know are they but they don't they never have done that no they've never
gotten rid of power once you have that power true they never they never give they never give rights
back right they never give them back they take an inch by inch by inch by inch so you're right
this bureau in itself could could create a fucking a monster yeah oh yeah what the fuck is this that's
a nina jaco did you see the tiktok video she did no you did it no oh my god can you pull up the
tiktok video you're talking about can can calvin right hand clicker pull it up because when because
when you hear it let's time let's see how fast it's how long it takes them oh yeah let's see how good
he is tiktok's too hard is that reason tiktok's too hard hold on jankowitz during the president
during the presidential but as mad as you are now as mad as you are now yeah you are going to be
you're gonna be fucking speechless when you hear her tikt she did a tiktok video of her new job
she did a tiktok video over doing jobs now here's a motherfucker that you're putting in charge of a
major bureau within homeland security right now i don't think that motherfucker that you just
needs to be doing tiktok videos about like i just think that joe should have maybe watched this video
before put this bitch in charge saying this is what this is where we're fucking putting in here
like this is bad if calvin the right hand clicker can he find this that's the question can calvin
find the calvin all you gotta do is this thing called google and tighten nina jankowitz's tiktok
stupid fucking video and then hit the click button it can't be that hard i mean tiktok works on
regular browsers doesn't it yeah but we are in a fucking ac automotive shop so it could be hot as
fucking here you could be we could be on with aol 2400 bod right now i could be
i mean i thought you guys would have one k up in this bitch was one k like what like like
your upload download deal oh no we're not fucking we're slow me we're slow as fuck over here
here we go here we go oh yeah hold on before calvin before you play it
turn that out we need to add blocker yeah yeah yeah so hold on not that one yeah right there calvin
calvin the clicker clicker see hey stop stop it stop it stop it stop it stop
dany prepare oh my god this is the bitch this is the bitch that's now running a bureau within
homeland security and has the ability to listen to the concrete motherfucking podcast and say that

he sued me because he was such an actor i went on i got in front of the jury and said yeah i did it
yeah i called him that mm-hmm yeah i did under free speech he's a public figure and you know he
mj was like you know try to get into character and i think johnny deb's acting too much i think he's
coming across way too melodramatic i think she's you know and i don't know what do you think about
it i think johnny i think i don't see any way that she would win this he's the one suing her
right but she countersued him for double so he sued her for 50 and she said let me give you the
good news i'm gonna counter sue you for a hundred no here's the problem she's not collectible he is
right so here's what the jury's gonna nobody really wins right well here's what the jury's
gonna do both of you motherfuckers get zero go and just go on it's just that's what's probably gonna
happen yeah i think but i mean there's been i would think her though she's hot she is fucking hot

shit i know he's like yeah i'm doing some cocaine me and maryland manson did some cocaine yeah i gave

i'll just my guitar collection alone would blow you away i have to i got bb king i got meatloaf i
got journey i got aro smith i got lover boy i got fucking kid rock i got slash i got fucking
you know uh metallica air uh you know i talked to him via email a couple months ago and he
promised that he would do the show after he's through the lawsuit bullshit right yeah i i i uh
met him again uh three october's ago when he did a show and uh and at the hard rock it went over
and saw him uh and got a hold of his management and stuff and it was this big meet and greet they
had a line from here to wherever and they fucking praded me right in really and he sat down and
talked to me for like five or ten minutes because he'd been on the show back in the day and back
when we had 98 rock livestock he did a couple of them for us um and uh he was fucking he didn't
have his makeup on or nothing he was just regular he puts on a hell of a show too he's a great smart
fucking guy very smart very listen to his his columbine interviews when columbine happened and
they're asking him like what would you say to those kids if they were here right now he's like
i wouldn't say a fucking thing to him i would listen to what they had to say that's what no one
did he's kind of been really painted into a fucked up corner he really has you know because
realistically i don't give a fuck what he sings about i don't give a fuck what it's his right
to i mean right i mean like you know he they a lot of people get on him because of his you know
the dope show and like a lot of his songs are controversial and what who can that's art that's
art yeah well i mean it's i don't think he never really like properly got canceled or
had his career hurt as bad as it has been with the evan rachel wood thing saying that she
she sexually abused him and enslaved her and groomed her but you're a fucking 18 years old
and you're getting into bed with this guy i mean don't you sort of have some sort of responsibility
and there's a deal it's open season on white men yeah it is Bill Cosby's free
i mean it's oh hold on jesse smollett didn't do shit they didn't fucking really i mean what
what did he get right it's how about that dude who just fucking tackled Dave chappelle and
didn't even get charged with anything it's open season on white guys that's weird it's true that's
i mean you know bryan's on the on the verge of probably getting cancelled for for all of that
but that's not any and and you can't i mean look at the company what maryland manson did uh was
wrong but it wasn't to the level of what cosby did no it wasn't to the level of what fucking
chris brown did how many times did they let chris brown out for beating a fuck out of people right
i mean you know i this whole rock stuff look at ron jeremy ron jeremy's gonna be in the
prison for the rest of his life is he already in there oh yeah he's in there oh my god you know
what i need a sip look at i need i need you to help me because i have a pot i have a youtube video
of when he was in my show in like 09 with denis haw from the bunny ranch admitting to how he gets
how he goes to these night we're like hey uh uh ron jeremy how do you go like in la how do you
get pussy and he goes well i'll tell you how you do it i go down to the comedy club and i get a
couple chicks i tell him who i am i take him to the bathroom and fuck him what and it's exactly what
they're trying him on and i have the the podcast no i mean i have the video way yeah i need to you
need to show me how to do this buddy i wonder what it was like for that motherfucker back in his
heyday when he was like right in the middle of it when you're a porn star it can't be that i mean
i wonder if it would be like porn stars aren't near as cool as rock stars that's true that's who
gets the pussy that's true i mean i've seen it firsthand i mean i have fucking seen it firsthand
you know back in the 98 rock days when we had livestock and we would you know all be back in
the in the in the back a little backstage area and i had a bus and they had a bus and we all and
motley crew was there and kid rock was there and creed was there and you know three doors down and
you just you just you see how the groupie world works and it literally they just they just fuck
all day this just literally fuck and get high all day that's such a fucking incredible life oh
can you a mat like that what what is uh this here on goes they they they get up at noon
everything's catered for them this is if they're on the bus everything's catered for them they get
high they do their coke they do whatever the fuck they need to do nobody everybody leaves them alone
and then they have you know like you know five or six calvins that are out scouring the campgrounds
and stuff for just nothing but straight hot bitches and they go up to this hot bitch and say hey you
want to go hang out with motley crew and they're like fuck yeah sorry your boyfriend can't come
along next thing no they're on the bus and they're literally getting fucking railed by all the boys
just straight getting fucking railed and then the then the band tells them hey after the show come
back you know come back over we'll do some fucking some coke and fuck again and they load their bus
up and go over to orlando and do a show over there and repeat god repeat rents repeat god damn man
you know what i think about i think about a lot like i know a lot of people who are young who are
like like tfue for example who just came and crossed all this fucking money and famous but he's not
a but he can't rock star can he oh fuck yeah he can fucking rock really oh fuck i mean i'm girls
still rock star i mean look he doesn't walk out in the public it's not like he's like walking around
and gets like mobbed he's not like that kind of a figure but it's more like social media just
right so many fucking horny bitches in his dms all day every fucking day it's just it's just
fucking shooting fish in a barrel right and he does anything he fucking kids got the world
of his fingertips but when i think about people his age when you get that kind of fucking money
and fame of popularity and and just when you can get anything you fucking want i think it
fucks with you at that young of an age it does it does if it i'm fucked up and i had it on such a
micro level than they do you know i had it on a local somewhat of a global level when i was with
howard but it it it makes you so callous in life about what turns you on now right like what you
know like honest to god if i if if there was two hot girls two super hot chicks right now
on that couch eat each other's pussy going crazy probably you and calvin would be like holy
shit you know and i'm not trying to call you guys you know like inexperienced nerds or nothing
but i mean you haven't seen a lot of that probably and they were just going crazy they were dildoing
and fucking going crazy that was a tuesday for me that's so and so it would have to be so much
elevated for me to be you know because i've seen so much because i've lived
you know a bunch of different lives you know i was you know the host of a of a of a really
popular global radio show that brought a bunch of money and a bunch of fame and a bunch of bitches
i've been friends with you know a lot of really really high-profile people so i lived that fringe
of a life then i've been then i've had on my show huge you know from oj simpson to motley crew to
bill cosby you know i've had those people that in some instances were in studio and we became
friendly and i hung out with him privately so i've kind of been you know in that world on a
different a couple different one i've lived a little bit of it but i've also seen a lot of it
as well or been the guest of it and it's you know god but it's changed i mean it's like you can't
run bitches the way you used to run bitches what do you mean well i mean back in the day they
didn't have phones they didn't have you know if you get a girl now if you're a rock star now and
you find you're fucking a girl backstage and she snaps a picture or something like that i mean
you're fucked right you're fucked you know back in the day you can just be right and you don't
worry about her posting hey i just left you know fucking such as you know tfuz you know hotel room
here's a picture of his car as she's leaving like i mean now i mean you kind of i don't even know
how those guys do it now you have to probably have them sign nda's the minute they walk in oh yeah
right i've heard stories about that i've heard stories about like like nba player like fucking
nba player life behind closed doors how they had those parties where all the girls have to sign
nda's i knew a couple girls that used to fuck athletes back about five years ago and they had
to sign an nda and put their cell phone in there like in the like those little yoder bags yeah
comedy shows yes and in that or in the refrigerator or something like that and sign an nda with a
picture of their driver's license before they would they could get into doing what they were
going to do which is fuck right right right so yeah i think there's no possible in hell lebron
james has been faithful to his wife oh no i used to hang out with a guy uh that played for the
lakers his name was tony smith uh and he was there from like 90 he was from marquette and he was um
uh a second string guard and when i met him in milwaukee when i was in milwaukee
and then i came to tampa and he was still playing for the lakers i think he played the league like
eight or nine years and um he when he would come and play like when the lakers play in this area
usually the mba routes him for like they'll play at lana uh orlando the heat charlotte they kind of
route him that way you know so randy fund was the coach and i took side took three or four
days off the power pickets vacation because tony smith called me and said hey why don't you meet me
in orlando have a friend drive you over to orlando and then and this is what this is like 1993 and
i got pictures of me and james worthy and flotty divock and and all these guys anthony peeler and
so i kind of got a three-day look at the mba life and so i got driven over to orlando i
tony had a suite uh like a two adjoining like not a suite but a room that adjoined on to another
room so i had my own bedroom so he got in he checked in the hotel room they got in like around
you know noon they had shoot around the the team had a shoot around like at three or something
and then they played the and so they went back and i got to go to go to all this and then they had
to game like at seven so they went back to the hotel room and a little catered deal and they all
ate and took a nap and shit and then they went and played the game and so i had players taken
some but well then the fun begins because they spent the night in orlando because the next
game was in miami the next day so they just stayed in orlando well they all everyone every player
has a black book at that point of every girl in town that they have either fucked or hooked up with
and they call them all to the lobby and then they just go down to the lobby and pick who they want
they fuck them you know they go crazy well tony was already working on the girls in miami a day
before so orlando orlando goes so we get on the team plane i i get to fly with them like
they it was that's well there's only like 15 guys on the on the team and with super you know there's
probably 30 total people that travel so they got a they had a chartered like they chartered like a
they didn't have their own lakers playing back then they would just charter like a delta deal but
you know they had tony so your the players could bring friends and stuff as long as you were cool
so they flew into miami and they just did the same thing had a whole list of chicks
fuck them and then tony was working on the atlanta girls and the charlotte girls and that's that's
how it goes every night there'd be two or three different girls and the game was just something
they had to get they had to you know they had to play the game but that what the game was fucking
that's fucking crazy that the game was fun and every one of them did it that is every one of
them fucking crazy it's all it all just boils down to fucking fame and money everything boils down to
fame and money that's what it's all about it's fucking bananas man and now you can get fame and
money so much differently than you used to let's refer back to tfue back in the day to a guy that
played video games would you ever be able to attain the level of and i'm saying this and like i
have so much respect for this dude oh yeah like i got nothing but love for this motherfucker this
guy's the man right but it's so cool now that fame and money used to just be either you inherited it
your family had it uh you were an athlete you were a rock star uh an entrepreneur a highly educated
businessman that invented something like there was only a you know a little bit of a pie on how to get
but now you know with with the advent of what you're doing and what tfue does and gaming and
tick talking and shit fame and money is can can be for the average person it used to be you had
to be a mega star that was indoctrined into fame or money your parents you were a Rockefeller you
you know the this or that yeah not anymore it's the wild west it really is but there's so much
shit out there that you have to be able to rise above the top in order to get noticed
and you got a great foothold and a great start on it you know the funny thing about you might be
more famous have more money than me someday probably already do i don't have two kids highly
dealt that fuck anyways the thing about tfue it's just so fascinating is that like people jump on
the bandwagon with things right like i jumped i wasn't doing podcasts before i started this podcast
like two and a half three years ago maybe and i did it because it was a it was already a thing that
was starting to like gain momentum like maybe i should try doing this you know i could my whole
thing my whole view on this podcast is like like i came from the documentary world so this is like
i can do a documentary a week but there's no b-roll there's no music cut into it so that's
that's how i think about this but i did kind of jump on a bandwagon turner tfue he was playing
fucking video games when it was not cool when there was no money right when his brother was
fucking getting rich making all these prank videos right right next door living in the
fucking room next to him and tfue wouldn't go participate in all these videos and try to ride
his brother's coattails he was in his room by himself playing fucking video games not getting
any pussy right and then all of a sudden juke squad dr killin exactly and then in one month he
fucking spot skyrocketed a million times fucking higher than his brother yeah like there's something
to say about sticking to something even when it's not going good and no one else is doing well your
prime example of that as well i mean you don't have 500 000 subscribers because you quit you don't
have 500 000 subscribers because you don't have any talent you don't have 500 000 subscribers
because you don't have interesting people i mean i got people in radio that have been in radio a
long time that are our big time fans of your podcast because it's good shit i mean off the
top of my head i can tell you you know three or four of the things i mean the counterfeiter guy
the mac the mac cox guy the fbi guy that you know the guy that found the fucking wittekers and in uh
i mean you got you got you know you got some great shit going don't stop i mean what what happens
when you hit a million subscribers who knows who knows who knows man i just keep going that you
do documentaries yeah that's how i started i started doing documentary one have you ever
seen deckhands the documentary i did on the deer beach no holy fuck you gotta watch it's the best
thing i've ever done on youtube for sure but can i off the air when we get done show you my little
seven minute sizzle i would love to watch it of because i'm i'm in kind of a little bit of a limbo
where i'm making a change with the people that i'm working with and you know maybe that might be
something you'd be interested in yeah i would love i would love to see it i would love it's only seven
my sizzle is like seven twenty two which is a little long for a sizzle but you know i'd love
for you to watch it have you ever seen the commercial i did with hogan and the wrecking ball
yes was that you i made that that was that was me and my friend luke literally it was to to promote
this fucking hosting company right guys came to me and they're like hey we got we're uh you did that
hogan yeah hogan came to me because i was live i was working at that shopping center on clorida
beach where a brown boxer right and i worked out every day with fucking hogan and he came to me
and i've done commercials with him in the past this was after the sex tape yeah i should ask you
about what he says about it he i don't think he's ever we've ever really talked about it to be honest
right but i always try to lightly around that subject right but he's like because i did a
bunch of commercials for hogan's beach that's how i that's how i really met him and started
working with him closely and i was doing tons of commercials with him and then he kind of like
trusted me and he's like hey i got these entrepreneurs are trying to get me to promote
their business it's a hosting company they want to call it hostomania like i want you to do the
commercial for it brother i'm like okay like he's like come up with an idea and that was right after
the my lee syris my wrecking ball i'm like we're gonna put you in a but it wasn't it wasn't a thong
or was he naked he was he was in a thong right but i'm like i'm like we want to put you on a
wrecking ball and it'll go viral i'm fucking put it on tmd didn't go fucking viral went super
fucking viral it fucking worked great it was it blew the you did that i did that yep little
motherfucking dany jones in the back of a god damn use carlon what the fuck dany jones yep yep i did
that where do you live what where do you live i live i live right down the street in seminal i'll
live right you know writing to inshores's yeah yeah like right there cool like wherever some
seminal writing to inshores and uh anyways that like that led me into doing like all his fucking
commercials for every little brand that he would work with i would do the commercials he'd be his
commercial guy yeah basically his commercial fucking idea guy or filmer guy whatever you want
to call it my my video my doc is it could be huge i mean i mean you you you didn't know that what i

a nozark what are you into i was a breaking bad i watched breaking breaking bad game of thrones
after those two i gave ozark a shot i watched a couple episodes i'm like they're trying to
fucking hard like it's not it's too close into the realm of breaking bad for me yeah breaking
bad was too fucking good and it kind of ruined ozark's for me everybody loves ozarks ozarks
tries to take the manufacturing aspect out of what they're talking about whereas they're just
laundering money whereas i think that's what was super cool about breaking bad is they showed you
the production of it you know how walter perfected the fucking like the actual manufacturing of it
yeah you know the the laundering and money part of it i guess this may be the smart persons part
of it i want to see the fucking street level part of it yeah the fuck i mean just like the
fucking his story like just mr whatever mr chips to go into fucking scarface and he was a pimp
he was a fucking walter white was a pimp he was fucking badass dude oh man everything about that
show is so fucking good oh yeah billy corbin on here oh billy's a friend of mine is he really
yes he's funny i had him on with screwball we promoted screwball and and uh did you see the
latest cocaine cowboys i did okay i loved it didn't you really fucking good with willy falcone
yeah all that shit i didn't know about i had a my buddy bb i probably shouldn't say that as now we
kept him anonymous i had him on here but he worked baby it's just bb yeah bb he was in prison with
willy falcone and he actually worked with him in miami and he told me he used to tell me all these
fucking stories like we're the he's like you gotta find out about this guy willy falcone he's been
telling me forever i'm like who the fuck is willy falcone he's like trust me he was way bigger than
fucking grizzel de blanca or yeah yeah willy and then they fucking knew cocaine cowboys
documentary comes out all about willy i was like holy and your boy was telling you about
even telling you about it for years yeah but yeah man the whole coke i had uh george valdez on here

right he was like the main accountant who like started the uh the cartel who's been your favorite
guest over all the years my favorite guests yeah over all the years fuck man i don't know
honestly i had probably more fun talking to brett phillips on on here than than most people i feel
like we had a really good we had a really good rapport had a really good conversation she's a
kid who plays for the rays yeah we talked about fucking like crypto and nfts and he went to seminal
high school the same high school i went to is he still play for the rays yeah he still plays for
the rays local outfielder yeah from from uh from seminal good he he fucking like his story is so
crazy because he um he was like kind of like a nobody on the team you know what i mean like he
barely like he went from got traded from the royals to the rays which was his hometown
and he wasn't he was just like an outfielder he never really had any big highlights but he ended
up breaking babe ruth's record for more grand slams in the shortest amount of time than anybody in
history really yeah and then and then when the rays were in the world series what was it two years
ago yeah yeah um it was like they were getting blown out for the whole series and it was game four i
think it was and then they bring him in they bring him in it was like they're the games over
right they lost the fucking game but the bases were loaded and they bring in phillip bring him in
bottom of the ninth he's like no pressure like whatever he's like i just said a little prayer to
jesus and i walked up on that i fucking just swung for the fences and he fucking hit a grand slam
and they won the game and he's like fucking johnny rock star he said he almost had a heart attack
after he said his his resting heart rate was like 200 right after he was all over the news
anyways that was one of my favorite conversations i've ever had him mark laida mark ladies the guy
who interviewed the people of the kentucky people or the people in odd tennessee what was it odd
odd his name of the town odd west virginia odd west virginia the metzkers yes yes i mean i like
because of that i watched the metzkers that's their name isn't it the whitikers the whitikers
yeah the whitikers in odd west virginia the one guy just barks yeah if you have you watched any of it
oh yeah that's freaky and it's all in breeding and and it's all from fucking each other they're
they're dead family members are just buried in the front yard i know just when we think we got it bad
bad just go to the fucking metzker whitikers where the fuck they are god i watched a little bit of
that that's how i got on that rabbit hole with ana yeah dude yeah man that i liked cox though i
thought cox you know in small doses i think you go to the max cox car too much though i do go to
it i'm too much yeah he's kind of like my go to yeah like him but you know tell me gotta a couple
we're gonna give him some georgia boots with an insert it'll be five four and we'll be great
he's got those now he definitely has those same fucking boots you got now his jeans keep getting
tighter and his shirts keep getting tighter every time he comes in i'll tell you though he had a
fucking racket though didn't he he had a fucking rack yeah i don't know who had a better racket him
or the counterfeiting guy honestly the guy who i had on two weeks ago probably puts them both
to shame the guy i had on two weeks ago it was like the biggest cyber security fraudster in the
history of the country you're kidding me yeah no he was filing 200 tax returns a day going to
fucking atms and cashing the irs checks he would spend one full day filing at filing 200 tax returns
spend the following three fucking days going to atms across the country cashing the irs checks
filling up his jansport backpack with like $150,000 a day local guy uh no he was based out of uh
georgia did he come down coming to the show he flew down and did it yeah really one of the most
insane frauds how much times did he do he ended up only doing i think it was less than 10 years
i think it was like seven or eight years really yeah less less time than matt he made way more
fucking money than matt did now do any of these guys and this is just your opinion this is me asking
you questions i'm sorry that's okay but like do any of these do you think any of these guys kept it
any of it like when you got actually actually and this is just your opinion you just reminded me
you just reminded me of probably one of my top favorite podcasts i'm gonna need another hit of
assaults yeah this guy fucking roger reeves he was uh he was a fucking he was a pilot who learned
to fly because he wanted to fly for missionaries he was the number one drug smuggler i just watched
it yep i just started watching it that's his book right behind you the smuggler on the on the middle
shelf yeah he was probably one of my favorite fucking podcasts of all time because he's just
like this old guy with the southern draw talks like this you know he just has a beautiful voice
to listen to and fucking almost evangelical right he was 18 years old flying his fucking little plane
that he owned from california to mexico once a week making a million dollars a day
dealing with these fucking columbians this guy could kill you he got shot down five fucking times
and lived got shot down fucking machine gunned across his leg got his fucking balls shot they shot
his testicles why would they shoot him because i don't remember exactly why he took off from a
fucking airport he was running from the columbian police that's what he was doing right he met he
did a train a deal he was transporting coke from the club for the columbians back to california
the columbian police were shooting trying to shoot him down and he they actually did shoot him down
he had to run through the jungle for fucking three weeks and he fucking almost died made it
crazy fucking story i like to see a documentary on him why don't you do a documentary on him
they did it locked up abroad about him actually oh okay he was in all they ended up locking him
in australia for eight years he escaped prison like four or five times bro this guy's a fucking
this guy's a fucking killer and he is like the most docile southern like a gentleman
right now he lives in uh he lives in santa barbara with his wife yeah but he'll come to your show
man he is fucking amazing this guy this is one of the most fascinating characters ever now did he
save any of it you think in my opinion just your opinion i think he's invested in real estate and
i think he's still uh he's got how about cox he's got no cox no this guide yes this guy counterfeit
willy counterfeit willy no i was watching these guys some of these guys aren't bright this fucking
guy is old school columbia dealing with the fucking with pablo directly right he's he fucking he
could call up georgio choa right now right and and i think he he literally has a fuckload of money
still invested right i think i don't know because on that level you know there's not a lot of
documentation you know when you're the irs guy i mean they're filling out the tax forms you know
there's obviously documentation and when you're cox and you've stole 45 identities and this this
and when you're counterfeit willy yeah but you know there's a paper trail but when you're just
got bag loads of money like you know they don't they don't fucking know where one of the what to
do with this fucking money he had he was buying fucking family members and friends fucking mansions
on the water in california god i did not know what to do and there's a difference between guys like
him though and guys like matt cox and counterfeit guy because guys like matt and guys like counterfeit
guy they were trying to finance their lifestyle matt was trying to like finance all these fucking
whores he was dating and and these cars and all this shit and he was like he was broke like roger
he was just this young kid trying to go on these adventures he and and he didn't need the fucking
money and then the shit he went through i mean like cox and counterfeit willy they did fed time
right you know whatever they didn't have to go fucking in a broad and prison for eight years and
escape four times and get shot out and live in the jungle three weeks right right you know right
they were always in a fucking they had a hot and a cot at least always right right and and um roger
interesting thing about him too he's like keep that shit in the middle in case i need it what oh
community yeah don't fucking don't be don't be born bogey i've done some shit okay all right
right um i'm taking out her hit while you tell me to deal he's been with the fucking his wife since
like high school they're high school sweethearts and she stayed with him for his like 28 years
stent through prison he was in prison for i think close to 30 years and she stayed with him the whole
time how'd you find him he emailed me you know it was fucking i would go sometimes i go i miss
emails from people that kind that try to be guests on the show i miss we miss a lot of them
and it was like one weekend i'm like you know i need to start like really
like paying attention to like the guests i need to get some really interesting people on here and
i was going through old emails i just searched my email sometimes i type in the word interview in
the search bar and find out people who have entered me emailed me about interviews and i came
across this guy's email i missed six months ago and i fucking called him up this motherfucker was
trying to get ahold of you yes and i called him up and i was like even worse you gotta get your
ass kicked for that i know i know it's pathetic so you call him off pathetic like hey bud i call
him up and i'm like hey man i'm like i really i'm like your fucking stories first of all i thought
it was bullshit like just by like the headline of the email and like what the subject was i'm like
i'm calling thinking he's full of shit first of all and i called him like listen to him he's talking
to me for like an hour on the phone telling me a story i'm like no fucking way they told me about
his book i read a couple chapters of his book and i'm like dude i need to get you here asap
and he's like well you know me and my wife are just traveling through georgia and we're actually
in north florida right now looking to buy some real estate and he was him and his wife were looking
to buy like a house in florida and i'm like okay i'm like well can i get you down here he's like
well i don't know uh we're all really busy and my wife's got surgery next month and i don't know
if we can make it and i'm just like i need to get you here i'm like i'll do whatever you want
eventually i talked him into coming a month later and uh as soon as i dropped the podcast with him
rogan's best friend fucking uh who i was telling you about lex freedman right
hit him up and he was on his podcast like the next fucking week i mean rogan watches your
shit and then and then he was on rogan's show the week after that telling him all about roger
it's like you gotta get that rogan you gotta get roger on i'm talking about it and it was just
anyways did rogan get roger on he hasn't got him on yet no oh but uh but roger roger has
netflix knocking out he's got all these fucking production companies calling him you know it's
weird we're talking about like like old school radio business and tv business and the movie biz
show biz a majority of the criminals that i have on here they fucking after they do this show
they get companies production companies beating their fucking doors down trying to get them to do
like like like shopping deals like shopping agreements right to to shop their shows around
most of these production companies they don't fucking have shit going for them no they're
just trying to lock up as many ideas as they can i have a bookshelf i've ran into that yeah i've
ran into these production companies who really are just broke like sniffers i call them sniffing
they're sniffing around to to get you excited to then try to go sell that to somebody who can
really make a documentary right you know i'm saying right like like there's a lot there's
so much of that it is it's such a there's not a racket man it really is it's kind of a racket
be like hey you know and then and realistically they if they're gonna shoot it they have to go
and rent you know a couple guys to shoot it and then have a couple guys at it and you know it's
just it's a it's a it's just it's a fucking racket there's just not a lot of legitimate
fucking people out there and it's done the the industry's done a 180 now now the production
companies that have relationships with networks or tv networks or studios whatever it is they're
scouring podcasts and internet shows to try to find content for tv well do you know how many
podcasts not like the the dirty john series was it the dirty john series um that was it the dirty um
it started out as an la times uh podcast uh it was it was from a podcast you know and i don't
know if you know this but la times as a newspaper you know the newspaper industry is absolutely
fucking oh yeah almost as dead as my career so you know they went and they took their top journalists
and said we're going to build recording studios where your little cubicles are and we want you
guys to start instead of finding stories for the newspaper find stories that we can make into podcasts
and la times oh shit you know the cops like to fucking pull people over in our parking lot
really fucked up it's annoying so i forget i think it was called Austin the air bro it's
fucking is it is it is it running right now it's hot as calvin here you guys have had a lot of 300
pound guests so i've created a lot of heat no i'm sweating my ass off right now but i think it's
called dirty dirty john okay i forgot dirty john it's called dirty john and it and it's a two or
three part series christian slater is in it and it's in it and it's all based on true stories okay
and it's and it's all all of this started out as podcasts and so a lot of documentaries and a
lot of miniseries and a lot of these things are these production companies are gravitating to these
podcasts and you're right turning out there's a large portion of them that are legitimate that
are turning podcasts into you know video productions right you gotta you gotta write that down dirty
john and get into what was it at what forum was it on netflix so it's on netflix it's called dirty
john okay and i know you'll like it because it even says from the la times podcast like la times
now has a podcasting right vision right so and it makes sense i mean i applaud the la times here's
the newspaper industry arguably one of the top five newspapers in america sees that printed
newspaper is you know about is this it um who's this guy dirty john dirty john la times by christopher
gotfard go fard which one uh i think what is that the one we saw um we saw that we saw what's
dirty john about it's about it's about it's about the first one is about a doctor who kills people
okay and paralyzes them and he was a he was a back surgeon and he was doing back surgeries wrong
because he was high on pills and all this kind of bullshit and and all of it's true all of it's true
and then the second one comes from this guy who was a lawyer and a doctor and his wife and he
went and he had an affair uh he was a big sling and dick attorney out of la out of san diego
and he was having an affair with his secretary well his wife went bat shit crazy on him because he
left her with the two kids and then she murdered him oh my god and she was on trial and the first
time got a hung jury and then the second time they tried her but they're all based on true stories
all from an la times podcast wow and so i know you're in the podcasting world is uh and if you're
rooting for podcasting it just goes to show you that you know so here's la times who's like man
printed newspaper business is over like it's you know it's with the rubik's cube it's fucking
done right um we're going to turn our journalists those that are talented into podcasters and so
they have a whole podcasting wing which is brilliant it is brilliant i mean it's the way they like
even npr has a lot of really good podcasts too like uh the serial one i don't know if you've
serial killers or it's just called serial and they had uh they basically follow these long
like murder trials and like weird fucking stories but they make them like netflix shows but audio
like they fucking they all the editing and the sound and the music oh it's such a huge production
so riveting yeah it is it's great now where do you just now you guys do youtube your podcast
but do you guys does your is your podcast audibly distributed oh yeah oh yeah it's on youtube
and then well visibly it is visibly it's on youtube right and then the audio is published on
i or apple podcast and spotify and do you do do you aggregate that through like uh just want like
i have art 19 that i use to aggregate it through all of my you know yeah we use uh a platform called
anchor which is owned by spotify okay so i upload it basically directly to spot to this company that's
owned by spotify it's called anchor it's kind of like anchor megaphone now they'll stitch in the
they'll stitch in the commercials exactly so so there there's owned it's a company that's owned
by spotify that has like a platform to upload the audio and they actually bring us a lot of sponsors
too right directly because spotify is turned into this giant fucking agency like this giant marketing
company right especially like the additive of they're an audio platform but i think we're on i think
we're on i think my shit's on spotify i think you can do video on spotify now too you can yeah so
should i start doing that you think oh fuck yeah i'm in the process of right now transitioning all
of my audio spotify episodes to the video version i think fucking spotify is going to give youtube
a run for its money so but when you're saying you're in the process of taking all your audio spotify
and visualizing it meaning you're just going to sync up the video of it no no so i have so right
now i uploaded all the audio mp3s right to spotify right but all they have a tool on there where you
can just replace the file so i can i have mp4 video files of every podcast so i have an audio
file and a video file with the audio right like the clones of each other sure so let's replace
the audio file with the video file and it'll be the same exact audio and not lose anything anything
you're just basically putting the visual part of what was existingly there now in replace of the
audio exactly perfect and without losing any without losing any view and any view counts
any nothing like that and then and then they've they've actually just built in this cool new
feature which can run the ads like with the video so it's honestly it's just like
it's like a early version of youtube right right it's fucking cool and i think you know i don't
know i don't know what's gonna happen but now when you do your when you do your midstream
placements do you do them yourself or do you let them do do you let them do the placements the
midstream i do a lot of it myself and they also put a lot of automatic ones in there as well
okay okay so yeah so they charge they charge you different so like the sponsors that they want to
pay more money for a sponsorship can that can be read by me and i can put it of course yeah
spoken word yeah right exactly but i'm talking about you know not that yeah of course i mean i do
a ton of that but i'm talking about like when you're uploading your youtube deal and it says
and it says what a rookie move fucking what a fucking god damn my lord you're fucking
with me cheap headphones will you tell this guy's a piece of shit and then hang up on him yeah what's

thing's been run dry i mean if you hit them hard it gets it gets you right but it gets you it does
get you if you hit it right but when this thing's brand fucking new and it comes in the in the
plastic bag you can't even fucking open the plastic bag whoo whoo have you always been a wrestling
fan your whole life yeah since you're young and i'm the only i i actually wrestled a little bit
back in the day really hogan got me set up so good kind of had it so good i um what wwe would do
is because i was syndicated in all the you know when they when they just like the mba when the
wwe wwe f come to a territory they'll hit like you know they'll do monday night rawl and tampa
then they'll they'll do a house show like in orlando and then they would do like you know
friday night in miami you know so they they route they route it you know globally right you know
so the the boys don't have to travel so much so when hogan and i were hanging out hogan would
tell vince hey my best friend uh i i got trained in wrestling by a guy named tom stone in mawaki
and so i knew a little bit about wrestling i'd been trained you know i've been to wrestling school
a little bit because when i was in mawaki um this guy named tom stone would do these high
school shows and buy and get these independent guys you know like get greg the hammer valentine
for 500 to come in you know and and he'd do these he'd do these um high school shows where i was the
number one rated you know radio guy in mawaki uh did afternoon drive and i was a little bit crazy
back then and they had me i had freedoms to talk about what i wanted so tom stone said well i'm
getting two or three hundred people to come to these wrestling shows at high schools but if i had
you on the card uh as the local radio personality and i would let you win i let you smash the
fuck out of everybody i'd pack it so i'd be like well hell he goes well six months you and you got
to come down and get trying to do bump hit the ropes learn the fucking lingo learn the philosophy
you know just learn various things so i then would be like you know uh hot one oh two wlum
bob the love sponge don't forget this weekend this friday night at walk ashore high school
i'm the main event i'm taking on the texas hangman that's right and so then i'd have the texas
hangman calling and be like let me tell you something bubba you fat ass i'm gonna take
your pillar to post you short armed little son of a bitch you don't have any experience you're fat
you're stupid and i'd be like i'm gonna and we you know so we would you know all that for like
two weeks and then the high school all the kids would get involved and the high school football
team would sell tickets as a fundraiser and we would fucking pack the place out two or three
thousand of course i'd go in there beat the fuck out of the guy guy would do some juice get some
fucking hard way juice and i'd be the fucking man so i had some wrestling experience when i came
to tampa then i got friends with hogan and hogan tells vent's hey my guy my best friend
you know he knows enough enough about wrestling that he could be the opening matches at the cities
that he's heard in so i was heard in jacksonville i was heard in orando i was heard in miami i was
heard in fort mires i was heard in tampa so when the wwe would come into town i would be the opening
match the dark match that wasn't on tv so you know they have two or three matches before tv starts
well i would be one of the opening matches but what wwe got from that was three four weeks of me
on the radio every night being like that's right just saturday night i'll be at the sundome taken
on the brooklyn brawler you know and so they would get all of that added value and then i would
wait i'd just beat the shit out of the guy that's fucking amazing the best story of all the best
story of all is if you're a wrestling fan is i was in the sundome here in tampa which is the
what's called the yingling center now you know where usf is
where they play basketball no yingling yingling it's called the yingling you know yingling yingling
beer oh oh yeah yeah yeah gotcha used to be called the sundome it had it fits about eight or nine
thousand and it's where usf plays basketball you know so it was i was the wwe wwe f was there
that night and uh hogan for some reason wasn't there i forget i don't know if he had defected yet
or or what but but vent was still using me on the cities on my cities that i was heard as opening
matches and they pay me 500 and they put me over i mean i would win so i go there that night and the
boys in the locker rooms kind of always resented me because i wasn't one of you know i was kind of
a guy who got fast tracked into kind of a cool position right you know so you know here's some
guys that have been around for 10 years doing jobs and you know here i am fucking johnny hot shot
roll in with my louis futon luggage and and my fucking hair you know hair fucking slick and
and and be able to beat these guys that were regular wrestlers so i was supposed to go do you
remember the mean street posse they were shane mcman's uh best friends or something like that
well i was supposed to wrestle them as the opening match so pat paterson and now in wrestling they
have an agent and him and jerry briscoe were the two agents that night and they kind of run the locker
room and they tell who's going to win and whatever well undertaker mark calloway lived in tamp at
the time and it was a house show usually calloway didn't do house shows he only did big shows but
since it was a home a home show he did a favor for vent since so the undertaker was the big guy
of the card now if anybody knows anything about wrestling mark the undertaker ran the dressing
room he absolutely was the boss of the boys if like he's at all disputes he was even when hogan
was there hogan had his own dressing room after hogan left and then came back and calloway had
already established himself that he ran the dressing room he ran it like he fucking ran the show
so we're in the back and paterson doesn't know that i'm as popular and in tampa as i am he thinks
i'm just some local fucking radio guy this is some bullshit gimmick so we're in there and paterson's
like okay here's what's gonna happen baba briscoe's gonna feed you're gonna jerry's gonna come in get
to outside distraction mean street posse he's gonna come in hit you over the head with a
fucking chair you're gonna get dazed you're gonna try to make a comeback they're gonna scoop slam
you're really into a schoolboy one two three we're gone and i go okay i mean i'm losing at that
point okay but i'm i'm i'm like i'm just happy to be part of the fucking deal i'm in a wwe ring
in my own hometown in front of 10 000 people bubble the love sponge from 98 rock like it's
it's good promotion for me whether i win or lose who gives a fuck right so that's the way it is
calloway goes uh uh no and i was like you know i was always really respectful to mark like i was
you know uh like super cool to him and he and he lived in tampa so mark knew how over how popular
i was in tampa right and so calloway goes hey paterson let me ask you a question so we're gonna
go ahead and bury and when you get beat that fast it's called you're burying a guy okay like you're
burying right he goes so pat let me just see if i get this straight we're gonna bury a guy that spent
three weeks on promoting this show that's probably put two or three thousand extra asses in the seat
tonight and we're gonna bury him in in front of his own hometown when this is just a house show
it's not on tv we're not making any of our wrestlers look bad because nobody's gonna see it except for
the 7400 people here and we're gonna bury this guy in front of his own hometown when he's busted his
ass pat paterson without missing a beat goes you know what that uh bubba you're gonna go off the
second rope after you give him a double clothesline jerry you're gonna try to kick bubba bubba's gonna
shoot you off into a schoolboy watch for the double boot bubba you're going over and i turned
to calloway and he goes it's business man it's business it's about doing business and that's
what makes the most big boy the mean street posse were so mad they went from giving me a double
clothesline and beating me to me going off the second and smashing them and that's my that's my
fucking wrestling story that's fucking incredible all because the undertaker said no that we're not
burying a guy in his own home fucking town who's busted his ass for us we're not doing that that's
now if it had been on tv and it would been you know where people could see that it's a regular
job or off the fucking streets is now beating an accomplished wwe guy that's different but it was a
house show and i was the opening match right you know so that's that's that's i knew all that promoting
and everything like that oh yeah for three weeks and you're like oh you know and i had to mean
street posse call me up be like you know you're fat ass you know it's gonna take two of us just
to match your fat ass and you know and all that i'll be back and forth yeah they got probably
30 000 dollars of free promotion you know from me that you can't even put a value on outside of
their commercials dude i mean fucking wrestling fans have such a bad rap they have such a stigma
like i used to think that wrestling fans were such fucking losers before and then i went to
fucking wrestlemania i went to my first wrestling event ever it was the new new orleans one maybe
four years ago and they are the coolest fucking fanatics i think they're way cooler than fucking
football nba fans any sport fraternity they're like they're a fraternity they really are and when
you go there they don't fucking fuck with you they're like hey bro what's going on who's your guy
hey who's your guy wow man fuck that's my guy too yeah they want to be your boy they're all
like a fucking community of people that have each other's back unlike sports fans where it's like
more political like fuck you you know i could get you for a guest he's a very good friend of mine
matt riddle matt riddle matt riddle is the current uh co-champion with uh randy orton
oh no shit and he lives in olcato he lives in orlando now okay he's called you know he's the dude
he kicks off his flip flops he used he was a former mma guy uh his name's matt riddle maybe
