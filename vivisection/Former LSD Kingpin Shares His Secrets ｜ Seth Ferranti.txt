Hello world. Today my guest is Seth Ferranti. Seth spent 21 years in federal prison after
being convicted as an LSD kingpin. He initially faked his suicide to evade law enforcement
and he ended up on the US Marshall's top 15 most wanted list before he was eventually
arrested. Being a first time nonviolent drug offender, the severity of his sentence garnished
national attention and was covered extensively by The Washington Post, The Rolling Stone,
Vice, and many other big publications. Hope that intro wets your whistle folks. Without
further ado, please welcome Seth Ferranti.
Alright, boom. Seth Ferranti. Welcome to the show. So the short synopsis of your story
is you were a teenage LSD kingpin, right? Yeah, I mean basically more or less.
So what, you could probably tell it better than I do. So people who aren't familiar with
you, why don't you just give me a quick background.
I mean basically like around 13 I started getting into drugs, I started getting into
counterculture, you know mostly psychedelics and weed. And you know like most people when
you start using you know you look for you know especially when you're young like you're
looking for a way to pay for it so you know I was the type of person you know all my friends
wanted weed, all my friends wanted LSD so you know I was kind of the bold, adventurous
one so I would find the connects, I would find the people to go to and I would go and
buy it you know at first just get free drugs you know but eventually after doing that for
a couple years you know by the time I'm 15 or 16 I was like you know maybe I can make
money you know doing this so you know I got better contacts. I started following the Grateful
Dead you know like the late 80s. What year was this? Oh late 80s. Yeah late 80s you know
like around 87, 88 you know when I was 16, 17 years old like you know about a junior
in high school started following the Grateful Dead, got a LSD connect, got some weed connects
like actually down here at Fort Myers I got a weed connect out of Fort Myers I got a weed
connect in Dallas I got a weed connect in Kentucky plus I was getting stuff out of California
like Northern California Immo Triangle through some homeboys in San Francisco and yeah first
it was just high school you know I went to a big high school 4,000 people you know we
had like a sister high school like 4,000 people so I was kind of doing hand to hand you know
retail sales but then as all those kids this is in Northern Virginia as all those kids
went off to college you know they went to college and they would call me they'd be like
hey can you bring stuff up and then instead of just one you know friend it was like they
had 25 friends you know so then it just like you know about my 89 you know just my network
just started expanding you know and really I only had I only had like a nine month run
where I would say like I was a real big drug dealer you know and not even big in the big
scheme of things I mean I wasn't like Pablo Escobar but you know for a teenager I mean
I was 19 I was probably making like 25 30 grand a month and we're talking like 1989 yeah that's
big money you know so you know and not like I was getting a lot but I was getting like
10,000 hits of acid a month you know 100 sheets and I would probably go through I don't know
like a hundred pounds this brick weed though back then it's brick weed yeah so I mean it's
totally different game than now but I would get like a hundred pounds of brick weed you
know might last me two or three months in the fall you could get good weed like from
Northern California like what they would call what they would call outdoor now you know but
back then like we called it kind bud because compared to the brick weed it was like kind
so I would get that at Kentucky Southern Kentucky and Northern California but you could only
get that in the fall because you know that it was like little small farmers they'd grow
like 25 30 pounds so by December all that stuff would be gone so it was weed the best
drug to make money off of was could you make the most profit off of weed or why did you
choose weed okay listen if you aren't already gambling and betting on sports you need to

know I always tell people I never consider myself a criminal you know I considered myself
an outlaw because I broke laws that I thought were wrong so I mean I sold weed because I
mean to me weed and psychedelics are the righteous drugs you know so I never fuck with
like cocaine heroin even like I never did drugs like that I was never interested you
know cocaine heroin meth you know because those you know people are always Jones in
it's like a bad drug you know addicts people steal stuff so I was never into that you know
I was into what I consider the righteous drugs and just because you so you were mainly into
trafficking weed because that's what the drug that you were into personally yeah and and
also because I mean I like believed in it I didn't think it should be illegal you know
I was like I was like why it's a fucking plant man it fucking grows you know I'm saying it's
been around yeah it's been around forever so so it's cocaine though right not in the
form that you buy Dan I mean cocaine before you pour the gasoline on it yeah yeah but
um but definitely weed uh I mean I would make a lot of money back then I mean I can make
like a thousand dollars a pound basically you know I would get brick pot out of like
Dallas Texas I would get it for like three four hundred a pound and I could take it up
to the east coast and I could sell it for like you know thirteen fourteen fifteen hundred
a pound you know easy you know back then I'd say ounces were probably going like you'd
pay maybe fifty sixty a quarter and ounce of that brick pot would go for like one fifty
one sixty wow and how old were you and you eventually got busted I was I was twenty twenty
when I got only twenty years old when you got busted and how long did you do in prison
I did twenty five years well I got since it's twenty five years I did twenty one years fuck
yeah so I went in you know I went in in nineteen ninety three and I got out in two thousand
fifteen but um you know I was a fugitive for two years too so you know I got I caught
my case summer nineteen ninety one got indicted and I didn't I didn't like what I was looking
at you know they were they were talking about you know go to trial you're facing twenty
to life you know they you know and and that was like kind of the beginning of the war
on drugs nineteen ninety one and I was actually in the first wave of kind of the psychedelics
and weed guys you know goes when they made those laws in nineteen eighty eight it was
all for the you know the african-american guys in the inner city right right they were
cracking all those dudes in the head giving them like twenty thirty years for like five
little stuff yeah five grams of crack that's why they made those laws but then when they
got some criticism after they've been doing that for about three years they started getting
criticized and especially I'm in northern Virginia so we're right outside of DC so that's you
know it's kind of like you know all the politics and stuff so uh I almost felt like when my
case happened it was it was like you know they were like look we bust white drug dealers
too I was in that first wave of like weed and psychedelic dudes you know when they came
out to the suburbs you know and they just started they just started hammering us but
um yeah they were trying like I was looking at twenty to life you know they wanted like
back in the feds too because if you know anything about the feds the feds got like a like a ninety
nine percent conviction rate right so yeah most people on the feds like plead guilty
but even you know more people on the feds like cooperate most people cooperate right that's
the only way to get your sentence down basically you know so they were pressing me to cooperate
but you know I was like looking at the situation you know I didn't want to put somebody else
in a fucked up situation like I was in I didn't want to do twenty to life and I had a little
bit of money you know I didn't have a lot of money but I had a little bit of money you
know I mean I was uh you know like I said I was making you know sometimes twenty twenty
five thirty thousand a month so I had a little bit of money put away so you know I basically
I took off I was like man fuck these guys you know what I'm saying and I took off and
I was a fugitive for two years so I didn't get caught in sentence until uh nineteen ninety
three wow so you were on the run for two years you said yeah what was it like when you first
found out that you were in trouble or you had the feds on your that you were on the
feds radar oh I mean it was a shock I mean because I mean basically I was I was a you
know I grew up in the suburbs man so I was basically a white middle class kid you know
military brat so um I just didn't think you know I didn't think that I could face that
type of time especially for what I was doing you know considering I was nonviolent and and
like I already said I I didn't fuck with like what I consider the bad drugs you know I wasn't
a violent person you know so I was like really surprised I was like how the fuck could I be
facing twenty years for like weed and LSD and really not not even a lot you know in
the big scheme of things I mean I mean there's dudes bringing like tons of marijuana into
this country right you know I mean and and like I knew the LSD scene in the the Grateful
Dead I mean the chemists I mean they make like hundreds of grams of LSD like each Grateful
Dead show they would fly 25 grams of LSD into each show you know and I was getting like
I was getting like one you know one gram you know basically a month one one gram is like
a hundred sheets is like ten ten thousand hits wow so I was getting like a gram a month
you know and each Grateful Dead show they were flying in 25 grams so I was like you know
yeah in high school you know in you know a freshman a sophomore in college yeah I was
a big drug dealer you know because you know I had the money I had the drugs so you were
the guy yeah I mean we're all kids yeah but you know the big scheme of things so um yeah
I was fucked up man when that shit happened I was like I couldn't believe it you know it
was kind of like I mean it was really a big shock to me and it was also even more to me
it was like a it was like a betrayal to me you know because I grew up you know I was American
you know I was like man this is my country you know I believe all the bullshit land of
the free home of the brave you know capitalism you can do anything you wanted and then like
they're gonna come and hammer me and I'm like damn I'm like fucking you know not I didn't
go to war or nothing you know free anymore is it yeah I mean I didn't not like I went
to war and fought for the country you know but whatever if they called me I would have
you know just you know that was my time you know they didn't have that then so whatever
you know but I was like a red blooded American dude and they you know I felt I was like damn
my own fucking country is doing this shit to me you know for some yeah for some fucking
weed and LSD for some shit they should be legal so that's really that's really how I felt
that's like was really my motivation you know now I can say now you know whatever 30 years
later I mean I feel justified in my actions but you know maybe I was a man ahead of my
time or whatever but I mean that was like my whole thing you know yeah I'm not saying
I didn't I like make money I mean everybody likes money who doesn't like money you know
I'm saying money makes life easy so I like money you know I like being the rock star
you know I like getting that recognition you know being the man when I came and I liked
all that you know but I have like an underline my underline thing was this shit should be
legal I mean all my friends smoke weed you know not all my friends at LSD but a lot
did LSD I was like you know you party man you fucking do shit that's what you do especially
you know whatever you want to say white America whatever America college America I mean that's
what people do you know and I saw myself as like a facilitator of that whole scene now
the whole thing started was when there was like watching the little vice clip there was
like some kid who was running through the woods naked on LSD and he shot he grabbed the cops
gun and shot him in the arm or something yeah that was like the the cataclysm of everything
yeah so there was this you know they got this area in Fairfax County called Clifton and it's
like all like big million dollar houses and you know this is like back then it was million
dollar houses so we're talking you know like eighty nine ninety and they're all like on
five or six acres and you know sometimes like every time like any any place in the suburbs
you know when people's parents go out of town people throw parties you know so they used
to throw some big parties out there because they had a lot of land you know sometimes they would
like bring they would bring like stages out for bands they would like skateboard ramps they
would like literally move skateboard ramps in you know and have skate shows and all types of stuff so
they were having this big party out there and you know eventually like all parties you know
that the cops get called you know so the cops got called and there was this one kid I never met
the kid I don't know who he is but you know 15 year old kid I mean his name was all on my
paperwork I can't remember though but like a little 15 year old kid he was tripping on acid
he was like basically the cops came and like he freaked out and he was running through the
woods naked and you know this cop chased him down you know tackled him or whatever grabbed him and
I guess whatever the kid freaked out grabbed the cops gun and you know he shot him but it was like
basically like he shot him in the arm man so I mean you know I mean it could have been I'm not
downplaying anything I mean it could have been more serious I mean he shot him but I mean he shot
him in the arm you know so basically like flesh wound or whatever but that like you said that was
a catalyst yeah for my case because that was like LSD that was like LSD that came from you know
a batch that I brought into the area so that kid told him your name well he didn't know my name but
you know he knew he told him who he got it from and you know this is how the feds do the feds
it's like dominoes yeah you know so let's say something happens to you they're like who do you
get it from oh I got it from him you know and he got it from him and it's just it's like dominoes
you know that's how the feds do because they go and threaten you know especially you know back
then they go and threaten you know middle-class kids tell them they're gonna go to jail for ten or
life and they do they play it up they say like oh yeah you're gonna end up in the cell with fucking
big bubba what do you think it's gonna fucking happen yeah they really sell it to you yeah man
you know and and like I say I'm not saying whatever you know you break the law you get caught
you got to do time but you know the more the older I've gotten I look at how the system is you know
the war on drugs all that I mean everybody can say now that the war on drugs was wrong pretty much
but it's it's more than the war on drugs man you got to look at the way law enforcement operates
you got to look at the way you know that they try to manipulate people and the things they say I
mean really if you think about it dude that she is like fucking evil man yeah those are some you
know some of those dudes are just doing their jobs and you know they're probably decent dudes and
they probably let motherfuckers offer some little bullshit or some weed or whatever but the whole
concept of that whole war on drugs and law enforcement and forcing people to inform you
know on their friends you know become an outcast or whatever I mean I'm not even gonna say take
it to like you know it's not not like we were the mafia so it's not like anybody was you know
fearing for their lives because they snitched but I'm saying just that's like you know traumatic to
put somebody you know like like what do you think most people do oh you're gonna go to jail
tend to life and big bubble is gonna be your cellmate right you know you're fucking like a 18
year old fucking white kid and you know you just want to fucking go to college and party right
yeah you know so you know at the time when all that should happen right my first five years in
prison you know I was pretty angry you know and I'd be like all fuck these snitches rat-ass
motherfuckers you know whatever you got to be hard play the convict rolling shit you're in prison
you know gotta put the mask on and all that shit but you know now I look at it you know as a
years went by and I got older I just look at it more like I mean it's a system it's a system
that's fucked up I mean you know you still might got some pure say oh well somebody shouldn't
told somebody no the system is what is fucked up to make people have to make those choices
what was the story leading up to your final arrest to when you actually went to prison like
explain the story how you're on the when you're on the run and you had to you did some research
and you figured out how to create a bunch of fake identities and then you tried to eventually fake
your death yeah well you know that the fake identity started basically you know getting fake
ID to go to bars you know because I was all the East Coast colleges so I had a bunch of buddies
at West West Virginia University right in Morgantown and it was like you could just go up there
and you know you need a fake I you need a fake ID for the bars on Main Street so you would just
go down in somebody's room and they would like have all the photography stuff everything set up
you know where they could process it you know the computer stuff and print it out and that's when
I start first started getting fake IDs you know so I had a bunch of like I was 17 18 19 I got a
whole bunch of fake IDs just to go to the bars at the colleges you know I mean it's it's like
some bullshit you know it's not going to stand up but you know at night you know going in with
the bouncers that shit's good enough yeah it's good enough so that was kind of like my first
experience with fake IDs so then when I caught the case you know and I and I started deciding like
you know I was gonna take off I already had some fake IDs but I was like man these they're not
gonna you know stand the test of time you know like in the daylight with a cop right you know I'm
like this shit ain't gonna work so you got like holograms and shit built into them but
whether it was it like that back then yeah yeah they they have like the little holograms but it
would be like I mean it would it would just be like pressed or something right it would try to
emulate a hologram but it would be like pressed on the plastic or whatever so I mean it really you
know wasn't that good but so I started I was like man I gotta find a real ID and I'd actually read
this book the book that they made into a movie you know they made the movie catch me if you can
mm-hmm like whatever like 2000 or something early 2000s but the dude wrote the book like in the
mid-80s you know he wrote that book so I'd actually read that book and I'd read other stuff like that
and I was kind of interested in stuff like that you know for I want to say from like a criminal
pursuit but more you like from a scholarly or academic pursuit you know I've always been a big
reader so I was I was interested in basically like how people would like and I don't even want to
say fraud but just how like how people get over mm-hmm you know not like in a fraudulent way like
ripping people off from money just how people would like get over on authority you know that's
always kind of been my thing and I found these companies man they had these companies
palette and press loom panics unlimited and it was like subversive books like probably one
of the most famous books that a lot of people have heard of that these companies sold was
the anarchist cookbook which in the mid 90s you know exploded you know when the internet you
know came around and the anarchist cookbook came out and basically taught everybody how to make
meth mm-hmm so that's probably the most famous but these companies all they sold was like these
subversive you know underground books how to do you know and it's all protected by the First
Amendment right so I'm not even sure if these companies like after the Patriot Act I think they
you know put these companies out of business so I'm not even sure if they still exist but
um they had like you could get their catalogs and they had like this whole section on like
getting fake ID right but not even fake ID like real ID so what I did is I ordered like all these
books man I ordered like 25 books it was like there was this one author like uh it was like
called Reborn in America Trent Sands they had this whole series called the paper trip it was like
the paper trip one two three four you know they have like books like Understanding U.S. I did
identifying documents you know just like a litany of books man I mean they had like a whole
there's probably 40 or 50 of these books so I ordered like 25 and I just I read them all man
I read them like from cover to cover and it's that's the type of dude I am too like when I want to
do something I like to read I like to research and I like to read and I like to get as much
knowledge as I can about it but then I like to make my own plan you know I'm saying based off
the information you know that I attained mm-hmm you know because because sometimes you would read
one of these books and there might be like one page or like one chapter that I actually learned
something you know because a lot of it was just like rehash you know a lot of these books rehash
but there might be one insight that the author gives you you know that you can take and it's
very valuable so um yeah I did that and I basically learned to you know what they call paper
trip and that was like I would get real ID from the from the Department of Motor Vehicles you
know licenses you know like what they call the Walker Walker licenses you know like not a driver's
license just a walker's ID and and I would basically I would do this what I learned from
these books is you want to find a candidate that died before he was five you know so find
someone that passed away for whatever whatever reasons you know died before they were five and
you wanted to find somebody that was born in one state and died in another state because
um you know back then even though they even back then they probably had the technology but you
know they didn't have the money to cross reference all these records so let's say like if you're
born in Tampa Bay and you die in Tampa Bay it's like the same department right same place they
call it it's like the vital health records or you know department of vital statistics or
whatever so they they they match your records up and they'll stamp deceased on the birth certificate
but if you die in one if you die in one state and you're born in another state especially different
states I mean you know I mean they don't even do it on a state level probably like even in
Florida they don't even do it you know it's different counties but definitely they don't do it
across state lines so once I found this out I would scour the obituaries right so I would I would
go through obituaries and I would look this was my candidate you know I would look for a candidate
somebody that was under five and the reason I would pick somebody under five because typically
you know especially back then you know in this like the 70s like I was born 1971 so I was looking
somebody you know that was born like anywhere from 68 to 70 you know 76 I had about an eight year
window but especially back then before before you were five you didn't get a social security number
you know I mean I don't know nowadays they may give it to you younger you know what I'm saying
but back then you know you they didn't get it you a social security number sometimes not until
you were like a teenager you know you started working really yeah wow yeah so things were
different back then you know so um you would want a kid under five because then they don't have any
other you know records of vital statistics so it's just basically the birth certificate so I would
look for the I would look through the obituaries and in the obituaries I'm looking for this candidate
and then from the obituary you basically um you know get a lot of information that you need to order
the birth certificate right from the obituary I would get like to order somebody's death certificate
you need to know their name place of death date of death right so I could find somebody there
I get those three things I order the death certificate then with the obituary and the
death certificate I can get the five things that I need for the birth certificate because get the
birth certificate you need like a full name place of birth date of birth father's full name
mother's maiden name right and and like I say these are just the vital you know
statistic bureaus or whatever so I mean basically you you write a letter you know you do it through
a mail drop you know like a p.o. box that looks like a real address you know and you you send them
a money order you know like eight or ten dollars and you say like basically like you know I'm the
person's father or I'm the person's you know and it just has to be a relative you know until you
write and then once you got the obituary you find the candidate you get the death certificate
to get all the information you need for birth certificate once you get the birth certificate
you're pretty much home free because look I can get that birth certificate and you know now this is
like whatever you know I'm like I'm like I'm like 20 so and a lot of times it maybe the older you get
it's harder to do and it's probably harder to do now because they got identity theft and all that
back then they didn't even have identity theft they didn't have identity theft to like around the
mid 90s or something yeah you know so it wasn't even back then you could legally have
an ID in someone else's name as long as you weren't using it for fraudulent purposes wow
I mean but you know that's that's like America you know that's what America used to be yeah
stuff like that you know it's changed a lot but so once I got the birth certificate I was home free
because then I could go in to any DMV right and the only a lot of times if you just get the walkers
license not the driver's license all you need is a birth certificate and like an address you know
like you know addresses as you live here you know like an electric bill or something like that you
know in that name right and to get the driver's license you just need to verify a social security
number and so what I used to do to verify a social security number I had this book it was called
Understanding U.S. Identifying Documents and in the understanding U.S. Identifying Documents
each state has like a your first three numbers and your social security number are by state
so each state has like you know from you know whatever 039 to 042 so that determines the state
then the two middle numbers go by the year but it's not like if you were born in 71 the middle
two numbers are going to be 71 it's like if you were born in 71 in that state the numbers might
be two three but it's all done by a chart it's all like corresponding they have these charts in the
book you know because that's what the social security administration people use and then the
last four numbers are random so what I would do is you know depending on where the person was born
I would fucking determine what the number is I would look at the charts you know in the years
and everything and then I would determine that and then um and then like I would get a W2 form
right and I would put that social security number and that person's name you know whose identity
I was going to assume and I'd make it seem like I worked at like some local place you know restaurant
or whatever and I'd write their address and I'd do a W2 form just like you know they give you a W2
form and you can get W2 forms from like any uh like business wholesale supply company you go by
like a box of like those government those government printed you know like I mean I don't
I don't know what it is now but back then you know because everything's probably electronic now but
back then it's like you know these multi you know like so it makes like five copies yeah yeah the
carbon copies yeah yeah yeah yeah that's so you know you could just type it right on I have type
right I would type that shit on and then I would go and I'd have the birth certificate I would have
the uh W2 to verify my social security even though the social security was fake it under scrutiny
the social security number would not stand up because it was fake but a lot of times when
you just go the driver's license you know that social security more like if you went to a bank
or you try to open a bank account because I did that a couple times I tried to open a bank account
under these assumed names and the social security number never stood up because they would tell me
straight up they'd be like uh are you sure that you're right social security number and I'd be like
oh I think I need to get the fuck out of here yeah we have a guy on here who used to do the same
thing for bank for bank fraud and he would go and uh he would get he would convince homeless guys
he'd pay them for all of their information for their social security number for all of that stuff
give him like 20 bucks he'd spend like a hundred bucks and get five socials oh yeah oh he's probably
killing it huh oh yeah he was killing it yeah I know I know now a lot of people they get those
federal tax numbers you know like the the federal uh it's just like a social security number except
for a business it's like a tax ID number yeah yeah yeah so and and like like dudes will buy like you
can like get like 10 of those I mean I don't know where they get them from but they get like 10 of
them and if they're good like they just use those like social security numbers just for like all
types of different fraud really yeah you know ex cons ex cons are they're not hard to look up you
can like Sunbiz is the Florida like business directory you can you can just type in any name
you can find a list of businesses and look at it find all their EIN numbers most most ex cons most
ex cons are um they basically do like I mean I'm not saying I'm not trying to put a bad name on
ex cons but ex cons that are still doing criminal stuff they basically do like weed stuff and um
like fraud you know because it's it's like you know the least you know once you get in there and
you learn like what they punish you know yeah it has a biggest risk or the biggest reward with
the least risk yeah but um so how many of these fake IDs did you create man I probably had like
25 25 yeah one time wow yeah I had four passports in different names you know my eventual plan
was to get like a quarter of a million cash and fuck off you know because because you know I was
a military brat so look I lived in Germany for two years a little bit closer I lived in Germany
for two years when I was a kid I lived in England for three years so I was familiar with Europe
you know I'm saying so like I was gonna you know but I don't know that a lot of the stuff with with
dealing drugs and I guess with anything in life like you just get used to the lifestyle you know
and then it's just you're just trying to maintain the lifestyle you know so I guess I guess that
could be said for any any walk of life or whatever but uh yeah I never got that quarter of a million
and I never got to Europe yeah clearly right so what what did happen what what happened you know
you had all these IDs you were basically you knew the feds were on to you didn't didn't you
didn't you have like your phone tapped didn't you and your friends have like your phones tapped
you knew they were like following you right and they were like pinpointing where you were at and
tracking what you were doing yeah well well not at first I mean you know for two years so I'm a
fugitive for two years so look like the first six months like I'm paranoid like I think like
the feds got that power you know because when you go through a situation like that especially as a
young kid and basically you know all your friends tell on you and um you're just like you think the
feds are like omnipotent right but in reality right they're not omnipotent all their information
they're they're getting from the people that you know you know what I'm saying yeah so
so at first you know I'm telling they I mean they can't tap people's phones and all that but
that that with me that came like that was like maybe like a like when the US marshals were like
hot on my trail like right at the end you know they were kind of tracking my movements through
like a 1-800 beeper you know but that was like like right at the end but you know so for the first
six months I would say I was pretty paranoid because I thought they had all these powers
and plus I was fucked up you know I always tell people it's like um you know that there's this
Jimi Hendrix song you know that it's like called castles made of sand and it's like you know castles
made of the sand slip in the sea eventually and that was kind of like like my story you know because
you know I made myself into this like you know want to be rock star or whatever but it was all
based you know on my ability to move weed and LSD you know and when that foundation was like ripped
out from under me by the feds I mean I was fucked up I didn't know who I was you know so you know
it's all this shit and then you know I take off I'm a fugitive I can't even be my real name so
that first six months you know a lot of paranoia a lot of like you know you're just like questioning
like you know who the fuck am I what am I doing you know is this the right thing but you know at
the same time the fucking alternative you know snitch on your fucking friends or do 20 life I mean
you know you're just like fuck but uh you know after six months it took me about six months I'd
say I started getting my mojo back in um first I went out out to LA I was in Hollywood you know I
had a little bit of money I spent it though really quick like when six months I spent all the money
I had so I ended up back in Dallas Texas with my weed connect this dude you know Mexican Eddie who
had a trucking line was bringing weed over from Matamoros up to Dallas and I started selling weed
in um you know like Texas in Dallas but uh I mean down there it was like back then like ounces were
going for like 60 so it was like you really couldn't make a lot of money so I was kind of selling weed
to like this uh there was this restaurant it was called Harrogans and um I was kind of selling weed
to like the restaurant crowd you know um I lived with this dude he was a cook um he was actually
from Missouri so one weekend he was like hey dude I'm gonna go home you know and fucking go party
he was like you want to come and I'm like shit and I'm like you know people that can sell weed can
you sell some weed he was like fuck yeah so I go to my dude Mexican Eddie you know I grab like
fucking 20 pounds and I'm like fucking we drive up in this dude's truck and fucking uh I didn't even
sell all the weed man I probably only sold like 14 pounds I probably bought six pounds back to Texas
but I made connections and then that was kind of how I made my money in the first place I would like
buy something somewhere at a low cost and I would bring it somewhere else
and sell it for a higher cost I mean that's a basic premise of you know drug smuggling
so uh once I found this out I was like fuck it I was back on you know where I could I had a margin
I could make like a thousand dollars a pound taking that shit up to St. Louis so um I started doing that
kind of got my fucking mojo back you know and basically I had like another little run you know
like another little run probably you know it took probably took me like six to nine months to build
up my clientele where I was making good money and then I had about probably another nine eight
nine month run before before the feds got me and uh how that happened I was actually the same dude
the cook we'll just call him the cook and um he was selling weed for me up there and he was still
working as a cook and uh he was actually working at TGI Fridays right by St. Louis airport and so
we were actually going out to party in the street this place it's called uh St. Charles it's like
Main Street like down down on the river but he needed to go make a drop with one of his guys
you know at TGI Friday so we go to make the drop but you know the the kitchen is so busy
you know it's like on a Friday night his dude can't get off the line so he doesn't make the drop
you know and it's not even a lot of weed it's like a half pound so you know but I don't know this
you know he you know I thought he made the drop so whatever you know my bad you know or whatever
but he didn't tell me so then we go and I make a drop you know I dropped like two pounds with this
guy and uh you know we're waiting in the back of a Burger King parking lot and you know we're
about to go out and party and I'm just waiting for money and I don't think my dude has any weed
and he doesn't say nothing so you know we're sitting in the back of Burger King parking lot and we're
just fucking smoking joints like fucking crazy you know what I'm saying and and this is another
fucking uh you know turn of bad luck so it just so happens like we were in the Burger King first
we're eating but you know when people do drug deals they take forever so you know I give this
dude two pounds he goes down to the trailer park it's taking him fucking forever to bring the
fucking money so we eat in the Burger King we go out we're smoking fucking joints and um just so
happened this Burger King had got robbed like a week before and they had gone in the back
so they see us out in the fucking back in a truck and they fucking call the cops on us you
know the cops roll up and the fucking they can smell the weed you know so boom they're like
fucking on us and you know I'm thinking we're we're cool like whatever I got a couple of joints on
me you know what the fuck they're gonna do you know what I'm saying but uh dude had a half pound
and a guitar case and they found that so they rested us both brought us in printed us and still
I'm good because it's it's not my car I'm under fake ID and it's his weed so I mean he got a ticket
whatever I mean it's my weed but you know really I fronted to him it's his weed it's his responsibility
so you know he does the right thing he tells him it's my weed he tells him I don't know anything
about it but they printed me right and when I was a fugitive I had watched all those shows like
America's Most Wanted you know like all all the fucking all the fucking shows you know because
I was interested like did you become more interested in it once you big you were on the run oh of course
I was studying I was like how do they find people hey you know I like how long does it take
you know from so from watching these shows uh I'd seen like serial killers it took them
like 90 days to match up their prints like fucking serial killers right so I was like who the fuck am
I I'm like a little fucking weed fucking LSD dealer nonviolent you know fucking from the suburbs
I'm like who the fuck kids fuck about me but um I had no idea I had no idea I was top 15
us marshals list oh shit yeah top 15 fugitive dude like for whatever fucking reason right
so they match out my fucking prints in like three days and they got the fucking because they they
release me you know because dude he's like it's my charge it's my car it's my weed so they release
me but they ran my prints you know because that's what they do when they arrest people they just
run your prints just to see they mash up my prints and they're like oh you're not fucking this dude
you're fucking Seth Ferrante so fucking the you the fucking uh fugitive task force is like
fucking on my my tail and this dude it's like his real name and like you know he has family in
st. Louis you know I'm saying so they're like all on his grandparents and his fucking mom and shit
and he's all like fucking freaking out and then he starts fucking cooperating and uh that was when
it was like the little thing like the seven days where they were like tracking my movements
because they were trying to see because you know I had some weed so I was selling weed and the dude
the cook who got busted knew I had weed and I was trying to you know I know I got arrested
but I had no idea they're going to match my prints in the fugitive task force was looking for me
but still I'm still like I need to get the fuck out of dodge because they're going to match my
prints up in like fucking 16 to 90 days and they're going to find out who I am so I'm trying to
fucking move this weed and then I'm gonna fucking take the money and I'm gonna go fucking you know
just basically go somewhere where nobody knows me and hide out but you know I didn't have the
opportunity because they were fucking on me and is that when you tried to fake your death
oh no yeah I skipped that part so uh we go back to that that was when I left so when I left in 91
right that was like I told you I was doing everything with the books I was I was coming
up with the fake ID plan right and then this was like my my grand plan right after getting the
fake IDs because I knew if I was gone like after seven years like if I just disappeared like after
seven years like you could be declared legally dead in this country okay like if you just disappear
without a trace and nobody finds a body or nothing like in seven years you're going to be
declared legally dead so that was like my that was like my grand plan because I was like
how the fuck can Seth Ferrante just go away and these charges just go away and I can just be okay
you know and just live as somebody else and I was like you know after seven years my parents
would have to declare me legally dead so what I did is I I got the fake ID and I was ready to go
and I have a little bit of money but you know then I wanted to throw something extra into it you
know I wanted to fake my suicide because that was like my plan then boom I fake my suicide my body
washes out to the Atlantic Ocean they never find my body seven years I'm declared legally dead no
Seth Ferrante no federal case you know so I'm good I can just live my life as whoever you know but um
so I made this whole big plan there's this place in northern Virginia it's called Great Falls it's
like a national park and it's like it's like a lot of cliffs and it's like rapids and um it's
it's kind of famous like uh among kayakers because they got like what they call class five rapids
and like all the superstar kayakers like to go kayak there because class five is like you know like
you don't want to unless you're like superstar kayaker you don't want to kayak there it's like
uh like a black diamond of skiing yeah basically or even like double black diamond yeah but uh
yeah so it's basically like if you fall in the water there there's so many rocks in the in the
river so uh you know moves so much it's so rapid that you know you're gonna you're done yeah knocked
unconscious drown yeah so from being in that area in northern Virginia and going to high school there
I used to remember uh you know I was always a big sports guy so I remember you know back then it
was newspapers you know it wasn't the internet so every day I would like ripple with a Washington
post and I would go to the sports section before the sports section is the metro section so sometimes
you know I might catch the headline on the metro section and I remember people always
committing suicide there at great falls because they would jump in the water and get smashed
against the rocks and drowned so it was like it was like a you know it was like a popular spot for
suicides you know interesting so die in nature peacefully so I remember this right so then when
all this comes about I'm like boom great falls fake my suicide disappear seven years declared
legally dead no case so that's my whole plan right so I make this whole plan you know I do a
suicide note I park my car there I stage a little uh you know I make a little setting on the side of
the cliffs you know like with uh you know with like my clothes my wallet I put like a vodka bottle
you know I like even leave money in my wallet you know like a pack of cigarettes you know some
weed like I was sitting there you know Compton playing the suicide I even leading up to this for
like two weeks I was even like dropping hints to people you know people that I knew are people
that I was around like oh man I don't know if I can take this you know blah blah blah whatever
and um so I staged my suicide you know and and um I actually I was on the on the cliffs like it's
an area where you're not supposed to be you know it's not necessarily roped off but it's just like
you know off the path and I waited until some people came by like some joggers I went up there
and I'm like my friend jumped and then I just rolled out you know and I had somebody waiting
for me and I went in the car you know then they took me to the airport and I flew to California
you know but um I found out years later those people because when I was in prison I got all
the uh Freedom Information Acts and those people actually did like a report with a park ranger
like they were the people who reported it you know that I went in yeah but um you know when
that first happened I was out in LA in Hollywood and I'm reading the papers every day right because
I want to see like I'm I'm declared dead right so first it comes out and it says like you know
Fairfax LSD Kingpin commit suicide and I'm like fuck yeah I'm like my plan's gonna work
and dude I'm like 20 so you know I'm like fucking you know like I'm saying I mean I was a smart
kid for 20 but still I'm like 20 so I'm like incredibly naive and a lot of things you know but
you know you know think you're that age and you're like man like something you planned you know
monumental and it's fucking going down right but so then I kept reading the fucking things right and
then like two weeks later dude I was just like fucked up like just fucking like heartbroken
because I read the headline it said fucking it said the US Attorney's Office you know calls the
Fairfax LSD Kingpin suicide of hoax and I was like what so I fucking start reading it right and I
read the fucking article dude and it's like crazy because I'm like literally driving down like back
and then they had newsstands you know so like you go to the newsstands to get like the newspapers
from different areas you know I'm saying like in the big cities so I'm like literally going down
there I'm like running to the newsstand it's like a big magazine newsstand I'm like ripping off the
paper and I'm like reading there I'm just sitting on like you know Hollywood Main Street Russell
and Bustle read in this shit and fucking just like you know I mean on the outside I probably look
cool but like on the inside you know my fucking heart is just crushed because they said it's a hoax
because what I did I planned everything brilliantly right but I I committed I staged my suicide
on the wrong side of the fucking dam right so my body didn't wash out to sea
right they dragged the river for two weeks right by the dam yeah and they didn't find a body so
when they didn't find a body they told the prosecutors there's no body the park rangers
and so they said it's a hoax so you know I mean I thought I was smart but you know in retrospect
I was probably a little dumbass whoa were you in touch with any of the people in your life after
that did you let them know like hey this is not real I'm still alive like what about your parents
like anybody only only my mom the dude that drove me to the airport was actually my god brother
somebody who I knew my whole life you know basically like you know grew grew up with him
and um so he told my mom you know that I didn't commit suicide but everybody else
you know for at least that first two weeks yeah that one lady they were interviewing
they she said when she found out that you'd committed suicide or saw the article or something
she was instantly like no way wait a second this guy could never kill himself he's too much of a
sociopath yeah that's my girl that's my girl Mars she knew me pretty well though but uh
yeah but um yeah so that was like the whole suicide thing and then um like the reason I even became
top 15 it's it's it's like fucked up too because there was this dude named Henry Hudson for my case
he was the assistant us attorney like during my case so I mean I don't know I wasn't privy to what
was going on inside the us attorney's office but you know in retrospect and kind of looking at
everything and how it happened this dude could have been like the driving factor in my case
like I said I can't say that you know unequivocally or whatever but you know I'm just like you
know making assumptions on on everything that happened so this dude could have been like Henry
Hudson he could have been like the driving factor in my case for whatever reason you know he wanted
to bust some white lsd marijuana guys you know for whatever reason I don't know maybe he never
got high maybe he had a bad trip I don't know maybe they wouldn't give him any acid at college I don't
know who knows but then as soon as I disappear this dude transfers to the us marshals office in
northern Virginia and he becomes the head of the us marshals office so he makes like this
you know lateral transfer like within you know government you know within within law enforcement
for the federal government so he does all the paperwork to make me top 15 us marshals because
dude I was a first time nonviolent offender dude I mean are you serious like a first time nonviolent
even when I got caught like some of the marshals they're like how are you top 15
like they're looking at me they're like and they basically told me like straight up they were like
who did you piss off yeah you know what I'm saying because that's how that's how fucking
shit works you know how do you think it happened who do you think you pissed off I pissed that
fucking dude Harry Hudson yeah that's who I fucking pissed off he was like you know from
everything I can see that I pieced together you know over the years he was a driving factor in my case
he was the one that was pushing it when I took off it put like a black mark on his record
he took a fence at that he took it personal he went to the us marshals office made me a top 15
fugitive when I shouldn't have never been a top 15 fugitive there was no reason for me to be a top
15 fugitive upset that I pissed this motherfucker off right then when I got caught he gets a feather
in his hat and you're not going to believe where this dude is now he's a fucking four circuit appeals
court judge in Richmond Virginia for the feds all right so look if you look at everything in this
country like if you look at our judicial system and prosecutors and like you know how that okay you
guys know Rudy Giuliani Rudy Giuliani right he was the prosecutor from the Gotti case the John
Gotti case in the 80s so everything in this country in the in the judicial branch is based
like on making a big case you know you advance by winning big cases you don't advance by doing
the right thing you don't advance by advocating justice you know you don't advance there's no
incentive for doing the right thing there's the only incentive is money and moving up the ladder
right yeah and you do that by having these big media cases so basically this dude Henry Hudson
blew my case up into something it wasn't you know not to say whatever I broke the law you know I
should have been punished but I should have got like fucking five years in the state you know what
I'm saying so he blew me up into this big fucking drug kingpin you know took it one step further
blew me up into this top 15 fucking fugitive and then you know in his career his judicial law
enforcement career he capitalized right off that shit that's why like like sometimes I just tell
people like okay I was in prison and I'm not saying there's some fucked up people in prison
there's people that belong in prison you know what I'm saying I mean I'll be the first to say that
you know violent people do belong in prison you know but you got a lot of people that don't belong
in prison but there's just so many cases especially like when we look at the war on drugs in retrospect
where these people like this supposedly doing the right thing they're the fucking most evil
motherfuckers man yeah you know what I'm saying and this dude is a fucking forced circuit
US appeals court judge so this dude is like one step down from the supreme court man
that's how powerful this motherfucker is you know like I say I talk shit about him on a lot of
podcasts so he hasn't sent nobody after me yet but fuck him you know whatever send your fucking dude
you know I'm just that type of dude you know I'm like whatever I'm gonna say what I want if they
want to come and kill me come and kill me he needs to uh he's take some acid or some mushrooms or
I'm saying you know and uh and really my dream my dream is to eventually have like uh
you know like a big scripted series or like a big Hollywood movie and and I want to fucking like
portray like this evil motherfucker for the person he is like he'll be the main really
protagonist yeah and and I just want to show and I'm gonna use his real name and everything
you know I mean I would I don't know maybe they'll want to change his name the lawyers who knows
but uh yeah I want this dude should be exposed man because he's sitting up there like he's this
fucking righteous fucking law abiding person and he basically made his career off of fucking my blood
you know not my literal blood but you know my blood and and having to go to prison and all that you
know and I'm not the only one I'm not saying I'm the only one I mean but that's what he does you
know these people that's what they do in law enforcement and the judiciary in this country
they step on other people make them out worse to be they are and you know if anybody any other
country does it they criticize it but they do the same thing to us and they prop themselves up on
on our backs right you know so I mean to me and you know that's just my own personal thing but I
think those dudes are fucking evil as fuck the DEA evil as fuck you know what I'm saying the CIA
they're good people right so I gotta say I don't really want to talk about the CIA because
they just might come kill me what was it like when you finally got caught for the last time
like what what describe the scenario do you like your doors kicked in like what how did I was actually
I was in this um a conelage in st. Louis right by the airport and and I was actually waiting man
I had like I had like 20 pounds of pot and I had this dude Columbia you know like one of my
distributors well I mean his name was Dave I won't say his last name but his name was Dave so
I'm waiting for Dave to come down and get this 20 pounds because then as soon as he
brings me the money he's up in Columbia you know that's where Mizzou University Mizzou Mizzou is at
so he sold for me up there he was a big volume dealer for me and um he like I told him I'm like
dude I got this fucking 20 pounds you know this was after I you know I had got arrested I knew
they were matching on my prints I knew I need to get the fuck out of here I knew the clock was
ticking so I you know I was like dude I'm gonna give you all this shit for like 500 dollars less
a pound than I normally charge you just I need all cash so he's like okay let me talk to everybody
I'm gonna get it together so he's actually getting together he's actually supposed to come down
like that morning like around 10 or 11 you know and bring me the cash and then I'm gonna like fuck off
right but you know I didn't know everything that's going on behind the scenes you know the
marshals are tracking me and I was taught 15 us marshals lists and all this so I have no idea
another stuff is happening behind the scenes so six o'clock in the morning I'm in this fucking
O'Connell Lodge and and I'm already you know I'm like I know the clock is ticking I know I need to
get the fuck out of here you know I can like feel it you know I'm saying because when you're in
situations like that like you can feel that shit dude you know I'm saying like it's just like you
know it's like the walls fucking closing in on you man like you feel that shit you know even
though I didn't know like I didn't wasn't cognizant of everything that was happening but you know like
your body your mind you can sense that shit so uh yeah they fucking bust in do the the federal
marshals man they bust in like a like probably like six o'clock in the morning you know what I'm
saying they fucking it's just fun it's like fucking three of them it's not even no local law
enforcement like they're just fucking basically scouting me out themselves like you know a lot
of things people don't know about these law enforcement guys but like these dudes are as much
cowboys as a lot of the drug dealers you know a lot of people don't realize that but I mean
these motherfuckers are cowboys like they're fucking they're basically scoping me out they don't have
no local law enforcement they don't have no backup you know it's just it's like three of them you
know they fucking come in you know they're gonna do whatever they want to grab you yeah so they
fucking come in they fucking get me they find the weed you know I have a little bit of money and um
you know actually you know to answer your question I mean it was in a lot of ways it was a relief
because you know I was I mean I was constantly dude I had all these different IDs and
it's like you gotta like school yourself man it's like okay boom like I take out this fucking ID
today and I got it I would have a process in my mind I'd be like okay well I'm fucking uh
Jacob Birchfield today and I'd be like okay Jacob Fertschild bored on this day you know this
cell security number live at this address because you know if somebody ever pulls you over are you
you get addressed by a cop you have to know that shit like it's you yeah right so I would do that
and so every day I'm fucking you know I might do it for like a week you know I'd be this guy for this
week you know and that shit wears on you man and then it also wears on you uh I mean I'm meeting
people all the time you know I'm I'm meeting people you know friends you know some people I like some
people I don't like you know especially you know meeting girls and I mean you can't be yourself
man you got to have like this backstory and none of it is true and then you know you got to constantly
like remember like what you told him or what you told him or you know how these backstories connect
or how they disconnect you know because you don't want to fucking you know just as a basic premise
you don't want to fucking people think oh he's full of shit he's a liar you know I'm saying nobody
would want to be considered that so uh you know just trying to coordinate like all this stuff in
my fucking mind I mean that's a lot of fucking that's intense shit you know I'm saying and plus
you know I mean I'm not gonna lie too I was fucking probably smoking weed like crazy you
know drinking like crazy to handle you know whatever stress or whatever but you know it's all like
mental stress that I put on myself because of my situation so um yeah when they got when I got caught
you know I like I told them like you know I didn't try to lie and say you know they're like you're this
you're Seth I'm like yeah I'm Seth cool whatever you got me you know what I'm saying so it was it
was it was kind of like a relief but uh you know at the same time to show you like um you know I know
I keep hammering this about the evilness of these motherfuckers but like you know they're looking
through all my shit they find the weed they find the guns or not guns I didn't have any guns so they
find the weed they find the money they find all the IDs and then like they're asking me they're like
you got guns you got guns you know because any if you know if you're if you're involved with the feds
like any you get a gun for any criminal act in the feds a gun is like five extra years so like
these motherfuckers they don't give a fuck they just want to give you time you know I'm saying
that's like their job is to get catch you and give you time you know the more time the better
so they're like they're like no guns no guns I'm like no I don't have no fucking guns you know I'm
like I never had a gun I don't deal with people where I need a gun I'm not that type of fucking
criminal you know so like the one Marshall dude like he takes his fucking gun out and like he
throws it in my bag and then he's like oh he's like what's this he's like you got a fucking gun
you know what I'm saying I mean obviously he didn't put that gun on me you know he picked it back up
but I'm saying that's just like shows you like the mentality like like why would you even do that
dude like like you that's how what do you mean threw it in your bag just like joke with you or
what yeah yeah I do fuck with you yeah to fuck with me dude but they didn't charge you with it no
but I'm saying but I'm saying like what type of person would do some shit like that like you think
that shit is funny right yeah you know what I'm saying I know what I'm looking at dude I'm looking
at fucking 20 to life that's why I fled you know what I'm saying it's a fucking height of the war
on drugs the laws are fucked up you know I know what the fuck I'm looking at and you're gonna
fucking try to play me like that and you're like a law enforcement you know you're supposed to be
the good guy good guys don't do shit like that you know I'm saying it and especially like look
I'm not resisting arrests I'm telling you who I am you know I'm not fucking trying to go out like
fucking Billy the kid or no shit like that or Bonnie the Clyde Bonnie and Clyde whatever if you're
a criminal you're trying to go out like buying the Clyde whatever law enforcement do what you
got to do that's your job but I'm saying in these other situations man you know what I'm saying
you know to introduce shit like that it just shows like their whole that whole culture man
is inherently fucking evil when it comes to the war on drugs and like I think like our whole
judicial system right now look they created a couple things that is the reason why our law
enforcement is how it is today right first they did this thing called qualified immunity
we're basically like a cop or a law enforcement or a federal agent they can do whatever they
want to do under the guise of their job and get away with it right isn't that the law that says
that they can't get sued for yeah it's called that's what that's what qualified immunity right
so as long as they do it under the color or the auspices of their job they can do whatever they
can fucking just come and clock you in the fucking face beat the fuck out of you right isn't that
all changing now though I mean I think there's more there's more discussions there's some states
where the I think some of these laws are changing and let's get it's being challenged it needs to
I think it's more like it's been challenged it's been talked about I don't know how much it's been
changed yeah stuff is slowly changing for the better but I'm saying this is one of the worst
things it has made us why basically we've become a police state right now right the second thing
is the forfeiture dude right like the forfeiture like dude you can literally and I'm not saying
it doesn't it happens to some white people but you don't happen to white people as much but people
of color like african-american or you know spanish no brown people they bust and pull them over or
find a joint and they take their fucking car dude I mean it happens all the fucking time dude I'm
be probably more in the 90s than it does now but you know I mean dude and look think about this and
and I know you guys have probably seen this even even down here right okay so they got a big bust
they get the fucking money and I'm not saying I mean some cops are corrupt they might put that
money in their pocket you know I mean but you know more times than not they they're not putting the
money in their pocket you know sometimes they are but you know more times than not they're not
but all that money is going to their department and then you see like the head of the department
the fucking sheriff is driving this big fucking gmc fucking ucon fucking denali all fucking loaded
out like a hundred and fifty thousand dollar fucking car as his company car because they use
the forfeiture forfeiture proceeds the drug money to do that so I'm saying if that's not corrupt
dude I mean that's fucking corrupt on its face you know what I'm saying yeah because that dude is
driving around that car that's his car why does the sheriff have to drive around a fucking hundred
and I'm sure you guys have seen it down here because this is kind of like some country boy
shit I see it up in Missouri like up in Missouri like some of the police departments or the sheriffs
they have like these big fucking four-wheel drive fucking police trucks dude like outrageous like
some shit you would see on fucking monster truck yeah and they drive and they got all their flags
and it says fucking st. Charles county police right and I know you see that shit down in Florida
because it's some country boy shit down here too yeah right dude that is outrageous where do you
think they get that money the taxpayers didn't give them that fucking money so you're saying that
the money that they can they can that they seize in these drug operations whether they
raid a house or somewhere like that they keep that to buy trucks they keep it for their department
to buy whatever they need so the department gets to keep that money yeah they keep really yeah who
that whatever the seizing whoever seizes it you know like even if the feds are involved
that money goes back to the local agency hmm you know the feds might take a percentage
but you know the feds don't need money the feds fucking print money they got the money the feds
print fucking they don't fucking need no money so look so all right so those two things so you
got qualified immunity and you got forfeiture and then the third thing so you got you got basically
law enforcement in this country they can do whatever they want to do and get away with it
they fucking basically go after fucking drug dealers just to get money you know I'm saying
that that's like they don't even care about what's right or wrong or the laws or you know what laws
are being broken or who's getting fucked over yeah they're just going for the money that's
what it's turned into they're just going for the money because the forfeiture laws and the third
thing that has turned our law enforcement in this country to this big bloated fucking entity that's
fucking feeds on itself and is evil as fuck right the third thing is the fucking informants because
look these dudes are detectives like you got detectives like in law enforcement or agents
or investigators they don't investigate nothing dude all they do is threaten people with time and
people tell them whatever they want here they don't investigate so they have they have no
investigative skills they're not fucking detectives they can't figure fucking nothing out the only
type of bus they want is a bus they get some money for their department and they have no
accountability because you know if they arrest you and you say man fuck you pig they can punch
you in your fucking face and bust your fucking teeth out yeah and say whatever and and they
don't have no criminal case they don't have nothing nothing happens and a lot of times they
don't even get suspended you know what I'm saying so that's why we're at the point where we are
right now you know with law enforcement and like and look I'm gonna break this down for you even
further all right see look we're all fucking white right so a lot of the cops are white so
you know sometimes I mean they could be asshole to us but sometimes they can look at us too and
be like oh you know he kind of looks like my cousin or my brother or my family member right
so they might be a little bit more lax with us you know I'm saying but think like but they still
I'm not saying they beat the shit out of fucking white people you know if you get lippy with them
they'll beat the fuck out of you they don't give a fuck you know they can't do nothing but think
about like the black and brown people dude like they don't give a fuck they treat those motherfuckers
like subhuman and get away with it every fucking day well I mean you see it way more nowadays
because of the internet and social media and I'm sure they got I'm sure you know cops definitely
got away with it way more in the 70s and the 80s and the early 90s but with like the way things
are changing now the tables have kind of turned now if you're a cop and you're a piece of shit
it's easier for you to be exposed no true and and you know being I mean think of like who
who would want to be a cop who would want to be a person who has to go into these places
and have to be constantly worried about your own life you know pulling I mean just just imagine
like pulling over a car at night and ask them to roll down the window I mean the amount of cops
that get shot I mean you're worried about your own life I don't think I mean I can see that to a
certain extent but I think I don't I don't think it's I mean basically man people are people yeah
if you treat somebody like a person and give them respect you know because dude I've been around
cops prison guards everything you know if they treat you all right you know you treat them all
right whatever you got to do your job you know I got to do my job especially if you're criminal
but I mean I could say some of it I mean every everything in life goes both ways but look I'm
gonna throw something else at you and this is what law enforcement does all right if you're a
law enforcement and think most people when they do their job they just want to do the easiest job
possible right so if you're in law enforcement right who would you rather go bust unless you're
like some gung-ho fucking super marine cop and they're all those type of dudes there's those
type of yeah but you know they're not they're like you know one out of a hundred but who would you
rather go bust would you rather go bust the fucking meth fucking attics or cocaine fucking
cartel members with fucking machine guns and shit or would you go rather go bust the fucking
kids smoking marijuana or the fucking marijuana nonviolent marijuana dealer look you know
what are the what are the most arrests for fucking drugs in our country every year dude
instill now and it's legal in half the states marijuana is still the number what marijuana
has been their biggest cash cow dude look at one time I don't marijuana still the number one
dude I'm telling you number one thing people are arrested for the US yeah they don't want to let
it go man they don't want to let it go I mean it is changing but we're in this process now like it
might take another five to ten years dude I mean people are still catching cases for fucking weed
dude it's fucking crazy dude yeah you know I'm saying I mean they're not getting the same severe
punishments yeah you know but it's still fucking the same and especially you know if you're a
fucking well I mean it's what it's what I don't it's the system right it's what they're incentivized
to do it's a it's a it starts at the top it doesn't start at the bottom I mean no it starts when you
build a system that's based it incentivizes people to you know meet a quota you know to to make more
money and to raise more money for your department and that's why motion that's like my whole point
my whole point like everything I brought up and like it all stems from my case because I see this
all in whatever I see this all from a color view because I see it all from the point of my case
and what happened to me but as all that has happened to me I've seen a lot of other stuff so
that's I mean that's been my whole point it's evil man it's inherently evil like the whole system
the way it's made I'm saying there's a lot of people individual people they're just doing their job
you know I don't blame the individuals you know I mean if you're a bad apple you're a bad apple
I mean the truth is going to come out in the wash you know but the way the whole system you
know from the war on drugs down and law enforcement is fucking inherently evil and I know a lot of
people in law enforcement dude I like for my work do my documentary work I've I've interviewed fucking
retired DEA I've interviewed retired FBI you know ATF like I say I don't got no beef with
these dudes whatever they did their job you know whatever they thought they were doing the right
thing you know I can't blame them whatever circumstance they were in in life right but
sometimes like even I talk to these dudes and like especially these DEA dudes and I'm just like
like they cannot admit that the war on drugs was wrong really no a lot of them I mean some of them
have come out and said but a lot of them you know the rank and file you know because I mean whatever
if you spend 20 30 years of your life doing something dude you're not just going to be like
you know it takes big balls to be like oh yeah it was fucked up you know so a lot of me and like
I say it goes to me this whole thing it goes back to like like all America like dude I'm still
America I love my country I'm not going to go you know they put me in prison for 21 fucking years
you know like I'm like you know to me it's like the matrix right like I got out I'm like plug me back
into the matrix you know what I'm saying I mean the prison fucking sucks dude that shit's like the
netherworld of corruption and violence what kind of prison were you in I was in like I did 12 years
in medium highs and I did nine years in lows okay so you know basically in the feds the medium
highs they call them gladiator schools you know a lot of fights you know in the pin I was there in
the penitentiaries the penitentiaries that's like the highs that's where they say like boys state
penitentiaries well the it's a federal penitentiary oh federal penitentiaries but what they say in the
federal penitentiaries like they say boys fight men kill you know like you don't fight like if you
got a beef like you go stab them mother fucker 60 times you know what I'm saying so that's how
that means like boys fight men kill I was in what they call the gladiator schools the medium highs
were like you know basically you got a fight like if you don't fight you know then whatever you know
you can be fucking starting out somebody taking your commissary and end up getting raped you know
what I'm saying I mean that's just how it is you know and then I did my last nine years in the lows
and the lows I mean it's pretty tame you know I'm saying I mean shit happens but a lot of white
collar criminals in there a white collar crime is more like in the camps that's like the minimum
I could never go to the camps I was always behind a fence because I was a top 15 fugitive you know
so I could never go out to the camp you know I would never get minimum security but uh you know
the lows you got like the people that fuck up at the camps so it's a lot of minimum security dudes
you know that fucked up and you got a you know a lot of you even got dudes that started the penitentiaries
but there you know they did 20 years they're at the end of their bid they don't want no problem
and then you got a lot of dudes you know that are just short timers you know they're coming in they
got like two three four five years yeah a lot of informants you know they're but you know it's
funny in prison because even like when you're out of low and you know there's a lot of informants
like nobody everybody's like oh no I didn't snitch he's a snitch I'm not a snitch it's like crazy dude
it's like you know because nobody wants to wear that in there you know nobody's gonna wear that
shit right you know I found out like I got all the time that I did it basically came down to it
like usually the person that was going trying to say who was the snitches like usually you
have to like look at them right because like why like they're deflecting yeah it's like why are you
pointing out you know some of some of the dudes like that they're just crazy and hate snitches
you know but you know a lot of times you know I mean but that's maybe like one out of ten you
know like the other nine times out of ten it's usually somebody deflecting yeah that's a it's a
it's a crazy subject that always gets brought up when you go to prison or you get caught with you
know on it with a big crime is like the first thing you think of is you know you could offer
to plea deal are you gonna snitch are you not gonna snitch and that's like the number one question
people ask you when you're when you're locked up like they ask you about your crime they try to
like poke and prod little questions figure out more about your story is he a snitch is he not a
snitch when I came in you got to show paperwork so when I came in in 93 I came in 93 I went to FCI
in Manchester it's a medium high in Kentucky right I got 25 fucking years and this is like 93 so
when I came in you know a lot of the people are still under the old laws from the 80s
so I come in with 25 and I'm like this little kid I look like a college kid right
I'm like fucking you know 22 years old man I weigh maybe like 185 you know what I'm saying
and fucking clean cut everything look like just being college and the dudes are like all the cons
you know they're looking at me they're like like who the fuck did you kill how did you get 25 years
you know because still they you know they just started those laws like in 89 so you know a lot
of the dudes aren't used to people you know like for for for my crime what I did like in the 80s
that might have been like you know maybe 10 years maximum and it was parolable you know but then
after 89 when they made the new laws you know mandatory minimums the sentencing guidelines
you had to do 85% of your time so there was like no parole so you know like on 25 I had to do
basically you know almost 23 the only reason I got in 21 is because I took this drug program
for 10 months a 500 hour therapeutic drug program and I got a year off my sentence
you know right at the end but uh yeah dude when you when I went in back then it's like
they call it a paperwork party like you go in like wherever you're from like your homeboys come to
you like the other white people you know it's all it's everything's ethic and race and they're race
based you know you don't got like black dudes coming to you asking to see your paperwork
you know your own people white people come to you they want you got to show your paperwork
you got to show that you're not a snitch you got to show that you're not a chomo you know
child molester and you got to show that you're not a rapist because if you're any of those
fucking thing it's like your own people your own homeboys they're going to check you in do
they're either going to beat the fuck out of you and leave you there or they're going to tell you
you're going to be like look you need to roll up dude you got to check in the hole you ain't
walking on this compound you know and that's how shit goes you know what I'm saying so
what would happen if you're like yeah I was a snitch I'm fucking rat it out this guy this guy
this guy cut all their throats and I saved 25 years of my life now what they're gonna
fucking beat the fuck out of you right there they're gonna check you in dude they're gonna
roll you up really walk on that compound fuck no you know but look I have seen I've seen a few
cases where there's been like some fucking tough snitch motherfuckers but you know in the end they
always lose there was a I was in Beckley West Virginia right it was a medium high second joint
I was at and it was a it was a pretty rough and tumble joint man you know it was like
like they were always hitting the dooses like when I say they hit the dooses that's like
if there's a fight or disturbance like you know the cop hits the body alarm and like all the cops
go running you know like the Calvary you know to quell the disturbance so that's what hit the
dooses means so I mean they were hitting the dooses like all the fucking time like you always
see the cops run in so it's a fight here a fight here you know whatever sometimes multiple fights at
the same time so um there's this one dude I don't know his name big dude country boy had like a
cocaine case he was a West Virginia country boy right so he's on the fucking compound
dudes know he's hot right so fucking the like some of the West Virginia dudes you know they
say oh this motherfucker's hot like they show the newspaper articles about him whatever and uh
what does that mean he's hot like he's a snitch he's hot oh yeah he's hot so um they try to check
him in he said I ain't checking any beats the fuck out of him the snitch beats the fuck out of the
dude so like they end up they get beat up there in the hole you know I'm saying they're in the
hole because they got the shit beat I'm because what happens like they're like let's say me you're
you're gonna fight and I beat the fuck out of you and you're all marked up so the cops when they
see you're marked up they're gonna lock you up basically for your protection right and if you
don't say what happened like you you'll say some shit like if you're a stand-up con you'll be like
oh I slipped and fell in the shower or some shit right but they put you in the hole because they're
investigating they want to know what happened you know so so this snitch he beats these fucking dudes
up you know who supposedly like the shot callers for the West Virginia car you know who whatever
they weren't that tough they couldn't even check their own snitch out of the yard so he beats them
up they go the hole but you know they don't say nothing whatever so this dude's like still on the
yard so you know you know the authorities don't know what's going on but like all the white boys
know what's going on right so then fucking so then like some other white boys on the yard
like they go to the rest of the West Virginia dudes and they're like what the fuck man
they're like clean your fucking car dude this is your responsibility you need to get this motherfucker
off the yard so then like some more West Virginia dudes go or they can't do it or whatever so then
like this like was going on dude for like fucking about three weeks you know and this dude was like
fuck you like anybody came at him he beat the fuck out of him like he was a tough motherfucker
but he was a snitch so uh eventually the fucking California dudes usually like in prison for the
white boys usually the California dudes are like the toughest dudes it goes with the Spanish too
usually like the like they call them the serenials the Mexican dudes like they're into the Mexican
mafia they're usually like the fucking most thorough and usually the California the Mexicans
and the in the whites fucking ally so the Mexicans the toughest yeah they're the most vicious why is
that because if like they got a sane in there like if if if you got a beef with one Mexican and
you got to fight all of them that's how that's not like that with any of the other races it can be
but you know not a lot sometimes you know because sometimes it's like uh you know it's supposed
to be everything is like unified like okay we're white we stand together but a lot of times you
know like uh I'll have a beef and you'll be like man fuck him I don't fuck with him or fuck him he's
a piece of shit you know or he's like a fucking junky shit or maybe he fucking owes me money for
some heroin so fuck him you know so it's like shit like that comes into play so eventually with
this fucking West Virginia fucking tough guy fucking snitch the fucking California dudes
fucking cornered him out on the fucking yard with weapons and fucking beat the fuck out of him and
you know but it was like a three-week process so this dude was basically on the yard for three weeks
you know basically like you said yeah I'm a fucking snitch fuck you wasn't whitey bolder a snitch
yeah yeah whitey bolder was snitch and he got he got killed yeah he got killed didn't he get killed
didn't they put a hit on on him because he had some sort of government or part of some conspiracy
right so so what whitey bolder story was he was in a protection there there's a joint down in Florida
it's like it's like a known protection yard so he was he was down there for a long it's a Coleman
Coleman that's where Matt Cox went yeah all right so they got two Coleman's they got a Coleman one
and Coleman two but one of those yards is a protection yard that's like any of the dudes it's
because it's a hi it's a penitentiary so any of the dudes that um like can't walk mainline
can't walk mainline that means like uh mainline is like the prison yard okay that's like the mainline
like you're walking the mainline yeah you know like you're out on the yard you're in general
population that's what mocking mainline means you're in general population so you know if you
can't walk mainline because you know maybe you're a snitch or you got beasts or people are trying to
kill you or you know a gang has marked you for death then you're you can't walk mainline like the
prison authorities won't let you right to protect you yeah so they won't let you even if you say you
want to you know they usually don't let you so this is what happened with whitey bolder so whitey
bolder's he's in Coleman he's in it's a it's a known protection yards he's in there he's walking
mainline because it's a protection yard you know there's a bunch of dudes you know they can't go
any other place because they'll probably get killed and um but then he did something like
i don't know something he had something with some nurse or you know something that he pissed off the
staff pissed off the warden you know or he got you know whatever sassy you know he was an old
motherfucker anyhow so you know whatever he pissed off the staff i don't know who or what might have
been from medical so it went up so they were like and he was defined about it you know he was like
i'll fuck you whatever i'm whitey bolder fuck you and so they were like okay we got something for
you mr whitey bolder we're gonna transfer you to a fucking prison where motherfuckers want to kill you
because you're a fucking rat i mean and none of this is said it's all unspoken you know maybe the
bureau bureau prison staff like in their you know whatever meetings or something they might say
that shit but you know i mean they're never going to get to that shit you know so um they transfer
him and then whitey bolder being whitey bolder you know even though the you know because when you
go to the yard anytime you go to the yard like they ask you they're like you know they ask you if
you want they just put you on the yard like you can go in pc if you want nobody has to go on any yard
if you request pc protective custody they will put you that's your job to protect your life
and especially when you're dealing with these penitentiaries because that's where you got the
real fucking killers and especially when you got somebody like whitey bolder who's this high
profile fucking dude it's been in fucking movies where he's a fucking informant everybody fucking
knows no but whitey bolder was the type of dude he was like his whole thing was like i'm not an
informant i paid for information they worked for me but you know anytime with law enforcement or
criminals especially a criminal like whitey bolder that had such a long reign anybody knows a common
sense of information is going back and forth he's given the dude information about his enemies
because it makes his life easier and in the cop buses you know john connelly was a fbi guy so
so whitey bolder goes to this prison it's it's actually uh it's a west virginia prison i can't
think of which one but it i think it was a west virginia penitentiary so he goes to this prison
and um like they basically tell him you know like you know you fear for your life or whatever
you got any beefs with anybody you know can you go on the yard and he's like you know whitey bolder
is trying to pull you know he's old but he's still like i'm whitey bolder i'm a tough guy he's like
yeah i can go in this fucking yard and so the cops let him you know but i mean they never
should have let him they they knew better but it was like that's why they say that the whole thing
it was like a vendetta by the b.o.p like it's some you know high you know not like the normal
cops but like somewhere like at the regional office or the central office they were like man
fuck this dude let's let him get killed yeah let him thin for himself that's the conspiracy
i mean but you know you can probably never prove it i mean they probably had investigations or
whatever but so so they put him out but you know i mean but whatever i don't know you think sometimes
like these dudes they're old they're in bad health you know maybe uh they want to go out like that i
don't know maybe you know they want to end their life i mean who knows what's going on in his mind
you know or maybe he really thought i'm whitey bolder ain't nobody gonna do nothing to me you
know he's in a fucking wheelchair i don't know maybe he was yeah fucking crazy maybe he did
too much lsd i don't know yeah yeah that's that's the that's what a lot of people say he did too
much lsd yeah so i mean he was in the mk ultra program right you know i used to i used to and
that was before he killed everybody right yeah when he when he did his first bit in alcatraz
you know i used to i wrote i used to write what whitey bolger did you really i was trying to
get him to do a book really when he was in colman did he ever respond to you did you
fucking roll me a bunch of letters really yeah i got a bunch of letters dude his writing is like
fucking chicken scratch like it's like the type of letters like you can barely fucking read like
you gotta like like it's work to read his letters yeah yeah but i wrote him i actually i did i did
a couple articles where i used some of his words from his letters for this uh site called ozzy and
i actually i had a dude on my site website guerrilla convict dot com he was in the west
virginia prison where whitey bolger got whacked and he wrote an article about it
really yeah it's on it's on my website guerrilla convict dot com what did uh you and whitey bolger
talk about did you ask him about the lsd stuff yeah he wrote he wrote some you know told me about
that but i mean basically i was getting him i was trying to say like dude let me write your biography
so he was telling me like little things like he was telling me about that mk ultra and he was
trying to tell me you know he's not a snitch and he was trying to tell me you know how the
prisons fucked up or what they do to him like all his little petty grievances he was like airing
out to me that was mostly what the letters consist of he'd give me some history but mostly you know
is how fucked up his case was and they railroaded him you know because a lot of those dudes they get
in there especially the older dudes they get life and they just get obsessed with these like they got
like these three or four trigger things and they just can't let them go you know and then they just
eat them up really and that's all they can talk about i mean i think that happens to people a
lot in life anyhow but in there it's it's intensified like when you're doing a life sentence around a
whole bunch of violent people you know in there in there it's like i'm gonna show you like what
prison is like like you got to put this mask on you got to put this every day like you got to wear
this mask because it's it's about to keep yourself safe you got to keep people away you got to think
make people think like you're crazy or you're violent or you're negative so it's like it's like
almost like like you you make shit more than is like you know like shit might happen to you
you know or like maybe the fucking they don't give you your transfers or the cop takes your tomato
you know writes you some bullshit shot so you fucking you're like really you know like demonstrative
you're like man fuck these motherfuckers man there's some fucking bullshit you know because you're
like you it's like you you emanate fucking like negativity to like keep motherfuckers at bay and
keep them arms like to keep away from you because all that shit is based on it's based on built on
negativity man in all prison is it's like really prison it's a lot like law enforcement sometimes
because you just kind of uh it's like you try to fucking step up on somebody else's back to make
yourself look a bit better hmm you know that's why like at the bottom of the prison hierarchy
you got like the snitches you know the chomos you know in the rapists and you know all of us
solid cons we're better than these motherfuckers yeah so we if we find out about and we beat the
shit out of them and check them in the hole to make ourselves feel good right you know so it's
it's just like it's it's the whole thing i mean it's just prison is like fucking like negativity
what are the prison guards like are there any prison guards who are happy with what they're doing
are there any of them there to make a difference and then enjoy them so enjoy their jobs or are
they just there no i wouldn't say that you got you got the majority of prison guards or i mean
they're pretty laid back man they they'll tell you straight up they'll be like man just let me do
my eight hours you know i don't care what you do just you know don't kill nobody you know i'm saying
don't be the fuck out of nobody don't make me do no paperwork make their job you know so that's like
nine out of ten or like that and then you got like the one out of ten is like the super cop
like he wants to go above and beyond yeah and bust you for fucking petty shit you know but a lot
of them like a lot a lot of the blocks like look tattooing is illegal you can't tattoo but a lot
of content they don't give a fuck they'll walk right by check out the fucking tattoos and everything
they don't give a fuck you know i'm saying a lot of times like even like uh like in there they
they call politics so it's like you know any drama or any type of situations you know they call
politics so you know like uh you know like if you're a white boy and you do something fucking
stupid and then the other white boys we got a fucking you know set you straight you know which
means we might have to take you in a cell and whoop your fucking ass you know especially if you did
something stupid with some other races because in the other races they come to the white boy
shot car or the white boy car and what i mean the white boy car that's like the group of white
dudes they call it a car so they come you know to the leader of the white boy car and they're like
oh man you got a fucking you know discipline your dude you know he stepped out of line he did this
you know so then and what they do you do like a white dude will punish another white dude
just to like avert a race riot right you know because then they'll be like okay yeah we punished
you know he stepped out of line he did something stupid or you know whatever you know maybe some
you know stupid new dude in prison you know fucking use the n word or something in front of
a bunch of black dudes and they're like you know the dudes aren't putting up with that shit right
you know i'm saying there they'll be ready to fucking beat the fuck out of you but you know
that's that's like the rules like not in all prisons i mean some prisons like county jail
it's not that but when you're like on a prison yard it's like the rules like you know like
one race don't doesn't put their hands on another race because that can cause a race riot right
you know because like like if a black dude beats up a spanish dude even if it's a one-on-one
fire it was fair and everything or whatever then all the spanish dudes are gonna be out on the
fucking yard dude it's gonna be fucking they're gonna be ready you know they're gonna be ready to
fucking go to war you know with shanks and fucking locks and socks and
you know fucking cans of fucking tuna and fucking you know fucking socks locks on fucking belts
yep you know shit can get crazy in there like real quick so i mean a lot of times you just do
stuff you know like i'll give you a situation like i told this i've told this story to a lot of people
like maybe like we're in prison like you're in my cell you're like we're cool we're friends like
we kick it we talk shit we play whatever we joke around you know in the cell when it's just me and
you right but then you know we go out to the yard and like you know we're around this dude he's like
fucking Aryan circle you know we're around fucking this dude he's like a dirty white boy you know
we're around this dude he's like the leader of the fucking southern boys you know and then you
know and then you want to fucking try to play or say something fly you know to make yourself look good
you know to make yourself like you got one up on me or something you know in front of these guys
and maybe like when we're in the cell you're my friend so i don't say shit i'm like okay whatever
dude cool shut the fuck up you know what i'm saying but you want to say that in front of
other people and then i got a fucking you know i don't even say nothing i just fucking punch you
in your fucking mouth you know because you can't make me look bad in front of these other people
that's gonna like take my fucking respect from them you know what i'm saying yeah and then you're
gonna fucking tell me in the later you're gonna in the cell you're gonna be like what the fuck dude
would you punch me in the mouth and be like dude because you do some stupid shit you can't jump
out there he's like why say that shouldn't sell okay yeah that's in the cell dude me and you we're
cool but you don't say that should in front of these fucking dudes because then they're gonna take
that as a chink in my fucking armor and then my word isn't gonna be shit you know what i'm saying
so you know that's just that's like politics that's right right so 21 years total he said
yeah 21 years yeah how did that change you when you got out did it did it
i mean she's a different person i mean it made me who i am today i mean basically um
yeah i would say it changed me i mean i would say like when i came in i mean i grew up in the
suburbs man so um i mean i've never been a violent person i mean i was i was never like a violent
or malicious person you know i never like to get in fights you know but i mean now i mean
like i'm still not a violent person but i can get violent if i need to get violent you know
like i i tell people all the time look i'm too old to fight but i'm definitely too old to lose a
fight you know i'm saying so like like look and i don't want to have no problem with anybody
you know i'm gonna try to walk away whatever but if a motherfucker shows you
that you can't walk away dude i'm just gonna get i'm gonna get as violent as possible as quick as
possible and i'm gonna inflict as much damage as i can with no warning and then i'm just gonna leave
it alone i'm gonna i'm gonna bounce you know i'm saying that's how you got to deal with situations
like that you know i'm saying like you know i'm not a malicious person so a malicious person
they might do that and get you down and keep trying to fuck you up you know that's like a
malicious evil person they get off on shit like that and there's a lot of people like that i've
seen people like that but you know me myself i've learned if there's a situation like that
you just got inflict as much damage as you can you don't let anybody know it's coming
and then like i say then you know it's it's it's like the uh fight or flight a lot of times if you
do something real quick you can like shock a person and then while they're shocked you know laying on
the floor or their face is bloody their nose is broken then you just fucking you know out here you
bounce i mean in prison obviously you can't bounce there's a fishbowl you know but you know
still i went with the same premise in there like when i was in there if there was some
type of beef i would just handle it right there i didn't care where i didn't care if we're in the
chow hall i didn't care if staff's around if you disrespect me or you did something i would
handle it right then in there i wouldn't ask any questions and then you know it's it's just better
because then like if something you know because in there like stuff people at stuff festers and
it'll be like a beef between two people and then it turns into this big thing you know with all
these other people involved and then you might have to end up stabbing somebody or something
yeah it's messy fast yeah so you know i've always you know i learned in there you know
handle your business handle it right there you know just do it quickly and get it over with
you know what i'm saying and then like i say man i've got a fight so i mean you know like i say
it's not like i'm some tough dude i've fucking you know my nose been broken five times you know
i'm saying my shit got split right here my shit got split right here and my shit got split right
here so you know i mean if you fight you're gonna take some losses you know i'm saying yeah nobody
fucking gotta take your lumps you know whatever but you know you just keep it moving you don't make
it too serious you know or you don't like you know just because somebody beats your ass now you
got to go fucking stab them i mean that's fucking stupid yeah you know so what are you doing now
so now that you're out you're uh you're working on a new a new project yeah so um
you know i started writing books in prison yeah how many books did you write 22 22 books while you
were locked up yeah wow gangster books all gangsters nonfiction true crime mostly african-american
gangsters you know i wrote some prison stuff too but uh yeah i started journalism career you know i
mean that's basically i do true crime i do uh like prison gangs you know i've done a lot of features
for like vice penthouse a lot of foreign magazines real crime in uk you know in australia but all
like prison gangs uh mafia stuff um you know like like african-american drug lords you know mostly
like from the 80s from the crack era you know kind of the ones that were lionized in the uh
you know the annals of hip hop lore you know like especially gangster rap like in the mid 90s so i
mean i was actually locked out with a lot of these dudes but um i didn't i was just like when i was in
prison right i was like i started taking college classes you know and when you take college classes
in there i was taking correspondence mostly and you can go two routes it's like business administration
or kind of like writing you know that's the only thing that's offered it's real limited so um
i was just trying to do something for my future you know so i started uh taking college classes um
i got a a degree i got a b a degree and i got a master's degree wow you know and you get a master's
degree in humanities okay so all my stuff's like liberal arts humanities and like i say i didn't
this for me it was like uh uh this was like a 17 year process you know i didn't not like you know
it's not the typical college you know i got these degrees over 17 years i started in 93 i got my
master's degree in 2010 you know i was taking like you know sometimes like 9 12 credits a year
because it's correspondence courses so you got like nine months to do them you know so um i focused
really heavily on the writing and then uh i started writing these stories you know i i was always
real athletic i played a lot of sports a lot of times i'd be the only white dude you know running
ball with all the black dudes i'd be the only white dude playing soccer with all the mexicans
you know so that's kind of how i did my time you know i played sports i did college classes
you know i worked out and then um after i was in about six or seven years i started thinking
you know like what can i do for my future you know so i started writing you know i started writing
these stories you know i started writing these books and um i mean literally like i was like the
white dude in prison that was writing books about the african-american gangsters so you know think
about that just on the face of it after everything i've already described to you you know just to
tell you you know because i have relationships with you because i played sports and i played ball
with them but you know after i'd been in a while they knew what type of dude i was in and i you know
i started writing these books you know and uh you know when you write books in there it's like i always
tell people like uh like you hear people on the media all the time or they write books and you
know they're oh they misquoted me like you can't you can't afford to misquote anybody in there
especially if you're a white dude writing books about african-american dudes i mean you could
just imagine yeah it's not gonna look good you could just imagine but um you know but i i i
walked that path you know i i navigated that path you know i i i got that respect and really the
books i wrote were books that i wanted to read you know what i'm saying because when i first got
locked up i i i was locked up on the east coast for a lot a lot of mafia dudes so i fucking read
all the mafia books i was locked up with a lot of columbian cocaine cartel dudes i read all the
columbian cocaine cartel dudes and then like in the mid 90s when like the gangster rap is like
jumping off you know now i'm playing ball with a lot of these dudes and you know i'm a hip hop
hip hop kid too you know you know i grew up in the 80s so you know that's when hip hop started so
you know i was around you know i've been a hip hop fan since 1983 when it first came out you know
when i first learned about it but uh i would watch you know i'd be one of the only white dudes
like watching you know like these gangster rap videos and i would hear the dudes you know they
would like talk about these dudes you know the rappers and then the guys like from new york or
the guys from that area they would start talking about them and i'd be like you know i was like
intrigued and uh you know so i was like looking for books you know i'm calling my mom and my girl
i'm like order me books on these and there's like there's no books and then you know i'd ask about
these guys more like these street legends you know from the hood and um and they'd be like oh yeah that
dude's on b block and i'd be like what so that's how i first started writing because i started going
to these guys and i started saying hey man like let me tell your story yeah let me interview you
you know and um so all this
it was i wrote books that i wanted to read but at the same time i was looking for a future for
myself you know in my end goal i knew i was getting out i mean i had 25 years but you know i was
young i was 22 so i knew i was getting out i knew i had a future it wasn't like i had life
you know or it wasn't like i was went in when i was 40 or 50 and had 30 years you know i knew
i was getting out i'd still you know have my health i'd still you know be young enough to have a career
you know so um my end game my end game the whole time was film
you know i mean i wanted to make film i just couldn't make film because i was in prison
you know what i'm saying so i wrote books you know and i wrote i wrote books you know i always
think my writing has always kind of been on the cutting edge but i also think my writing to it um
it's changed because like when i first started writing i was taking these african-american
gangsters and i was i was writing about them like you know like billy the kid jesse james type figures
you know and then as i got older and i matured more and and i kind of saw how the system was
you know kind of a lot of some of the stuff we've talked about you know my views on the on the system
and the war on drugs and and law enforcement and you know the uh you know criminal judiciary system
or whatnot um i started seeing things different so my writing kind of changed to more like
advocacy type of stuff you know from this you know romanticizing or glorifying you know
gangsterism so you know but i think everybody you know as you get older you can kind of change
and you start to see things different and maybe you know what was cool to you at 25 might not be
cool to you at 40 so um you know my writing kind of changed but um like still the whole time man
i'm writing these books and in in my head i'm like man
i'm gonna when i get out i'm gonna make film i'm gonna do film this is what i want to do because
to me as a writer film is like like that's like the ultimate evolution you know as a as a writer
that's like the ultimate in game like you know if you're a writer you know to to actually become
like a director of like a film and shape this visual thing because visual stuff just has such a
much bigger impact you know than written words you know i mean more people are going to watch
movie or a documentary they're going to read a book i mean that's just a given you know what i'm
saying i mean because it's shorter it doesn't take as long you know people don't have the tension
spans or whatever so um yeah i got out 2015 i had all these books i started at the publishing house
guerrilla convict while i was in prison um i became like an uh you know basically i was doing columns
for vice you know like all in the early 2000s um i had a column called i'm busted you know about
prison stuff i was writing for all these other places and um yeah i just kind of built and then
then when i got out you know i had this idea i was like man i want to make film so i actually went
to this foray for almost like five years where i became like this national uh true crime journalist
you know just because uh i mean they just pay me good money so i was just running with it
you know like right out of prison now i was making pretty good money and they were flying
me all these different places like dude like like you know when apple has like those big
unveiling events yeah i've been flown to those twice just because i was like a national journalist
for vice you know like i've covered like sundance you know i've like covered all these fucking things
vice pay you pretty good yeah yeah they pay pretty good do they what did they pay if you don't want
i did like uh i was getting like five hundred dollars for like 1200 words oh really back in the
2000s early 2000s um no i didn't get out till 2015 oh this was after you got out yeah when i
know back when i was in prison i was getting paid like 350 oh okay 350 for about 900 a thousand words
that was like my column i was getting 350 okay so you know i was getting like 350 a month for a
monthly column like you get 350 dollars in prison you kind of like live like a king yeah you're doing
good yeah so you know but then i got out you know it's crazy to hear all those stories about those uh
those vice reporters and producers that don't make shit yeah well i'm saying i mean before they sold
out and the big scheme of things i mean you know 350 to 500 dollars a piece is is kind of chump
change you know and especially you know vice is notorious for uh being low-budgeted on film stuff
you know like we're something like a any or history might have like a 250 000 budget for like
you know like something like i was a teenage felon you know the budget might be like
like on a any or history it might be like a couple hundred thousand like those budgets were
like probably where their whole thing is they're they're a cool company were well back in the day
maybe still a little bit now they weren't cool so people wanted to work for them for free like it
looks it looks cool if you had advice on your resume so they could pay you nothing well plus what
they do i i think a lot of uh industry stuff does that i mean they get young kids when they come out
of college when they can pay him nothing before they prove themselves right you know i'm saying and
pay him yeah for sure yeah pay him 35 000 a year you know to work 10 hours a day i mean in the in
the media industry so i mean i think i mean it's a little bit of exploitation but i mean i guess
that's capitalism you know especially the media industry yeah but uh it's better than college too
honestly when you do that when you learn so much more when you actually go to work for a real company
that you do when you're in college like what the fuck was i doing in college this whole time i mean
dude i wrote stuff for free while i was in prison i mean i do i got a ton of stuff that's never even
been published like wow i was learning how to write crafting my trade so i mean you know if you
got a passion for something you can get paid for it's all good yeah for sure you know but yeah
i mean it could be a exploitive angle too you know i mean you should always pay people what they uh
you know are worth or what they deserve but um yeah i got out i had the goal to make film
i actually i mean right when i got out i made this little uh this short series it's called
easter bunny assassin like it's on youtube you know i never really took off i think maybe got like
you know 20 000 30 000 views now but i made that like right it's like a little fictional thing i had
like this little character called the easter bunny assassin you know like a dude in a james bond outfit
with a bunny head and he was going around like whacking people and uh like other holiday crime
figures you know like he whacked uh santa claus santa claus crack dealer uh there was jesus christ
junkie you know and tooth fairy mafia don so this was like a little kind of thing that i envisioned
in prison and i got out and that was kind of how i learned that was like my first foray into film i
just got like some uh you know i convinced some local college students that were you know in film
school i'm like hey let's go shoot this you know i bought some cameras and bought some equipment
they were like fuck it let's do it so that was yeah that was kind of almost like my my training
my first training but then um it's on youtube now yeah it's on you can watch it easter bunny
assassin yeah easter bunny assassin a lot to check that out it's kind of like some it's like some low
budget gorilla hey yeah i think like we made the whole thing for like like $2,000 that was just
like the food and the batteries yeah for the camera for sure and the uh the media but um
then you know i i really got lucky when i got involved with white boy you know the
documentaries on netflix now that i wrote and produced um i interviewed this director
Sean wreck he did this film called uh murder in the park it was on showtime you know it was
about a wrongful conviction and Sean wreck had actually cut his teeth uh he did like 200 crime
stopper shows for all the networks and then you know this is like 2000 whatever 16 when i first
came into contact with him like right when true crime is like blown up right after uh you know
making a murder so um he does this murder in the park it's on showtime it gets named time magazine
names at like top 15 you know true crime documentary for the year so i interviewed him for vice
and actually for whatever reason vice ended up killing the piece so the piece never ran
but i i struck up a relationship with him and he had just finished that film and he was actually
looking you know for his second film so we started talking and he found out about my background
you know he was a true crime dude so you know mostly a lot of people that are into true crime
they're gonna like my backstory you know what i'm saying so we started talking and and he was also uh
you know he was amazed at all the work all the writing i'd done he was like whoa man that's crazy
you did 21 years and you did all this stuff so um he flew me up to cleveland and he basically he's
like man uh you know because i told him you know i wasn't shy i told him i wanted to make film
you know i told him i did that little easter bunny assassin thing for what it was worth
but i said you know i wanted to make docs i saw myself you know doing true crime and
eventually features and stuff like that so he flew me up there and we started talking about ideas
you know like he was like well what ideas you have so i was throwing different ideas at him
you know about like some prison related stuff or you know i think at this time i was like on really
this uh exposing the prison thing you know because i was just out so i wanted to do this
documentary that exposed all the evils of the prison industry so that was like my big thing
that i was pitching to him but he was kind of like well i don't know and then um you know then i just
casually mentioned you know that i'd wrote all these articles on the guy white boy rick for vice
you know for trying to get him out saying that he should be out and um that struck his interest
because he knew that they had this hollywood movie with Matthew McConaughey that he was
just going into production called white boy rick you know about the same story so he found out
i knew white boy you know he found out you know i had the foundations of the story from these
articles you know i'd written for like the fix and vice and vice news so uh he was basically like
you know let's do this you know and and i kind of made a deal with him i was like look um
um i go i want you to basically you know mentor me on this film you know because i knew how to
tell a story you know i wrote books but i didn't know how to make a film i didn't know the nuts
and bolts you know how everything went and when i walked in this dude's office too i saw uh
he had nine Emmys you know in his office not national but regional Emmys that he'd won for all
those crime stopper shows all like Ohio Emmys you know and i was like okay this dude must know what
the fuck he's doing so you know we made a deal and he said you know so he all the shoots like he
would fly me in you know he would involve me in the editing process and really you know he taught
me he taught me uh you know how to make a film you know a documentary film and this i mean this
dude is a is a really good filmmaker so um we made white boy you know i i wrote and produced that
and i learned from him i appear in that too you know as a talking head and uh that was like kind of
my initial foray into film and that actually came out man that actually came out on stars
like around 2018 really yeah and it was weird because i knew it was a real good movie i knew
this movie it was this crazy story but i i don't know it never kind of took off and i don't maybe
it was because when the the white boy rick hollywood movie came out i think it kind of bombed yeah
you know what i'm saying so maybe you know just whatever the circumstances yeah and and our doc
kind of came out around the same time so maybe we got buried because of that movie and it bombed
so nobody had an interest so right so we were actually on stars for like almost like two years
and you know people knew it was cool i had a documentary on stars but it was you know i had
other projects that you know i wanted to get off but i wasn't getting any interest you know nobody
was interested in funding any of my projects and then um yeah and then like crazy shit happened
like you know the pandemic uh you know the riots you know the black lives matters going national
people talking about you know police brutality and police corruption all over the world uh
you know i just think the pandemic really slowed everything down in this country you know because
before i think when it first came out like 2018 it's like just a rat race everybody's
trying to get money capitalism they're not really i don't think people were open or receptive to the
story that we show in white boy rick because it the level corruptions are like so fucking crazy
i don't think people believed it so they just dismissed it but then you know after the pandemic
and everything that happened you know that i just mentioned through the pandemic and
you know the last uh couple years of trump which were pretty chaotic and like i say i'm not
i'm not pro trump or you know against trump you know really i don't like biden biden is the one
who may built all the fucking prisons you know him and clinton but you know i'm not i i try not to
you know get politically involved but i mean i i think anybody would say the last two years of
trump were uh pretty chaotic in this country yeah you know at least in the media i don't know but
so i think all those things that happened that i just described kind of made people more receptive
to what white boys about in the level police corruption that we're talking about
so then when it went on netflix you know it went off stars and we signed a new streaming deal with
netflix and it went on netflix in april you know right at the i guess the end of the pandemic i don't
know maybe the pandemic is still going april this year yeah and um yeah dude it went on there and it
was like it was a brand new movie dude it blew up it was like the first two weeks it was on it was
like top 10 really and it wasn't like it wasn't like top 10 documentaries it was like top 10 on
the whole site for like movies series everything for two weeks straight right and then uh like they
said in april in may like it had 20 million views man like it just fucking exploded so i don't know
it's weird how things happen because everything that's happening to me now like film wise i was
ready for this shit to happen like in 2018 i really thought it was gonna happen in 2018
but for whatever reason it didn't happen but um you know so i had like this whatever like almost
three-year fucking delay of my fucking film career not to say i was still trying to make
sure it happened but um now it's hard to make shit happen in that in that whole world the whole
film industry yeah i mean it is i know i've been battling man i've been trying to make
shit happen but uh you know now since i got the recognition from white boy and white boy blew up
it's just made people are way more receptive to my ideas because um i tell people i equate it to like
you know like when the new england patriots win the super bowl all right everybody knows
tom brady's like the main dude right but then you see like all the support players
sign these big contracts with other teams right so it's like the same like white boy like i'm not
the main person on white boy shan rec was the main person on white boy you know the editor brandy
kimmer he was the second main person on white boy you know so if anything and there's this other
producer scott burnstein so maybe me and him might be like the third fourth you know fourth
third whatever you know so you know i contributed to it you know and i helped shaped it and and you
know the the story the origin came to me the access came from me you know but um you know i was a
supporting player on this documentary i'm not going to steal credit from anybody else you know i'm
saying they deserve their credit for making a real good film but you know i helped to make this film
i was a part of it so it's now like uh i got that recognition and so it's like people think like you
know i'm i'm a part of that magic so maybe i have that magic yeah you know i'm saying so it's weird
because i always tell people like i'm the same person like i haven't really changed but it's like
the way people look at me has changed because of that film getting 20 million views in two months on
netflix you know what i'm saying yeah it was it was weird because i i i started growing sundance
about four years ago and um i started meeting some people in sundance and i met all these like
amazing talented filmmakers and they got their films in sundance and they got their films in
cans and tribeca and sw sx and i'm just like i'm like fuck like this is what i want to do
you know and um white boy blew up and like none of these dudes have like a top 10 film on netflix
and they're like calling me they're asking me like like what's the secret how did i do it and i'm like
you know it's just it was like this shift you know so it's weird man i mean i'm still dealing
with it now you know i mean i'm getting used to it but you know so i've got a funding for a lot
of my different projects so um i got this film nightlife it's a it's about um the violence in
north city you know that's about to come out you know i follow this dude around north city like we're
the worst parts of st louis we followed him around with cameras for three years he's basically a
violence interrupter this he's a he's a preacher named uh reverend kenneth mccoy we followed him
around from like 10 p.m to 1 a.m in the morning on thursday friday saturday nights like with all
the drug addicts that you know the pimps the prostitutes you know the the drug dealers the gang
bangers you know the homeless people you know that's what he does that he administers to these
people you know these are these are his flock you know he takes out sandwiches so i followed
him i followed him with a three camera team really yeah yeah it was crazy like gunshots people
threatened to steal our cameras and smash our cameras and threaten us holy shit i bet that was
wild it was wild so that doc's almost ready hell yeah where are you gonna release that
documentary documentary well i just took it to a sales agent and i'm thinking maybe a film festival
too so you know okay so yeah i don't i don't have you know i always tell people like you hear a lot
of people say oh it's gonna be on netflix i mean unless you have some unless you're like martin's
corsese and you have like some overall deal with netflix you can't say where the shit's gonna end up
you know i i do shit independently you know i'm saying i i work with private investors they
give me money and i do stuff on spec when then i when i finish it then i go to sales agent
and they try to sell it right you know so uh that's that's where i'm at right now so i got that night
life program project i got this uh project i'm i'm calling uh it's a lsd trade project uh i'm calling
it uh the psychedelic revolution right now it's about the history of the lsd trade you know the
underground chemists you know um how they locked up and targeted all the people for lsd like myself
in in the 80s and 90s and put us in prison for a long time and how now we've almost gone 360 and
they're talking about legalizing psychedelics and decriminalizing it so that's what that that's my lsd
doc i'm working on i got a humble county doc i'm working on you know that it tells the history of
humble county and the emerald triangle and how these people up in the mountains of northern
california became known for growing the best marijuana in the world and at one time in the
80s and 90s supplied 60 percent of the domestic product in the u.s you know then it um it tells
how like you know how like they were terrorized and where they lived was basically militarized
with like helicopters and the military going in you know and arresting them and throw them in jail
and you know cutting down their crops and then you know it it goes full circle to like you know
i was locked up with some of these guys from humble county and now they're out now and they
have legal farms you know yeah and yeah so you would think it's all good you know these guys
they're legal now but now you know with big ag and big pharma coming in the the marijuana game
in california you know a lot of these guys are small farmers you know that these guys are up in
the mountains they're small farms you know they they only got you know so many spots and like down
in southern california you know in santa rosa they have these big green houses you know with
these massive operations and and uh these guys are struggling so you know that's what that
films is about it's about the history of humble county it's about the emerald triangle it's about
why they grow the best marijuana in the world uh why they should be considered like the napavala
napia valley of cannabis but you know it's also about the problems that they're facing right now
in the market in california and how a lot of these farmers like
the cops couldn't make them stop growing weed the war on drugs couldn't make them stop growing
weed you know that the droughts and the fires couldn't make them start growing weed but now
a lot of them might have to stop growing weed they might give up because you know big ag because
they're taking over the market and they're driving the price down yeah they can't make no money
so that's my humble county doc so that's my lsd doc i got my cannabis doc i got an ecstasy doc
that is um it's about this crew out of atlanta called the southside boys that were like these huge
are these huge ecstasy suppliers they were important from amsterdam they were supplying like you know
all lana all the southwest down here in florida one of their big hubs was panama city and one of
one of their stomping grounds was the club uh the club uh the the club la vila you know which is
famous club in panama city it's like the world's biggest nightclub it's closed now it's like it's
like where they had uh you know like mtv used to film there and a lot of the the wcw nitro and
stuff like that and i think like girls gone wild but um so i'm doing that on the that extra
ring called the southside the southside boys and then uh i'm working on this other project
it's called doteman it's basically about america's first drug cartel and it goes all the way back to
the 20s and it looks at like you know when the mafia started the international global drug trade
you know because in pop culture you know in a lot of movies there's this thing like the mafia says
like oh like we don't fuck with heroin but i mean they they they were the first drug cartel you know
they heroin has been their biggest money makers since you know before prohibition ended so that i
got that story too so that goes all the way back so that's kind of like uh you know the projects
i'm hoping to get all these projects out like within the next uh 12 to 18 months god damn seth
that's a lot of projects hey you're on it man you are a busy dude i don't know if we're going to
find an answer to this uh the prison industrial complex in this country but uh if anyone can shine
light on it it's probably you yeah i don't know man i just saw i my biggest thing now is um
let all the nonviolent weed people out man i mean they're still like from the numbers i've read
they're still like 40 000 people locked up nonviolent for cannabis let them out man
you know what i'm saying you got people making millions of dollars man yeah you know so let
these people out like i said i've been in prison any reasonable person will agree there's people
in prison that belong in prison and like i say i don't hate law enforcement you know that's their
job lock up those violent people they don't deserve to be out here if you you know whatever
sometimes you might do something violent and you know you learn your lesson and you know you're
okay and you assimilate but these people that are repeat violent offenders put them in prison man
that's where they deserve man this is like fucking polite society you shouldn't have to be walking
around you know thinking someone's gonna threaten you or fucking whip you with a gun or shoot you
or take your shit you know what i'm saying right that's not what this world is about that's not what
america is about but you know so those people belong in prison but you know all these nonviolent
drug offenders especially the marijuana guys i mean let them out man lock up the serial killers
lock up the chomos legalize all drugs and we'll all be fine i mean shit you know what i'm saying
