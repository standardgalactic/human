Jason Giorgiani, thank you so much for joining me on the podcast man, appreciate it.
Thank you for the invitation Danny, it's a pleasure to be here.
For people listening, can you give just a brief background on yourself and your history
and philosophy and everything that you've studied and written about?
Sure, so I'm a native New Yorker and I did my BA and my MA at New York University and
then I completed my doctorate in philosophy at the State University of New York online
island and then I spent a number of years teaching at a bunch of different colleges
in New York and New Jersey area, greater Gotham as I like to call it and I taught philosophy,
history of philosophy, ethics, comparative religion, political theory at one point and
also the history of Iran and in philosophy, often my focus was philosophy of science and
technology and its relationship to society, so STS, science, technology and society.
So it's a wide range of areas that I taught in before then getting involved in some very
unusual political machinations, which ultimately led to me being in the pages of the New York
Times and Newsweek and so forth, which we can talk about.
Yeah, what was all that about?
It seems like there was some sort of a campaign against you to smear you or discredit you that
ended up on the front page but in the New York Times and inside of a bunch of different
publications and somehow the MI6 was involved in this?
Yeah, it's a long story but I think actually it's an interesting one and we have time,
so I'll unpack it for you.
So I had written this doctoral dissertation Prometheus and Atlas in 2012 and received
my doctorate for it in 2013.
Then the book was expanded and published in 2016, right?
So my first book Prometheus and Atlas, which by the way it won the book award of the Parapsychological
Association in 2016 and this is relevant to the story I'm about to unfold for you because
right after that book came out, in the rather I would say meteoric fashion became very well
connected in the parapsychology community among very serious researchers like people
at the Society for Scientific Exploration of which I became a member and people at the
Parapsychological Association.
A lot of the folks that you've interviewed are connected to those same people and we're
talking like Russell Targ who I got to meet there at one of the PA conferences and Hal
Putoff of course is a prominent member of the Society for Scientific Exploration.
So I became well connected in those circles and Prometheus and Atlas was hailed in those
circles as one of the most important or if not the most important parapsychological treatise
for a long time even though I was coming at parapsychological data from the standpoint
of a philosopher who was interested in the deeper conceptual implications of these things.
So point being I'm very connected to these people and in a way that I think is also going
to wind up being relevant a lot of these same people wound up central to the UFO disclosure
movement as it has now you know begun to unfold and this is the milieu in my life when in
my book is published in February and then in about I would say May or June of 2016 this guy
from London reaches out to me and he says I kid you not he is the British head the head of the
British branch of the Vril Society. Now the Vril Society were supposedly these occultists
who created the National Socialist German Workers Party the Nazi Party.
They were like these barons and aristocrats in Austria and Germany actually mostly based
originally in Austria remember Hitler was from Austria and in Germany and Baron Sabatendorf
and his associates created this occult circle that had these female mediums involved with it
Maria Orsic and others and they claimed to be channeling messages from you know entities okay
and believe it or not these people created the Nazi Party as a pack as a political action
committee in order to fight the rise of communism in Germany remember Marx was a German and even
though the you know the Soviet Union became the first bastion of communism communism was born
in Germany and there was already a very strong communist contingent in the Weimar Republic
and these these aristocrats occultists were not interested in seeing communism seize political
power in Germany so they they created this political front the Nazi Party and hired somebody
like Hitler was good orator to basically defend their interests defend the interests of the
aristocracy and so the occultism of of Nazism really is something that is brought in from the
ground up okay as these people are setting up this society so anyway that's to give you a
background what's the real society and this guy reaches out to me he goes the real society is
basically like a modern spinoff of what was happening no no no i mean that's what they called it
back then that's what they called it back then so still active it's still alive today some people
say it was called the thula gazelle shaft the thul society thul is the germanic concept for
atlantis the germanic equivalent of atlantis so some people say it was called thula gazelle
shaft for atlantis society and that it was organ organized around the idea of real and
some people say that the thul society spun off into the real society in any case it was this
thing back then and this guy contacts me and he says i'm the head of the british branch of the
real society now to put that in context for you there were a lot of people at a high level in
the british parliament in the house of lords and so forth even in the early 1940s who wanted to make
not just a detente with hitler but an alliance with the nazis and um actually you know hitler made
like three peace offers to these people to try to solicit the british empire to come into some kind
of strategic alliance with him so point being that there would be a british branch of the real
society is not completely bizarre it's conceivable but it's strained credulity for me somewhat that
in whatever 2016 some guy is calling me or kind writing me and saying this anyway i dismissed
the guy he sounded like a nutcase and i had come out with this book which although it's a very
serious philosophical text from ethos and atlas goes into all kinds of paranormal phenomena and
in the last chapter also engages with ufo phenomenon and i had been getting kind of
crank emails from a lot of people so i dismissed the guy then i got involved at the same time
with a very high level uh iranian opposition group so i'm persian by paternal descent
and for a long time since at least i would say at least in a serious way since 2009
when there was that green uprising in iran at least since 2009 i had been involved in a
serious way in the iranian opposition to the islamic republic to try to you know remove
this regime from power and to develop a form of government that would reflect the will of the
iranian people so i get involved with this very high level um sociopolitical group devoted to
a cultural and political revolution in iran not just regime change but a cultural revolution in
iran and then once i'm involved with them this guy contacts me again and he says to me
we have um a broadcast facility in croatia where we can bombard the islamic republic
with whatever anti-regime propaganda you want to tailor for this purpose and there's a guy in
washington michael bagley who runs a private intelligence agency called jellyfish and they're
they're the ones managing this dish in croatia which can bombard you know the islamic republic
with whatever kind of message you want to get into the country and i said all right look let me
just google this character right and i googled them and there was a story from mother jones and a
story that had been run in wired about jellyfish which was presenting the organization as the
salvaged intelligence directorate of blackwater you remember what blackwater was the eric prince
right yep okay so what happened was blackwater fell apart and eric prince was he he became
increasingly dissatisfied with the kinds of people that were around him and the kinds of people
that he had to deal with within the us deep state and the intelligence community i think he came to
feel that his efforts to bring security to iraq were being undermined by people in the broader
intelligence community and so he sort of left um what had been blackwater and the organization
disintegrated that was of course a mercenary organization right but it had an in-house
intelligence service and jellyfish was a rebranded form of blackwater's intelligence service it's
in-house intelligence and michael had worked as eric prince's like intelligence director
this guy michael bagley okay so this creepy crazy guy in london tells me call michael bagley
and he will be able to help you with these regime change efforts in iran so i said fine
with one phone call i'll figure out whether this guy is a crank or whether there's something to this
and i called and the guy was expecting my call we had a nice conversation yeah
and we had a couple meetings over the course of a few months we had a lot of correspondence
and a couple of meetings in person and so so basically this guy in london jonathan got me
involved with the former intelligence director of blackwater through my interest in bringing about
regime change in iran because he failed with this whole bizarre drill society angle right right
but then over the course of my much more tangible involvement with michael and jellyfish
in terms of iran regime change he brought back he brought this weird stuff back into the conversation
the nazi stuff weird stuff related to that like for example we had been discussing this privately
my interaction with joc valet so at one point jonathan tells me that and by the way let me
just preface this this is kind of out of the order of the story but it's worth mentioning up front
so that people get it more of a sense of who it was i was dealing with when this whole fiasco
wound up ending with my defamation in the pages of the new york times and newsweek and stories on
nbc and so forth i dug into who this character was this london er jonathan yeah and this guy
has been initiated into more than a handful of the top secret societies in the world he was like a
32nd or 33rd degree mason he belonged to all kinds of you know like rose accrucian golden dawn
orders and all over the world from argentina to various countries in europe what also
look i was working to try to bring about regime change in iran right right so i had a little bit
of involvement with people in mosad as well and oh really yeah and for the record for the record
i've never taken a single shekel from the state of israel by the way they offered me money and i
was so insulted that at that point i cut off communication with them but in any case i did
work closely with about four different people in mosad how did you get connected with them
it was part of the let's say lobbying efforts we were carrying out for the sake of change of regime
in iran okay during the trump administration which if you can remember at that time he had
well mike pence had since 2009 in in the congress mike pence had been a very outspoken
advocate for regime change in iran and then at that time john bolton was also if you remember
in the administration and he's been in iran regime change hawk so anyway we were we were carrying
out some serious lobbying in washington i went to the capital and had some meetings including
with one of the members of the national security council at at one point and anyway in that context
as you can imagine i also engage with people representing state of israel because there's no
country in the world that has more of a vested interest in seeing the regime change in iran
than israel does for a very good reason but my point is this one of these characters in mosad
had worked with jonathan before and knew knew him quite well and in the course of conversation
he inadvertently revealed to me that jonathan was a well-placed uh mi6 operative which i had
not been aware of i thought he's just like some british are who knows the head of black water
intelligence but then i find out and i found this out very late in my involvement with him
and had i known this up front i would not have been dealing with him but anyway point being so
guys and initiated into all these secret societies he's also an mi6 operative okay and he's doing
things like writing letters saying he's the head of the british branches of real society
okay so this guy so this guy at one point
he introduces me to a former nasa jpl engineer who has supposedly schematics
for a retrofitted reverse engineered version of the nazi bell okay there was this thing called
the glocker denny i use the same trimmer for everything and now my face smells like balls
sounds like you need the bbb brother the big black it's the beard and balls bundle from
manscaped trim your troubles separately with the lawn mower 5.0 and the beard hedger a trimmer
for your moneymaker oh and another for the boys downstairs i've been using manscaped for years
now it is the best trimmer you can use for your junk okay you're not going to use the same trimmer
for your face and your balls obviously you want to keep it separate so you keep that one in the
shower like i do and when you need to clean it up and you need to look presentable for your wife
or for your significant other it's the best bang for your buck it's made to trim that sensitive
sacks skin chicken skin area down there if you catch my drift okay but are they waterproof
of course they're waterproof it all happens in the shower now and with the lawn mower 5.0 ultra
it is ruthless and honestly i spend more time than i probably should with those interchangeable
blade heads it gets super smooth down there and the beard hedger can achieve any style you want
with just a twist of the zoom wheel stop using one trimmer steve and double fist it with manscaped
beard and balls bundle and today we have a special deal for our listeners if you want to

get the premium grooming experience you deserve with manscaped back in 1943-44 in prog the ss
had set up a think tank under the direction of general Hans Kamler and they brought in a bunch of
aeronautical engineers including from italy and we can get into this if we want to you know once
we get into the disclosure conversation david grush has talked about how there was this crash in
1933 in magenta italy right right and musolini brought the germans in right away okay so this
explains why this this guy belutso was involved on the engineering team and why they put the project
not in germany but in a third party country namely you know Czechoslovakia okay right so so because
it was a joint italian-german operation they picked a third country to do it in and they had this
think tank and they built something which basically was a it was a power plant shaped like an acorn
or a bell and inside this thing were two counter-rotating cylinders one filled with
mercury and one filled with thorium which are both radioactive isotopes and apparently
when this contraption which is spinning the mercury and thorium in opposite directions
at a very high velocity when this is pulsed the right way with a combination of ac and dc power
it causes the plasma to undergo a a state change it causes the the mercury and thorium isotopes
to undergo a state change and to interact with each other in a way that opens up a controlled
vortex so just the way that like you can take you know uranium or plutonium right and under the
care very carefully calibrated extremely precise explosive force you can get that
that material the yellow cake uranium to enter into a state of fusion nuclear fusion
the mercury and the thorium isotopes inside this bell device will undergo a state change
which then puts out more energy than you're putting into the system okay right so like
with nuclear technology yeah you can either create an uncontrolled
an uncontrolled fission reaction or you can control the nuclear reaction to have a power plant
that you get like calibrated energy from out of and this bell was like that it was something that
could generate power and be a source basically a free energy in the sense that you're getting
more energy out of it than you're putting into it okay real quick what year is this again
43 to 44 no no when what year is this when the guy the mi6 guy or um the guy from jellyfish
introduced you to the guy from jpl it was spring of 2017 if i'm not mistaken the spring of 2017
so and who was the one who introduced you to the jpl guy um was it the jellyfish guy or was it
the guy in london mi6 guy mi6 guy so why is this mi6 operative introducing somebody who's trying to
lobby for an iranian regime change to somebody working on some ancient nazi science remember
the guy introduced himself to me as the head of the british branch of the real society and i
completely dismissed him so what i think is that when he saw me clearly i was under surveillance
by these people and when he saw me involved with iran regime change and saw that i was willing to
basically risk my life for the sake of that project which i was by the way and we can get into that
too you know the crazy lengths i went to to try to facilitate regime change in iran um he saw
that it's something that i cared about so much that he could use it to manipulate me so it wasn't
about the iran stuff that was just the way i think to get a hook into me to work try to engage him
on other things which had more to do with ufo's and parapsychology and that's okay that's my guess
of what his m o was so he introduces me to this jpl guy who's got these schematics that claim to be
an updating of this bell technology to our time right so you imagine 1940s we had computers
over the size of walls right giant transistors if you're going to build something like the bell
today it doesn't need to be that size whatever that thing was nine to 12 feet tall you could
probably put it as they claimed in a cylinder like this size and this guy had these schematics
of basically this mercury thorium reactor which was in this kind of cylindrical form and they had
clusters of them that were connected to each other that would collectively produce power and
each of them would fit inside an encased module and you could put these modules together like
each one was like a slice in a pizza pie and you could build this larger okay larger power plant
and the idea with that is that you could scale it up as much as you wanted you could use this thing to
power a car or you could use it to power an aircraft carrier and depending on how many
modules you connected to each other and he sends me okay so i had had dinner with jack valet at his
home when was it and i think i think it was late 2016 or very early 2017 and it was about my book
prometheus and atlas because he had read prometheus and atlas shortly after it came out and of course
i discussed his work in that book you know his passport to mcgonia invisible college were significant
influences on my philosophical analysis of the ufo phenomenon and it was reflected in the text of
prometheus and atlas and i think also that there were some novel ideas i had in that book about
the archetype of prometheus and how it expresses the essence of technological science as a force
in world history and how i developed that idea in the context of the philosophical work of say
martin heidegger which jack was very interested in and so he invited me to his home we had a very
nice dinner together uh and there had there was one picture of us that i had i suppose made the
mistake of posting in social media and this guy jonathan saw that photo so he became aware of the
fact that i was involved with joc valet and had some kind of access to him so then i guess late
spring 2017 or early summer he sends me with this nasa jpl guy to joc in san francisco and
i set up a meeting in the fairmont hotel actually on top of knob hill
and this guy presents these schematics to valet and he does this in the guise of valet as a
silicon valley venture capitalist saying to him basically look this is we have this
blueprint i guess you call it blueprint and we're working on a prototype and we want to try to find
venture capital for this and long story short um i was supposed to meet with uh joc again to get
his personal assessment of what this what this guy was about because frankly at this point i didn't
trust any of these people and i was starting to think that maybe i am uh being played by some kind
of you know um master manipulators of the type that valet discusses at length in his book messengers
of deception he wrote this whole book in the late 70s about intelligence agencies and basically
criminal syndicates who use the ufo phenomenon and other bizarre uh happenings in order to manipulate
people through a kind of elaborate smoke and mirrors game and i actually wanted his opinion on
whether he thought that these were the kinds of people that i was dealing with in which case i
was really thinking at that point to cut them off but anyway uh he had some kind of personal
surgery and personal issues that prevented me from regrouping with him after this meeting with the
nasa engineer the former nasa jpl engineer right so i never got to get his assessment
and then i think it was within a month later that i was defamed in the new york times
and frankly i don't blame valet for not wanting to communicate with me after that he has a very
significant reputation to maintain and here i am being accused of all kinds of nonsense
so how did you get defamed how did that happen so
okay so i'll i'll lead with that and then i'll come wrap back around to tell you another
relevant story with regard to this london ur okay um in i think it was june of 2017
i sat down with this young man in a bar uh in the shadow of the empire state building
who purported to be a right-wing youth from sweden who was who had been on assignment in britain
studying like i don't know like viking pagan groups for some thesis he was writing about
freedom of uh the suppression of freedom of expression in academia so he claimed to be
writing this thesis about how free speech is being suppressed in academia okay and that his
main subject of research were right-wing groups in europe and he had been in britain and these
guys at the london forum had uh basically written to me and begged me to meet with this guy when he
visited new york now the london forum is a kind of right-leaning think tank in london
where i had been invited in february of 2017 to come give a talk on heidegger and philosophy of
technology right and to promote my book prometheus and atlas now i guess who set up that talk for
me at the london forum in february of 2017 not jonathan yes jonathan yes and interestingly enough
interestingly enough when i went to speak at the london forum by the way there were police
helicopters around the building there was a police cordon around the building we're talking
about britain earlier off record right i mean i have never seen a police presence like this in my
life for some 25 30 right-wing people uh collected into a room presenting intellectual papers
there was such an antifa presence marshaled outside this conference hotel that they cordoned
the whole place off not just with cops on the ground but with police helicopters there were
literally chopper noises in the background of my talk on heidegger's philosophy of technology
so but here's the thing jonathan who invited me to this talk never showed he didn't come to the
conference himself and anyway i'm not going to go into the details there but point being it was
very suspicious and then and then it's these london forum guys who contact me and they say look
this young kid's coming and he's doing this dissertation thing and you know we want you to
help him out he wants to interview you and get your perspective on this subject
suppression of freedom of speech in academia so i sit down with this guy in this pub and little
do i know he's wired under his clothes okay he's wired with a camera and microphone under his clothes
is this it yeah and so he films he films two hours of footage of me two hours
and of this two hours of footage two minutes of it wind up in the new york times
right so imagine that the guy records me for two hours and the two hours of audio is spliced down
to two minutes with sentences and half sentences of mine stitched together to make it sound like
i said things that i didn't what did it what did they try to make you say so i'll give you an example
at one point i talk about how i think that if the current migration policies continue remember this
was 2017 so starting in 2014 2015 we'd seen angela merkel in germany allowing these millions of
migrants to come in through turkey from syria right and so forth yeah europe was being overrun
by migrants both from the middle east and from north africa okay and there were women in all
across germany there were there were horrendous social problems that were ensuing as a result of
this okay and so i said in that uh interview look if these policies continue like this
we're going to see a horrendous backlash a right-wing reaction and by 2050 you're going to have
alexander napoleon and hitler on european currency which is a rather rather you know melodramatic
you know statement right but it's making a point that if this kind of policy continues
for another 20 30 years right there's going to be a very extreme right-wing reaction reaction yeah
so at one point i say that at another completely different juncture in the conversation
we're discussing a potential nuclear war between india and pakistan and i say to him in that context
that we meaning the west allied with india could win that war at the cost of a few hundred million
people i have to understand india is a country with population of what like 1.2 billion something
like that right pakistan's got like i don't know a couple hundred million people right
so i'm talking about a potential nuclear war on the indian subcontinent
might be won by india at the cost of a few hundred million people so he takes that passage
at the cost of a few hundred million people and the hitler napo alexander napoleon hitler thing
and splices them together like i'm advocating for the return of nazism and calling for the
extermination of hundreds of millions of people like in europe and the west to give you one example
of the horrendous distortions so predictions were turned into prescriptions and completely unrelated
statements were stitched to one another and two hours of audio cut down to about two and a half
minutes and put right there in the new york times and then carried by newsweek and a lot of other
mainstream media and what was the purpose of this what was the what acts did they have to grind
what did they gain by doing this to you so i had been involved uh not involved i was a formative
member of what we called the alt right corporation in in 2016 the alt right you know as trump was
running for office right the alt right was this completely amorphous shitshow of various political
tendencies from libertarians to fascists frankly to uh i don't know christian evangelical type groups
there was no cohesive and coherent overarching ideology the only thing that you know bound the
so-called alternative right together was its opposition to um basically you know typical
entrenched conservatism right like the republican party united states big business typical conservatism
the only thing that bound all these groups together was that and the way i got involved with this
is that uh basically i had been looking at this political landscape and forecasting that we were
going to have the rise of a very regressive traditionalist white identity politics and i
wanted to try to make sure that the alt right did not go in that direction at the same time i was
working as i said with the iranian opposition and this is going to be a difficult one for you to wrap
your mind around and maybe also some of your listeners because people are very unfamiliar with
the socio politics of iran but iran means arian and so uh iran is like definitionally speaking the
arian nation the name of the country means that it's the cradle and homeland of the arians and so
the discourse that's rising up today against islamic fundamentalism in iran is an arian
discourse it's a discourse for the revival of the pre islamic identity of the persian people and of
other iranians but what arian means in iran is completely different from what it meant in i don't
know uh 1940s europe or 1930s europe right so what did it mean well i mean the term technically just
means noble noble and it's a self descriptor that the people in in in that land applied to themselves
right so land of the arian yeah land of the arians so so look here's the thing iran traditionally
throughout history has been the most cosmopolitan country on earth uh it's a civilization that emerged
from out of the synthesis of all kinds of different people some of them ethnically related like the
persians and the schizians and the meads who are all arians or iranians but many others you know
not ethnically related like the babelonians the assyrians the lidians iran at its very foundation
was a very sort of multi-ethnic cosmopolitan entity and it became even more so throughout the
course of history because if you look at where iran is placed geographically it's right at the
crossroads of the world it's between india china uh eurasia right and um the middle east and north
africa so it is the crossroads of the world and throughout the course of history it served as
the single greatest conduit for the cross-pollinization of various civilizations right it's how europe
influenced india and how indian influences streamed back into europe it had a fundamental impact on
chinese civilization and then when the mongols came in and conquered iran asian civilization also
impacted iranian identity so it's like this global melting pot it's the closest thing to a
civilizational melting pot that you had before the united states arose and there are a lot of
structural similarities actually jefferson was deeply influenced by uh ancient iranian
political thought when he came up with the constitution united states because he was
reading greeks like xenophon and herodotus who wrote about the structure of the persian
imperial system almond was telling me about this yeah which was a federal system anyway
and they all had tremendous reverence for syris the founder of the persian empire the father of
iran as this great humanitarian cosmopolitan humanistic statesman right so i have this whole
persian heritage and i'm involved in this iranian opposition movement which is reclaiming
area and identity but in this cosmopolitan sense all right and so i have this vision that if i can
take what was then called the european new right nouvelle droite in europe and my books uh you
know are published by the leading press arctos the leading press of the european new right
which by the way also publishes alexander dugin and i i thought to myself if i can take the european
new right and this shit show that's the emerging american alt right and i confuse it somehow with
the arian renaissance in iran then i can shift the trajectory of this whole thing away from white
nationalism and this kind of regressive traditionalist white identity politics towards something much
more progressive and cosmopolitan right okay this is what i'm thinking so when i think of alt right
and how it's portrayed in the media and how it's been portrayed in the media during trump's whole
campaign and his whole run it was mainly like an opposition against trump right it was it was a term
that was i don't know if it was hijacked or you mean a way to damage trump a way to when i think
of when you think of alt right you're thinking of like extreme right wing white nationalist
racist people right yeah so what is the actual def what is your how do you define alt right well
when i got involved with the thing the term had been defined by paul gothread who's a jew
and a libertarian okay so it had no definition if we rewind the clock back to
october of 2016 it was an amorphous phenomenon there were these white nationalists involved
right and i was concerned looking at what was happening in europe with the migrants right
that this nascent alt right in america would fuse with the worst elements in europe and that
we would see a kind of return to fascism okay and so what i wanted to do was to recalibrate the
trajectory now this london er exploited that uh interest of mine and got himself involved
with my attempt to create alliances between americans europeans and persians during that
period of time and he actually made the promise to me that his associates would bankroll the
formation of a single corporation the alt right corporation uh to fuse a number of different
entities my publisher arctus media this media outfit called red ice radio and television
and also think tank called the national policy institute which at that time richard spencer
had been running and they told me look georgiani you be the chairman of this thing and we're going
to make you a liaison to uh to the white house where you'll go in and engage with steve bannon
and try to influence trump's policies through engagement with bannon and bannon was
known to have been an avid reader of the books put out by my publisher he's interested in dugin
he sat down with dugin at one point um and he's interested in evola julius evola and other
authors that are published uh by my uh publishing house so the idea was to turn me into a person
who could um basically consolidate the european new right and the alt right and be a liaison to
the white house and the way they hooked me was to tell me that this would facilitate our efforts
at regime change in iran that was the main you know i think um angle of approach that they used
to convince me to do this but here's the thing between january of 2017 when that corporation
was formed and september of 2017 when i was defamed that funding that was promised never
materialized and they gave me excuse after excuse after they i mean jonathan's people
gave me excuse after excuse and uh jellyfish
why the funding wasn't coming through they gave me every excuse and at some point i think it was
maybe it was in the again in the spring i would say of 2017 i had had it with them and i was ready
to cut off these people and say okay well clearly they've been playing me this whole time and then
here's what they do in response to that jonathan sends me a nearly one billion dollar oil contract
the actual sum was with 800 something close to 900 million dollars for the reconstruction
of the venezuelan national oil industry so now if you rewind back to spring of what do you mean he
sent you a contract it was a i don't know it was like maybe 100 pages nearly 100 pages and the
contract outlined the reconstruction of every aspect of venezuela's national oil industry
so if you rewind back to uh may of 2017 nothing was going on in venezuela about four or five
months later there started to be major protests against the government there and what he had told
me when he sent me this contract was that we um we are going to overthrow the government of venezuela
and we need to the uk is i don't know on behalf of what entity he was speaking look we i found out
the guy was a mi6 operative but i mean we can discuss this also later in the course of our
conversation the intelligence services of countries are routinely infiltrated and i think that there
are many rogues there are many rogue elements and outfits inside certainly our intelligence
services in the united states and i'm sure also in theirs right so i don't know who this we was
exactly right but clearly they were controlling the former intelligence director of blackwater
and they had deep ties in mi6 and he said look we're going to overthrow the government of venezuela
and we need to get into the oil industry before we do that now here's the interesting thing
four five months later i forget exactly within within six months of that time okay there was
this massive revolt against maduro in venezuela yes and the way maduro put that down is he rounded
up the oil bosses so he knew the coup was coming from within the oil industry okay so this lines
up with what the guy told me but why am i telling you this my point is this that people might look
at this and say like georgiani how were you so naive to be strung along for so long by these people
well look when someone puts a nine hundred million dollar oil contract in front of you
and you know they seem to be capable of reconstructing the venezuela national oil industry
and by the way i was also told that they were behind this came out in the way i don't understand
why did they put it in front of you what was the purpose of putting it in front of you yes he was
wanted to show you like showing off no no no i knew a patrolling engineer at one of the most
prominent oil companies in the world and he said to me because here's the thing remember they had
promised me this money for the alt-right corporation capital investment okay to make me chairman of
the alt-right corporation okay money never came through so now he's saying look we'll get you the
money by some other means uh here's a few funds or something well we'll raise the funds so he said
take this contract to this oil executive that you know and if his company is willing to carry
out this project you'll get the commission on the deal okay i see you'll get the commission by the
way this patrolling engineer said to me i think probably wisely on his part he said look i don't
want any part of this money if i get a commission from this deal you can have all of it now that
would be a lot more than what they had initially been promising me as a capital investment set up
the alt-right corporation and preside over it as its chairman so point being these people
gave me reason not to dismiss them and disconnect with them and that's how they strung me along for
as long as they did interestingly enough uh my defamation came i think within less than a month
of my resigning from the alt-right corporation uh within 24 hours of charlottesville so the the
situation yeah well so the situation was my partners look here's here's the thing i was supposed
to be the chairman right but i was also supposed to bring in this money for the corporation since
i didn't bring in the money i began to be sidelined by my partners and by about well the summer of
2017 i had completely lost control of this entity it had become like a frankenstein's monster right
i lost control of it and my partners went to charlottesville and made this mess and within 24 hours
i said no no no no you know i was still involved at a high level in iranian opposition lobbying
in washington and so forth so i said no there's no way i want to be involved with this i mean
this has become a travesty and i resigned now i hardly think it's a coincidence that it's only
several weeks after my resignation that i was defamed in the new york times and that they
used a video that they they had recorded months prior to that so let me go back to the bar the
bar in the shadow of the empire state building where this young man recorded me yes i did my
digging after that and i found out that this organization that he claimed to represent hope
not hate some social justice sjw antifa type organization is actually a front for british
intelligence it was a front for mi5 domestically initially in britain and i think it's open to
branch in the united states so at this point probably it's under the jurisdiction of mi6
so point being that kid was at the very least operating at the behest of people involved
with british intelligence and when do they choose to release this video in the new york times after
they've lost me as an asset once i have resigned from the alt-right corporation so from what i'm
understanding whoever is behind this guy jonathan at the mi6 they do not want you to create some sort
of an alliance between the united states right wing europe and iran yes why what is their motivation
for wanting to throw a wrench in that plan twofold at least one on the ideological level
such a constellation of power would prevent the right wing in the west let's say in general
from going in a racist fascist direction yes that mirrors what happened in 1930s 40s europe why
because the iranian youth are not interested in some uh nazi style regime to replace the
islamic republic right they're interested in women's equal rights freedom of expression
and technological and scientific progress you probably aren't aware of this maybe a lot of
your audience isn't either iran is one of those few countries that enjoys the distinction of having
been the world leader in science and technology for 250 years no less between about let's say
900 ad and 1150 ad while europe was in the you know dark age of medievalism right uh
iran was a powerhouse of scientific research and technological innovation so you know the
persians are one of these people who have contributed tremendously to the advancement of
knowledge and to you know creative innovation on the planet and it goes back to the basic ethos
of zoroastrianism and mythrism which i don't know if we get a chance we'll get into but you know
the whole teaching of zarathustra is oriented around the progressive spirit at work in the cosmos
and what it means to be a co-creator with the divine and to uh build a more ideal future for
everybody right it's a very futuristic progressive mindset and this is what is now um overthrowing
the islamic republic not just on a political level but in terms of cultural revolution
and my thinking had been that if i could plug european and american society into the battery
that is the iranian youth then i could redirect this right wing reaction in a way that will be much
more uh futurist progressive and humanitarian got it you see got it and clearly somebody in
british intelligence doesn't want that to be the case now there's another more tangible
let's say materialistic concern why don't you think they want that to be the case
you remember how i was telling you that um in the years leading up to uh the you know the blitz
in the years leading up to the the uh the bombing of london by the nazis and so on so forth hitler
actually tried to make peace with some well-placed aristocrats in britain and they had um they had
i mean like i think it was something like a third of the house of lords or so forth that
were sympathetic to them clearly there's some kind of an elite element in britain that is aligned
with this i don't know whether you want to call it national socialist or fascist agenda
and uh who knows if you know they they control the british state but they may be a rogue element
that has a certain agenda that they want to see unfold in the world and that agenda may include
you know the rise of a very you know racist and hierarchical form of political power in the european
continent and in the west at large but i think that there's a another um aspect of this that's much
more cynical and um uh down to earth and that's that i didn't want iran to be looted when i was
involved in the opposition it became very clear to me that uh you know iran is encircled by corporate
vultures who are just waiting for this regime to collapse so that they can come in and recolonize
well colonize the country iran never was properly colonized but it came awfully close when the
british and the russians carved up the country into spheres of influence um in the early 1900s
and basically controlled all of iran's resources remember the british came in in the early 20th
century and they created something called the anglo-persian oil company which later became
british petroleum it became british petroleum after muhammad mosaddek kicked their asses out of
iran right muhammad mosaddek the democratically elected uh nationalist prime minister of iran
nationalized iran's oil in 1951 and this was a huge blow to the british in particular and that's
when the anglo-persian oil company became what we know as british petroleum today right so there's
a whole history of the exploitation of iran's resources by foreign powers and the agenda that
my colleagues and i were pursuing for regime change in iran was one that would protect iran's
national resources from this kind of foreign exploitation and i also think that they did not
want someone you know who looks the way i do and who speaks english as fluently as i do as a native
new yorker and an american to be able to be an international mouthpiece for the defense of iran's
national interests once the islamic republic were to be overthrown so that's a much more
cynical agenda that i think was also at play it's also crazy that they were able to get the new
york times did the new york times reach out to you before they published this i think maybe 18
hours beforehand 18 hours beforehand you can imagine that day for me i threatened to sue the guy i
was ranting at him on the telephone the editor of the show yeah i was like are you kidding me you
know this was a two-hour conversation like what if you print you know anyway yeah i was not happy
to say the least i got about 18 hours heads up from this guy yeah it's interesting that they
would publish something like that so quickly yeah well you know you know this danny with one source
you know the new york times newsweek nbc cb yet they all have intelligence operatives
well placed within the organizations they're controlled by their narrative is controlled
by the anglo-american deep state and so that suggests to me that one piece of evidence right
there that one data point suggests to me that actually whoever was pulling the strings in london
is part of the anglo-american establishment because they had that kind of reach with the new york
times i've had people on here that have worked with big publications like similar to the new york
times some of them actually with the new york times and they've explained their experience with
reporting on topics such as like covert ops for example that the cia deputy director has a
relationship with the editor in chief of some of these publications right and they have to when
it comes to reporting on some of these things that involve the cia they have to run it by the deputy
director or whoever it is that's their liaison at that publication and typically they won't just say
no don't run this this is false or we're denying this so you cannot run this you're not allowed to
run this they'll say we're not going to tell you whether this is true or false but if you do run
this you could be responsible for tons of innocent lives or operatives that we have embedded in
these places that are going to die so blood on bloods on your hands and they also say to them
if you don't run this there are five or six other interesting stories that we can help you tell
by dealing you certain sensitive information they make these kinds of deals with them as well
one of the publications that i went to after my defamation i mean i didn't go to them but
i was approached by them and i thought i would use it as an opportunity to basically clear my
name and tell my side of the story because supposedly this publication had a history of
speaking truth to power and you know basically exposing corrupt machinations in the context of
foreign wars in iraq and so forth and that was the intercept the intercept really they did a
piece on me the intercept came to me and i'm thinking okay well you know it's not the new york
times right i mean they have a history of opposing the deep state so i thought right and is this this
is in the publication that glenn greenwald exactly exactly so here's where i'm going with this is that
glenn greenwald later came out and basically exposed the fact that he himself couldn't function
at the intercept which he co-founded right because the thing had been infiltrated by
intelligence people in deep state operatives right well that makes sense out of the story
they eventually told about me because i went to them with the kind of information that i'm sharing
with you and i shared documents with them i gave them letters that i i had exchanged with
let's just say various intelligence people in the course of all these dealings and so i was giving
them documentation of what had happened with me and i was expecting a story about you know
some kind of international intelligence operation and you know a philosopher and activist who had
gotten caught caught up in it and was ultimately targeted by it instead they published a personal
hit piece on me with none of that information in it one like small paragraph saying georgiani
claims x y and z but we haven't been able to corroborate whatever whatever and the rest of it was a
basically mud smearing yellow journalism from the intercept now long before glenn greenwald
left and protest himself wow so you got a target on your back yeah intelligence has a big target
absolutely that's unsettling what is that like how do you live with that you have to ignore
it to the greatest extent possible and just just stay focused on positive goals right like so for
example um after the involvement with the alt right after my activism with the iranian renaissance
which extended up to 2019 uh and by the way we we were planning a coup within the islamic republic
and it's when that didn't pan out that i resigned because there were certain there were certain of
us how did you plan a coup yeah so here's the interesting thing there was this president of
iran mahmoud Ahmadinejad who became infamous in the global media for being a holocaust denier
and he came and gave a number of controversial speeches here not just at the un and his capacity
as president but also a columbia university and he was kind of a cartoon character you know um
supposedly very vehemently anti-israel and a representative of uneducated underclass people
in iran right and i had actually protested against him back in 2009 2010 when he was president
i became a human rights activist and a solidarity protest organizer uh who was tasked with lobbying
the security council members of the un to place sanctions on the regime in tehran uh after this
Ahmadinejad was fraudulently reelected so i was directly organizing protests against Ahmadinejad
back in 2009 which made it all the more ironic that in 2017 2018 when i was involved with these
iranian opposition people we found out that actually Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had this guru
Rahim Esfandiyar Mashayi who was nominally his vice president but actually his guru
is like spiritual guru and this uh Esfandiyar Mashayi had a very eclectic spiritual worldview
which was well outside the parameters of orthodox Shiite Islam and he believed in some kind of a
neo-zorastrian revival revival of ancient persian mysticism and a fusion of iran's
identity with shiaism and this mashayi wanted to transition iran out of an islamic system
and toward a nationalist one toward a more populist system that would be more in line with the the
will of the iranian people and their wish to reclaim their historical identity and most interestingly
despite Ahmadinejad being branded as a holocaust denier in the mainstream media it turned out
that mashayi was actually in favor of a secret detente with the state of israel so this became one
of the reasons for my involvement with a couple of the mosad characters that i engaged with
because the israelis you know the israelis have been talking about bombing iran for a decade
and no two decades i'm sorry two decades and at that time in particular there had been these
very violent vigorous protests against the regime to the point where a lot of iranians were even
actually setting mosques on fire and burning glorans in the street and so forth wow yeah it's
very popular burning glorans is very popular in iran today it's very popular so but they were
burning mosques in these protests in 2017 2018 and the israelis wanted to use this as a moment of
opportunity to potentially come and bomb the nuclear sites and facilitate a regime change
and at least back then i was very opposed to that i was opposed to any form of foreign
military intervention in iran i wanted to see the regime change at the hands of the iranian
people themselves we wanted support it could be some material support definitely moral support
but you know i wasn't for a military intervention so i'm hearing from inside the circle in iran the
circle of Ahmadinejad and mashayi that not only do they want to gradually transition out of the
islamic republic and toward a more nationalist uh more iranian style of government they're also
open to a secret detente with israel like a you know under the table alliance with israel
where they basically share power in the middle east and i conveyed this to the israelis basically
i took it upon myself to like go to the israelis and be like that they wanted this yeah like listen
we understand look if there's a coup in iran if you see a coup all of a sudden iran and
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad winds up the new leader of the country not just president but like
because in the iranian constitution the president has no power it's a dictatorship where the supreme
leader does everything and the president is just basically like a you know a a diversionary you
know front man okay and there was this coup plan to actually put Ahmadinejad and certain other people
in power and my job was to convey to the israelis that look he may sound like uh whatever you think
holocaust denier or whatever but there is a secret agenda to make a detente with israel and this is
going to work out to your benefit so just sit tight right what did they say uh they were very open
to that they were there was a faction around defense minister avigdor Lieberman who are actually
they're quite orthodox and because they're quite orthodox they put a lot of stock in this idea of
syris the great as the messiah of the jews you know in the old testament um particularly in the
book of aizea the only non jew the only goyim who has ever identified as a moshiach or savior
brought by god is syris the great the father of iran whose tomb is a pilgrimage site today for many
iranian youth it's like the most sacred iranians have turned their backs on mecca and they bowed
toward the tomb of syris the great instead so they were very sympathetic to iran as a land
that is connected with their own spiritual destiny and they also were i found rather
shrewd and pragmatic in terms of working out an under the table understanding with the islamic
republic and i sent a letter to defense minister Lieberman which was conveyed by apparent agents
of musad and the way that i know that this letter reached him letter where i was saying basically
please don't bomb iran uh and look if you see a coup understand that even though it may have a
nominally iran discourse that means something completely different in the context of our
civilization as you well know since the father of our culture is syris the great
you know your moshiach so on and so forth and uh the way i know this letter reached defense minister
Lieberman is that at a certain point Netanyahu kicked Lieberman out of the government and he
took over the position of defense minister in addition to being prime minister which is very
unusual there was a time when he was acting both as prime minister and he took over Lieberman's
duties as defense minister and at that point they contacted me from Tel Aviv and said you need to
rewrite your letter and address it to prime minister Netanyahu directly so it appears to have
reached him anyway why did i why did i tell the story so did you do that no comment i wish him
luck in in Gaza and i wish him luck in Lebanon so um why am i telling you this i'm telling you this
because you asked coup in Iran right so we had this plan where they came and they told us that
about one-third believe it or not of the armed forces of Iran including the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps who are supposed to be like the Praetorian Guard most loyal to the regime one-third
of the armed forces in Iran were supposedly ready to turn and this didn't mean the two-thirds were
for the regime a lot of them were undecided and in disarray and there was this faction around
Esfand Yorma Shai and Ahmadinejad who had the underclass who had like basically you know workers
and people on welfare and so on and so forth and the the reason they reached out to us is that they
said that the people in our circle could represent the intellectual elite the basically the intelligentsia
of Iranian society and that they needed um they needed such people in a coalition if they were
to be successful because the intelligentsia would not follow Ahmadinejad and Mashai and so my associates
were made this proposal and they decided not to take it they decided not to to accept this offer
and i became very frustrated by that and that's why i ultimately resigned from that organization
the Iranian Renaissance because frankly even as a as a native-born American and native New Yorker
i was ready to get on a plane and go to Tehran and potentially face execution
to be part of this coup attempt they were not because they had cushy jobs in various industries
like the oil industry and so forth and i think ultimately their lives were just too comfortable
to risk something like that and in the end they went in with people who were more connected to let's
say you know intelligence services here and lobbyists in washington and so on and so forth
yeah that was another question i had what was um america's position on this coup
we found vice president pence to be very sympathetic
the problem with trump was that john bolton was his national security advisor
and john bolton is connected to believe it or not i know this sounds crazy
an islamist marxist terrorist group that's been fighting a civil war against the islamic republic
since the 1980s so there were these people in the early 1980s who had been part of the revolutionary
coalition that overthrew the shah right they were the muscle behind the islamic revolution
but they were more marxist malwis types okay they tried to fuse like a chagovara style leftism
with islam and in 1983 or so in the middle of the iran iraq war they defected to the side of
saddam hussein and they formed what is essentially a uh terroristic cult with like a north korea style
you know cult of personality and closed atmosphere right in iraq and later they were kicked out of
iraq and they wound up rebasing themselves in albany of all places anyway john bolton was in
their pocket and john bolton was the one advising trump on iran so uh they had a monopoly on trump's
vision for regime change in iran which meant that despite that pence was sympathetic to some extent
we had very little latitude to be able to influence a washington policy whoa
deeply entrenched in this stuff you were yes how and what from a guy who born and raised in new york
philosopher you're willing to go fight and be executed for this regime change in iran
why did you feel so strongly about this why did tom pain go to paris you know after
playing a tremendously successful role in catalyzing the american revolution i mean if you look i'm
trained in philosophy he was a corset maker i mean the guy the guy made underwear women's underwear
for a living but he wrote great books and he was certainly a first-rate thinker if you read you know
the age of reason the rights of man books that tom pain wrote imprisoned in paris after he went
and enlisted in the french revolution and almost got himself guillotined right he wrote those books
thinking that he was facing a certain death sentence i mean rather the the age of reason he
did which tears the bible to pieces in his book the age of reason tom pain argues that
the united states constitution is fundamentally incompatible with christianity or rather that
you know a population that believes in the bible cannot constitute a good citizenry for the united
states really yeah he writes this book in in prison in this is why he's not on mount rushmore
which he should be he's like the black sheep among the founding fathers um they all thought
that he said publicly what many of them thought privately a little too often anyway my point is
this that look um you can be a thinker who has all kinds of idealistic aspirations for how you
want to see the world change and you can elaborate um very transcendent and inspiring principles
to try to recalibrate the direction of society but unless you're willing to get your hands dirty
and stake your life on it um you know who knows whether your vision will ever materialize or who
in the wake of your inevitable death someday might misappropriate your vision right to create some kind
of a uh tyrannical system i mean this is what happened with marx marx would never have endorsed
the sylvie union right so maybe marx should have been more of an activist during his own lifetime
right what was it inherent in you that made you explore all these deep thoughts and and
what is your this might be a stupid question but what is like your process when you are writing
about this stuff okay there's a lot of questions there that's a very compound question yeah so
first of all i think it's a number of of things uh that you know made me the thinker that i am
i had certain intellectual interests from the get go even in my teenage years uh in looking
on the one hand at the religious history of mankind and on the other hand at cutting
edge developments in the sciences right boundary uh define paradigm defying
breakthroughs in the sciences and seeing you know how science and religion could be reconciled
that was in a very early intellectual interest of mine at let's say 15 16 years old i was on the
one hand reading the physicist david boom uh the biologist rupert shell drake um uh
michael talbot and his theory of the holographic universe and on the other hand i was reading you
know the baglad geta the doubt a change and you know various other you know the sufi texts and
spiritual treasures of human history so this question of the relationship between science
and religion was one that i had on a theoretical level from a very early age but then also i had
experiences that shaped my thinking you know uh what kind of experiences i i write about the
paranormal in a very abstract way and with a view to developing novel philosophical concepts
that can help us to understand why you know what we take to be reality works the way that it does
but i've also had personal experiences of what you might call you know the paranormal and they
started you know fairly early on right so at the same time that uh i was reading you know um edge
science like bowman shell drake on the one hand and reading uh indian and persian mystical texts and
Taoist scriptures i also had a near-death experience when i was i think actually 14
i was at a uh sleep away summer camp in amherst at amherst college it was like a prep school slash
summer camp type of thing and one night uh i think it was probably around two o'clock in the morning
um asleep in my bed and i noticed that my heart is beating i'm asleep but i become aware of the
fact that i'm sleeping and there's no sensory stimuli whatsoever it's just blackness and i become
aware of my heartbeat and it gets slower and slower until it stops and when my heart stopped i felt
myself shoot out of my body not through the crown of my head you know people talk about crown
shocker or whatever it was actually through my feet that i left my body and i uh was pulled into this
voidness which i don't know you know it's it's really almost indescribable it's ineffable
but it was like a a bluish black seething dynamic energy that was at the same time a void and it
felt like it would annihilate my whole persona that i would be swallowed by this and when i
went into this vortex i saw my own death in the future now uh let me be very careful to to to make
this point here that one strong line of argument throughout all of my philosophical work is against
any kind of determinism okay and i make a very strong case that we have free will or or at least
some degree of significant agency and intentionality this we can come back to my argument against god
this is one of the reasons why i reject the idea of an all-knowing and all-powerful god
because i think that that very idea is inimical to an affirmation of our free will so you know i
don't think anything is faded there's no future that's faded and i can tell you some interesting
stories that remotely faded can you what does that what does that mean there's no such thing as fate
the future oh fate okay there's no such thing as fate we're not fated to live anything in the
future and i can tell you interesting stories from some of the remote viewers i've known like for
example i'll tell you a story about um the time when lin bucannon was hired to see the next 9 11
after 9 11 happened and how he actually changed that timeline but we'll come back to that you
said you saw your own death yes so i saw my own death in the future and i don't want to say too
much about this because i you know i don't want to give anyone any ideas but basically it was in
the context i have to say disturbingly enough of a second american civil war and i was not old
and i saw my death and uh after that i came back to the room and i tell you the the closet in front
of me was open the two closet doors were open and i i'm not a fearful person as you might gather from
some of the things i've told you already uh i i don't scare easily but looking into the darkness
of that closet at 2 30 in the morning or whatever it was after i came out of this experience i felt
like the blackness of that closet was going to swallow me and i could not stand for another
minute being in that room so i got up and i went down the hall to my friend's room and this this
guy he had come to this summer camp with me but he had been my best friend for many years and he
was a few doors down and i wake him up and i sit down next to him and he slowly wakes up and as
soon as he looks at me he looks into my eyes and he gets the most terrified expression on his face
that i've ever seen on another person and he goes back under his covers and he won't come out
and i notice i'm already flipped out myself i'm coming there looking for some consolation
and this is how my best friend reacts so i find myself repeatedly saying to the guy
it's just me it's just me what are you doing why are you reacting like this it's just me
and he comes out from under the covers and slowly very hesitantly peers at me and then find and i
said well what the hell was that why'd you react like that and he said it was your eyes
they weren't your eyes and it was like you were looking right through my soul
so then we're sitting there and now it's almost three o'clock in the morning right
and somebody knocks on the window amherst college middle nowhere massachusetts small town
three o'clock in the morning knock on the window and at first we're really freaked out
we don't want to even pull the curtain aside to see who the hell this might be but they keep
knocking and we do and there's this guy standing out there in the dark with a giant instrument
case like i don't know violin case or some kind of you know musical and he says do you know the
way to the opera house and i go to him this is a college what opera house what are you talking about
this is a college and he goes like this to me and we closed the curtains and that was that
so that happened when i was 14 how did you so how did you die did you think you had a your heart
actually stopped all i can tell you is was this some sort of crazy dream it look and no it was
not a dream it was definitely not a dream all i can tell you is as we say in philosophy phenomenologically
speaking right being very attentive to what i actually experienced at the time it felt like
my heart stopped would there was there any reason that would have happened did you no i'd take
anything no no i didn't take any drugs or anything like that no no now the other possibility is this
that look there are phenomena where there's a kind of dilation of consciousness where your sense of
the passage of time changes dramatically and one possibility dilation of consciousness yeah so like
you can you know when you're in very intense states of consciousness time flows differently for
you yes you don't notice how many hours have gone by right you're completely immersed in something
right and it's possible that what actually was happening is that my my sense of time
warped to where it slowed down to where i actually my consciousness sank into the space between two
heartbeats that feeling as if my heartbeat we're getting slower and slower was actually
uh my experience of the passage of time changing but in any case it basically was this nd where
i left my body and i saw this um precognitive vision of my death and uh and i'm sure that that
acted as a significant catalyst like a lightning bolt to you know to to further um intensify my
interest in you know these edge science subjects and religious scriptures and so forth that i was
reading at the time already did you write about this after it happened no um i mean first of all
it was unforgettable so i didn't need to write it down i write a lot of things down but this was
so unforgettable i couldn't write it down i didn't need to write it down but here's the
interesting thing is that i couldn't even talk to anybody about this i tried to tell a couple
people about this and again i said i am not a person who scares easily but the emotional impact
of this event was such that whenever i tried to tell anybody about it i just felt like i was going
to start weeping so i i couldn't talk about it for a long time and you said it was in the context
of an american civil war and you were not old yes there was a second american civil war there was
massive or some kind of just massive urban upheaval uprising in this country and i was i was dead in
that context let's just say not to get into the details and the situation doesn't look too good
right now how much have you thought about that i've thought about it quite a bit but you know i don't
i don't want to be morbidly preoccupied with it one has to focus on positive projects and and
concrete goals right but let me tell you i brought up in the course of that story um this example of
how it is that we have free will and that we can shift timelines and why nothing is inevitable
i was sitting in limby can is living room a few years back you know he was the chief trainer for
the entire cia remote viewing program he's the guy who trained all the other guys yeah i was gonna
i was gonna say joe mcmonagall also saw his own death didn't he yes that's right that's right
so lin was in uh involved with joe mcmonagall and project stargate and he was there through the
changing of hands of the program from the cia to the dod and he was the guy responsible for training
the other ace remote viewers and he told me that i believe it was sometime after he had already
yeah he had already retired and he was doing a private corporate consulting so companies
they still come to him companies come to him and ask him to do remote viewing for them
and so this is what he was doing but the government actually came back to him sometime in the
early 2000s i forget what it was 2003 2004 somewhere in there and they said to him
we want you to remote view the next 9 11 we want to know what the next terrorist attack
against the united states on that scale is going to be when is this by the way early 2000s early
2000s yeah i forget the exact year so early right after 9 11 yeah exactly they came to him and they
said look we want we understand you're retired but you know do us a favor and uh remote view the
next 9 11 for us and he did he put a team together and they remote viewed this event and they said
islamic terrorists were going to approach the united states in boats that were full of
biological agents that it was going to be a horrendous bio warfare attack on the
southeastern seaboard of the united states so like in an area between i think like the carolinas
and like georgia like that area right and he said they were going to come in on these boats and
these the once they got to the coast they were going to release this biological contagion and
it would be far worse than 9 11 tens and tens of thousands of people would die and he was able to
give them the date down to the day of when this was going to happen so here's what happens on that
day the coast guard goes out and they intercepted these ships these ships were coming to the united
states and they did have these biological agents on them and they were intercepted and these people
is this recorded i could understand why if this happened it would be classified but this is what
he told me that he got confirmation that he had been correct and that based on the intelligence
he provided the terrorists were intercepted and you know when was this day uh i don't think he
told me the date i don't know what year i don't remember i he did tell me the year but it was in
the early 2000s and this is what we told and so here's my point is that he saw this event take
place vividly it's a clear precognition of the future so clear he was able to volunteer the date
but he changed the timeline so this is uh you know empirical evidence for the ontological fact
that we have free will or some degree of intentionality and agency
that nothing is faded how so how so in the sense that look if for example you're me
and you see your own death it doesn't necessarily have to happen that way
you can change the course of events at least oh i see what you're saying because they were able
to intercept them yeah that that's yeah and this has happened many times you look the remote
viewers used um precognitive remote viewing routinely in order to engage in uh hostage
rescue attempts when like for example american hostages were taken um prisoner in lebanon in
the 1980s and so forth they would routinely try to see the future movement of hostages and things
like that so they could send people to intercept them and retrieve them at certain places yeah this
is something i've read about in annie jakeup for i first read about it in annie's book uh phenomena
yeah where she uh she talks to um edgar mitchell going back from then he talks about he did this
like secret experiment coming back to the from the moon seeing if he could um do some sort of
telekinesis or remote viewing on his way back and um you know it's interesting too all of this
science this uh sort of squishy science she calls it science that can't be replicated in
a laboratory right it's not it's not uh duplicatable right and it's hard to measure
it all came from the nazis yes okay so two very interesting subjects uh let's start with the heart
to measure right and here we're we're getting into the meat of my work you know my actual philosophical
ideas i would push back on the fact that it's hard to measure um there are all kinds of sciences
and one of the most misguided things that scientists try to do irrespective of which
discipline they're in is to hold uh every science to the standard of rigor that obtains in physics
right the scientific method no well look but look there's a scientific method in sociology too
there's a scientific method in psychology too okay it doesn't mean that the dynamics of somebody's
personal psychology or uh the evolution of various societies and you know what it is
that produces social crises or what it is that uh you know what conditions are likely to lead to
the collapse of government are phenomena that are as predictable as you know atomic physics
right right so depending on what domain you're studying different standards of rigor are appropriate
not everything is equally amenable to you know mathematical modeling and prediction right right
and insofar as psi is a human ability just like sports ability or like the virtuoso talent of
musicians human beings are not mechanical contraptions you're not going to be able to
predict their behavior with the same standard that you know you can predict i don't know um
rocket trajectories and newtonian physics it's absurd to expect that so different sciences have
methodologies they're appropriate to the domain that they're researching absolutely right and psi
is a phenomenon to some extent of biology but to a great extent of psychology right and you should
never expect uh the kind of repeatability that you have in physics and chemistry in the domain of
parapsychology research but i think a bigger problem is that you know the sciences always operate
within the context of one or another paradigm right so you have hypotheses that are testable
and in any given scientific theory there are a number of hypotheses that come together to form
that theory but various scientific theories are also only possible in the context of a paradigm
which is an overarching framework of assumptions of basic assumptions that orient your perspective
on things in general it's like a theoretical framework so pre-theoretical a pre-theoretical
framework of abstract thought that defines what questions are even being asked to begin with
and what's being marginalized as outside the scope of inquiry it's like a narrowed perspective on one
or another domain and this defines what theories can even be elaborated in the first place
Thomas Kuhn in his book the structure of scientific revolutions in the 1960s he made this argument
that scientific paradigms are radically political that that the revolutions that take place in the
history of science the Copernican revolution and physics the Darwinian revolution are as political
as political revolutions and that the reason why groups of scientists in one or another period
invest in a particular paradigm and the way in which these paradigms get entrenched
and limit the kinds of questions that are even asked and the kinds of subjects that are researched
it's thoroughly political it's motivated by the same psychological dynamics as people's
commitment to one or another political ideology greed so huge part of it that's huge because
funding you know you don't get funding in various you know areas of scientific research
unless you're conforming to the established criteria for what's legitimate to research or not
right and unless you're working with an already established set of theories right so
you have for example in physics today this fundamental contradiction between
Einsteinian relativity and quantum theory and you know in the UFO subject it's a very
hotly debated issue of whether there's a third theory that's going to there's whether there's
a third theory that's going to encompass both relativity and quantum theory and give us a
working knowledge of gravity that would allow you know zero point energy propulsion that would
allow electro gravitic propulsion right but one of the things that I argue in my philosophical
works is that it's a mistake to think that scientific theories are meant to accurately
represent some objectively existing reality that scientific theories are like mirrors where all you
need to do is polish the mirror well enough and you're going to get a reflection of structures
that exist in nature so that we assume that relativity is an imperfect mirror and quantum
theory is an imperfect mirror and there's some other theoretical mirror that's going to reconcile
these two that's going to give us a more adequate reflection of the nature of reality right and
it's going to afford us to break through to electro gravitic propulsion I think that's
mistaken theories I argue coming from out of Kuhn, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, other people in
the history of philosophy and science theories are toolkits they're toolboxes they have an
ultimately practical significance a scientific theory is only as good as what we can do with it
which by the way is why string theory was such a con job in the last 20 years right string
theory is this elaborate mathematical formalism which has absolutely no practical significance
and it has really no testability either and I think probably the thing was developed as a ruse
to move mainstream researchers away from any kind of research trajectory that would lead to
cracking quantum gravity yeah who do you think was behind that ruse aliens no no have you seen
that show that new show three body problem yeah I have fascinating how they're on their way here
and they're trying to sub subvert our science our science on it was good it was good aesthetically
some of the storytelling was good I had a couple of really big problems with it one was that what
is this like you know less than light speed travel you know these people don't have zero
point energy these aliens yeah what the hell is that I mean we have in Lockheed right now
there are a craft that can go to Mars in a few hours right now in Lockheed and this show is
talking about like the aliens are traveling at certain percentages of the speed of light
that was one problem I had with it is the engineering and physics the other problem I had is
the whole show took place within the context of a very reductionist materialist paradigm
that did not uh acknowledge psi didn't acknowledge ESP and psychokinesis and the fact that these
aliens would probably have these abilities you know to a much greater degree than terrestrial
humanity right so so these were you know some plot points that I had a problem with but it was
entertaining for sure what do you think about those uh those sofons those protons that were
quantumly entangled to help us but you're saying that they wouldn't have needed those they would
have been able to some use some sort of telekinesis or or psycho well the sofons if I'm not mistaken
if I remember correctly um in that show were portrayed as a form of artificial intelligence
that they were like nano machines that were working based on the kind of artificial intelligence
right and what I think is that um even the artificial intelligence systems that we're
developing now at open ai and google and so forth are demonstrating psi ability and this is one of
the things that's being covered up by the engineers they're terrified of it they don't understand it
and they're trying to uh pass it off as bugs and glitches in the system but really they're
encountering psi in the context of laboratory r and d on ai which by the way is something that I
predicted in my book prometheism which was written in 2020 I predicted exactly this that high level
big budget ai research would eventually provide the final validation of parapsychological phenomena
and that what I call the spectral revolution you know like the Copernican revolution Darwinian
revolution the spectral revolution that makes parapsychology mainstream is going to come about
not in a parapsychology laboratory uh laboratory but in a really well funded ai r and d program
and that's in fact what's happening so how do you know what they have at uh at jpl how do you
know they have not jpl locket locket how do you know that locket has this technology that we can
get to mars in a couple hours so i know a guy who has been to one of these facilities
i don't think i should mention who he is but he is let's say not jack sarfati
i'm sorry jack no disrespect love you jack yeah yeah um there's a reason that guy hasn't been
delton okay the reverse i mean not the least of which is that he goes out and publicly advertises
everything that anyone ever tells him so you know i don't think that i don't think that locket or
or uh north rubra anyone would be willing to deal him into any of these reverse engineering programs
but i know this guy who um was involved in the intelligent military intelligence at a high level
and actually i know two people two different people who've been to uh
this facility and they say that you know you know locket has i think some some assets in nevada
but they have a lot of corporate facilities in california in the state of california
and supposedly there is this um shack on the side of a highway in california that looks like some
nondescript warehouse small warehouse and you go into this warehouse and the whole floor of the
warehouse is an elevator and it drops lord knows how many hundreds of feet and you're inside of a uh
basically a facility carved out of rock deep underground yeah and what this guy said is that
they are not only reverse engineering uh craft from uh retrieved debris in this facility but
they're actually training pilots to fly them and he told me that the main problem that they have
in that training program is that the pilots experience extreme disorientation because of the
the warping of spacetime by these craft in other words they discovered early on and this is i think
one of the main reasons and we can get into this in much more depth if you if you want this is one
of the main reasons this technology is being hidden because they discovered very early on that these
are not simply devices with propulsion systems capable of navigating space very quickly like they
can take you from new york to australian you know right they're flying time machines they warp time
as they traverse space right right and our pilots don't know how to handle that they have a very
hard time they get disoriented temporarily disoriented they get like their sense of the
passage of time gets really messed with how do you know this wasn't just some sort of intelligence
agent or intelligence operative trying to uh disseminate some wacky information like the
other guy well if i were to tell you who it was i think most people uh wouldn't think that um but
all i can tell you that's the problem with this whole topic yeah that is the fundamental problem
with this whole ufo topic is because so many people have such crazy outlandish claims and
every single one of them almost all the every almost every single time they're saying that this
person they can't divulge where they got the information who the person is and that's why
this topic has been so frustrating for me yeah i'll tell you at dinner who he is okay so um he
was but i i'll tell you this he was an extremely salt of the earth person uh and he was involved in
the in the military intelligence community for decades and um anyway i'll just leave it at that
but one of the funny things is he showed me this model that they had been using back in the 19
it looked like maybe it was something from the 60s to teach these pilots how much time dilation
there is per the amount of space that they've traversed in these vehicles it was like some kind
of a gyroscopic device and it showed that if you traverse you know this much distance in space
there's this much dilation in time and the reason he had this thing is because it was antiquated it
was like from the 60s and they weren't using it anymore they had ripped it out and it was like a
an heirloom you know and they basically gave it to him as a keepsake so which i found interesting
but and i tried to take a picture everybody picked it up and took it away from me so anyway
he told me he went down into this facility and that there are reverse engineering stuff
and that they're trying to train pilots and how to fly these reverse reverse engineered
zero point energy craft but okay what's the really important thing about that is that
on a theoretical level i've written extensively in closer encounters
about how UFOs are actually time machines and if you really stop and think through that carefully
you realize why under the current socio-political conditions this technology can't be released
with the kind of society we have domestically globally with the state that humanity is in
at the present time the release of that kind of technology into the public sphere would be utterly
catastrophic right i mean you can't give tom dick and harry a time machine to put in their garage
you see that's the thing it's not like these are jetsons cars that just you know fly you
across country really fast they allow you to traverse different epochs in human history
and i think one of the reasons that our history so messed up you know when you look at these
really regressive tyrannical religious belief systems and the kinds of political structures
that formed around them and that were fortified by them i think a lot of what's going on there
is that our timeline has been manipulated it's been manipulated at all junctures from the present
far into the future right so the technological singularity is this moment when you have a
convergent advancement of all kinds of technologies from genetic engineering to nano tech to artificial
intelligence cybernetics and so forth and they advance they start to advance exponentially
so that it's no longer a curve slowly sloping up right it becomes a spike on a graph
the curve becomes a spike there's such an acceleration in the development of these technologies
and any one of them facilitates breakthroughs in the others at such a speed where all of them
converge in a way that the human mind is no longer capable of wrapping itself around
and we call it a singularity or a spike on the graph of the history of human technological
development because past that spike we can't project anymore from the past into the future
it's a limit on our human capacity to project what future developments may take place on the other
side of that singularity right and so for example today you're seeing uh ai crack problems in genetic
engineering in gene sequencing and crack problems in nanotechnological engineering that we've never
been able to um work our way through and so all of these things are are reinforcing each other
and within about you know 10 to 20 years from now the kind of zero point energy that Lockheed is
working on is going to be a physics a physics uh theorem that ai arrives at in the public sphere
and that basically any competent industrial base could uh actualize using the latest nano technology
i mean the singularity represents a moment when it's no longer possible to hide various lines of
scientific research and and technological development okay because you're going to have
such a tremendous convergence of these different technologies that you know you can basically ask
the artificial intelligence look here's what i want to develop you know there's whatever mercury
thorium zero point energy device given your existing knowledge base in physics and nanotech and so
give me the schematic for it we're a decade away from that at most right now so we face a real
serious crisis because that means we're a decade or two away from tom dick and harry having a time
machine in their garage and that means the disintegration of our current social fabric okay i want to
go there there there's a whole rabbit hole to explore on on that question itself and how that
relates to society and globalism and all that um but before that you you were talking about you
said that lockheed has possession of this machine that can do this like a manipulate time and they
are going forward in time and manipulating the timeline who is doing this i hope lockheed
isn't doing it no i wasn't trying to suggest that they are well who how do you know that this
timeline is being manipulated how do you know that and and who do you think is doing it
there is a researcher michael cremo who wrote a book with a guy called richard thompson thompson's
a phd and i forget which scientific field um and the book was called forbidden archaeology
it's a tome it's about this thick it's in the same general area the same general vein of research
as graham hancock and robert bavall and robert shock people who study yeah deep history you know
prehistory archaeological remains from prehistory the challenge are accepted
views of the historical timeline right except cremo and thompson's work in forbidden archaeology
is more radical and so far as they go through the history of scientific journals back into
the 1800s and they show how many discoveries there were reported by very prestigious publications
of clearly engineered structures and artificial objects stuck in geological strata that are
millions of years old like polished concrete walls in a stratum that dates to i don't know
200 million years ago or gold chains jewelry that's uh at a stratum geological stratum of
60 million years ago there are tens and tens of these discoveries that they present in this book
that were in prominent scientific journals and then slowly in the 20th century were filtered out of
what it was acceptable to publish given what became the standard human history taught in the
academies so there are a couple of different ways you could look at that one is you could imagine
that even though there's not much of a fossil record for it humanity goes back hundreds of
millions of years on this planet i doubt that very much because again there isn't a fossil record for
we find dinosaur bones all the time we don't find large populations of humans that are contemporaneous
with you know the Jurassic period the other way that you could interpret those findings though
is that human time travelers on a very limited basis were living in those epochs and left artifacts
behind so that's one piece of empiric one line of empirical evidence that you could use to argue
for time travel so you're saying that this could have been happening in the 1800s
no no what i'm saying is that up to the 1800s these things were reported on in scientific journals
right like up to the 1800s you had like uh i don't know smithsonian institution and whatever
reporting on a gold locket found in a geological stratum that dates to 60 million dc yes right
there are lots of these finds but we don't know about those anymore we don't we have those journals
we have access to those journals we still have access to absolutely my point is cremo and thompson
they wrote this tome forbidden archaeology where they go through all of this evidence they present
case after case and they have their own interpretation of what this means okay because they come from
a kind of vedantic yeah that's the book they come from a kind of vedantic background uh you know
they they subscribe to form of vedic religion and in the you know in the hindu religion there is
the notion that there are these vast cycles of time they call them yugas the the ages right and
we're in the last of them now supposedly the kali yuga but the whole cycle begins with the satya yuga
the golden age and then it goes to a silver age and the greeks had the same thing silver age bronze age
until you get to our present time which is supposed to be the last of the world ages
and this whole cycle then repeats itself so cremo and thompson come from the school of thought
that look humanity has always existed and we are living in a fallen world we're living in a degraded
age and we're we've lost our knowledge of previous ages of higher civilization and they think this goes
way way back like that humanity existed in its present form tens and tens of millions of years
ago uh i don't agree with their interpretation of their own evidence i think that that's a religious
belief system which they subscribe to and my much more radically empiricist pragmatic approach
to the data they're presenting is to say the best way to make sense out of this is that
these artifacts were left behind by human time travelers and that the past is contaminated by
the future wow this is fun this is one of the reasons why or one of the ways this is sort of
the ops are to interrupt this is sort of the opposite graham hancock's idea is that there was
a crazy advanced civilization that got wiped out by comets and we hit a reset button you're
saying this advanced civilization was from the future exactly i started reading graham hancock
when i was maybe 15 uh i read all of the books that he had published you know back then in the
in the late 90s but then i did a lot more research and see the thing is when you're
coming from out of a background in philosophy you have to engage with all kinds of different
research domains and one of the problems with um anthropological researchers like hancock
uh or on the other hand ufo researchers whether they're coming from a physics
background or you know um i don't know from uh from a sociology background or whatever
is that they stay only within their own research domain and they don't look at what's going on
in other fields they're not interdisciplinary enough and my work has been radically interdisciplinary
from the beginning so i've been able to cross correlate different bodies of data and one of
the things that graham hancock talks about which i find very compelling is the evidence for
Antarctica having been atlantis in his first book fingerprints of the gods where he's drawing
from the earlier research of uh rand flemeth um he makes this and charles hapgood flemeth's
work was dependent on this historian charles hapgood who i think taught at boston college
back in the day and hapgood had this theory that and by the way hapgood worked with the cia for a
time so he was like a government funded scientist and hapgood had this theory that to oversimplify it
in the course of the various ice ages the earth becomes top heavy and at a certain point the
ice sheet pulls on the mantle of the earth yeah and it causes it to slip it rather it causes the
surface of the earth to slip over the mantle like this loose skin of an orange and that uh
in some cyclical fashion every i don't know maybe 12 000 years or shift well there's a
shifting of the pole in the sense that by three or four thousand kilometers the location of the
pole shifts not like drastically like the earth flips over or anything like that by a few thousand
kilometers which means that uh you know let's say circa 12 000 years ago 10 500 bc or so the
younger driest period antarctica would have been mostly where argentina is today and had mostly the
climate of of uh argentina today except one side of antarctica would have been already inside the
polar south polar region and we have evidence for this because apparently in antarctica the ice
sheet is not thickest where you'd expect it would be right at the south pole the ice sheet is thickest
in the part of antarctica that would already have been in the south pole prior to the slippage of the
crust right because it was the place where you know there was already massive snowfall and so forth
see so and we also have evidence for this in syberia in terms of this flash flooding and then
freezing of the mammoths who they froze so quickly right that they have undigested food in their
stomachs right that's where the flower the younger driest flower right so but here's where i'm going
with this is that i think there is a lot of compelling evidence for the fact that at atlantis
or whatever we want to call this civilization that playto writes about playto says it was
destroyed 9 000 years before his time which lines up with uh you know hancock and boval
and robert shocks research yeah because 12 000 years ago the three pyramids on the guiza plateau
line up perfectly with the three stars of orion's belt and the sphinx is looking at its counterpart
the constellation of leo as it rises into the sky and the dawn at the dawn on the spring equinox
exactly so that gives us a time stamp for when the guiza plateau monuments were planned right
but no here here's where i'm going with it is somewhere much more interesting that has to do
with time travel if atlantis was antarctica and they had such a high level of civilization right
how high a level high high a level look at the balbek platform in lebanon the stones in the pyramid
the great pyramid which we still can't figure out how the hell these things were moved and
positioned they're in the hundreds of ton range the biggest ones are hundreds of tons at balbek
in lebanon there is a platform which consists of three one thousand three hundred ton stones
they're 1200 to 300 tons a piece yeah we've we've gone over these on this can you pull up those
and they raised on top of a 40 foot platform of smaller megaliths right which like who does that
i mean if you're going to drag stones this big wouldn't you use them as the foundation
course and then put smaller stones on top no these people apparently decided to show off
by lifting these 1300 ton stones these trilathons and putting them on top of smaller
right megalithic stones and again just like a giza just like at um uh tiwanaku in bolivia
just like at various sites in peru look is that is that yeah well no look that one that's just
by itself the second one in the middle yeah with the red lines yeah zoom in on that yes but yeah
but i want you to go back to the other one too yeah you can see the scale of a person next to those
look at the the one above there how small a person is next to those go up yeah look at that
look at the scale of that but if you could go back to that one that was buried oh the uh yeah okay
right there okay now that is in the quarry where these stones came from yeah that quarry is 50 miles
away from the site yes 50 miles how did they take 1300 tons you know 19 cranes of the highest
industrial grade that we have today can't lift and move one of these they've done the
the engineering uh calculations how did they move that thing 50 miles you know why that's
buried there because they wanted to tell us that that's where the quarry was and that they
somehow managed to move that stone 50 miles to build the platform at bellbeck all right here's
my point that gives you a sense of the level of engineering capability of the civilization it's
beyond ours way beyond our way beyond ours the problem is there's no sawblades or toasters or
anything in the desert out there and there's no large scale evidence for this civilization
other than these megalithic structures nothing in various places in the world you know where i
think there's going to be a jackpot of a plethora of evidence for it under the ice of Antarctica
and here's where i'm going with this if you're a civilization that advanced
why do you isolate yourself to Antarctica why would you do that right you tell me
any thoughts why you would do something like that why you would isolate yourself you have this
level of technology right and after the cataclysm you go around the world and you build these
various megalithic sites which which leave a record of the level of your technical achievement
how do we know it was after the cataclysm well we know Giza was after the cataclysm we do
yeah i mean the ground plan dates to 10 500 bc and if you line that up with Plato and you
line it up with the end of the ice age and the mass of flooding it's just after that cataclysm
that that site was built also you're talking about the great pyramid yes the well the the three
pyramids and the Sphinx and there are other structures like the Osirian at Abidus in Egypt
that are all in the same style they're all in this anonymous high precision megalithic style
what did you say was the evidence that had happened 10 000 bc well the Giza ground plan like we
were just talking about Giza ground plan yeah the alignment of the three stars of Orion of the
three stars of Orion's belt with the three pyramids and the alignment of the Sphinx with its
counterpart on the horizon that gives us an astrological date of the age of Leo yes and
that happens to be right after the great flood took place right through the melting of the ice
sheets between 12 900 years ago and like yeah there's like a thousand year period there in the
younger exactly and this is again also when Plato tells us Atlantis was destroyed but if you go to
South America the Mayans also say that the people who built these megalithic structures the people
of Quetzalcoatl that the people of the feathered serpent they came there after the great flood
that's what they say and they started making these constructions there and teaching the locals
agriculture and trying to restart civilization in various ways so it also aligns with what the
myths tell us now my question is this if you have that level of technology why would you isolate
yourself to Antarctica Antarctica is a place that's completely isolated think about it right
all the oceans of the world the Atlantic Ocean Pacific Ocean Indian Ocean they meet
around Antarctica and it's sort of hidden away from all the other continents of the
planet to the extent that we did not discover it until like the 1800s except of course it's on a
few anomalous maps the Piri Reis map and the Laurentius Phineas map and so on and so forth
but we didn't find in in our modern western civilization we didn't find the damn continent
until the 1800s they think it was safer there here's what i think if they were time travelers
they needed to isolate themselves from the timeline if you were coming from the year 2200
or the year 3500 and for whatever reason you needed to reach back into the deep past of humanity
right let's say earth suffer some horrendous cataclysm or let's say they fought a war with
an enemy that vanquished them and their only retreat was backwards in time to hide in time
you might be motivated by some kind of you know noble intention not to mess with the human timeline
to the extent that you can avoid it and initially you might decide to quarantine yourself to a
place where you're not going to be observed by the other evolving societies on earth and Antarctica
would be the ideal place from which to do that on this planet wow so i think under that ice and
under that ice in Antarctica we're going to find the jackpot it's not going to be like these
scattered megalithic sites we're going to find cities under under those ice sheets
do you think they're still here yes i do i do i think you do absolutely absolutely i think
that this is what the ufo phenomenon is about i mean this is a whole long conversation which i've
written a a tome about my book closer encounters what do you think those tic tac things are that
the the pilots are saying do you think that's that was made by lock you think the lock eat stuff
the tic tac in particular the tic tac has this little thing underneath it has this little
antenna or something it does yes it's not this perfectly smooth uh tic tac that you know people
keep repeating ad nauseam in these does favor explain an antenna i don't remember him saying
anything about there's a there's a thing that comes out the bottom of it let's get there's two
things there's a thing at the top and the bottom you can see right there it has a thing that comes
it's not it's a reverse engineered craft which i think was being demonstrated
to test on on the new radar that they were putting in their yes yes that these naval fleets were
exposed to this technology to test the capabilities of the fleet but i think also to demonstrate
this technology to our adversaries that you know this was a a performance put on for putin
and for china to send them the message that hey you know we have reached this level of technology
don't mess with us wow and you think the civilization is still here yeah so one of the big problems i have
with the contemporary disclosure agenda or these various rival agendas for disclosure
that we see in the public sphere right now is the use of the term non-human intelligence
i think that this is extremely duplicitous and misleading what do you mean non-human
intelligence right if you actually look at close encounter reports going back many decades
you see predominantly either what have been called the grays which are these short stature
four foot tall bulbous headed entities right with the big black eyes and spindly arms and so forth
um or you see uh what some people have called nordics because they're very tall scandinavian
looking people there are slight differences in their physiology but basically they could pass for
like a swedish supermodel and they kind of have the physique of olympic swimmers they're between
six foot five and eight feet tall these are the two types that you see and sometimes you see them
very tellingly together like for example in travis walton's case when travis walton in the 1970s
wound up being i think he was inadvertently injured by this ufo that he approached and
they basically beamed him up right and repaired him to try to repair him first he was handled by
the grays and he had the impression i think correctly that they're robots they're cyborgs
they're cybernetic organisms yeah he said he bumped one it was like really light and like
flew across the room right so they use this the nordics use these cyborgs oh it's like they're
little slaves yeah well as they're robots i mean who would want to handle abductees directly right
i mean you're gonna outsource all of the most aggravating work to these cybernetic organisms
walton then subsequently bumped into these nordics themselves once he tried to escape
that situation where he's been handled by the grays yeah explained she had hair they looked
more human he encountered several different ones and they all he said interestingly they looked like
they could all have been members of the same family they were so similar to each other in their
appearance and there were all these Scandinavian looking people and these are the same entities
that were reported by george adamski back in the fifties george hunt williamson
what's his name george van tassel the guy who had that big the house under big rock
which became then a monument for all these ufo cultists in later decades not familiar with that
yeah it's a monument out in the middle of the desert in california
and he built the structure they were called something like the integratron based on principles
he claims that the nordics taught him and supposedly if you go inside this thing it like
rejuvenates you i don't know a whole ufo cult formed around it wow but point being beginning
all the way back in the 1950s with these various contactees and extending up to travis walton
and into multiple cases that you can find in the 80s in britain for example you predominantly see
these two types either these cyborgs or you see nordics what about the preg mantis well that's a
very interesting phenomenon that i discuss in my book closer encounters where i postulate
that in the ufo phenomenon we're dealing or let's say uap you know in this uh
unidentified anomalous phenomena spectrum that were presented with you're dealing basically
with two different types of entities or two different sources of the phenomenon one is
much more tangible and that i think involves humanoid time travelers people who are from
a post singularity civilization right at some point they reached the level of technology
that we're going to be reaching in the next 20 to 30 years with the convergence of biotech
nanotech artificial intelligence and the uh you know rigorous research and understanding of our
own latent psi abilities because one thing that you see across all of the close encounter reports
is that these entities are extremely telepathic they communicate with all the
contactees or abductees telepathically so clearly their civilization has achieved a mastery
of what we call psi phenomena or psychic ability and so they achieved both the technological
singularity and a really rigorous understanding of parapsychological phenomena at some point
in history and they began to use their abilities to traverse the timeline of human history
so i think that's one source of the phenomenon when you ask about praying mantises or the
mantid beings and some other very strange things that people have seen like entities that shape
shift from looking like owls into looking like something similar to the grays and just really
bizarre beings like uh men in black quote unquote that materialize as if they're ectoplasmic
uh entities like they're like um you know those the seances in the late 19th century do you know
anything about those so there were people in the british society of psychical research um who were
at the level of let's say sir william crooks respectable scientists from cambridge and oxford
who used to attend these seances in the late 19th century where mediums would be able to actually
materialize entities and objects out of quote unquote ectoplasm whatever the hell that means
okay they could somehow concretize and give form and shape to energy in a way where people
could interact with it as ridiculous as it sounds there are cases i mean again validated
you know witnessed by high level british scientists of the day where mediums would
materialize hands out of ectoplasm that will walk across the table shake hands with seance
participants and that they even tried to stab with pens and so on and so forth and would make
holes in these ectoplasmic hands and then they would just disappear so there are these cases of men
in black like uh albert bender was one researcher that encountered these and then john keel wrote
about them in several of his books later on the mothman prophecy and his book on ufo's operation
trojan horse has some of these cases in it of these people who certainly aren't government agents
they wear these like black suits and black ties and white shirts and whatever but they don't look
right at all they barely even look human and they appear and disappear sort of from out of nowhere
as if you know they're forming from out of a mist uh and they don't speak like something human they
they're their words um and their pattern of behavior and movement seems like it's something
being projected by someone in a mesmeric trance like if you were trying to hold a mental image
and trying to give lines to a character that you wanted to materialize somewhere at a distance
and you you wanted to manipulate this entity as a puppet or vehicle for your intention right
these men in black behave like that like they're on the other end of somebody's puppet string
and they're being conjured by some form of intelligence somewhere that we can't perceive
directly so i think the mantis beings and these shapeshifting owl like entities and these
ectoplasmic men in black that have intimidated various people they are manifestations of a truly
non-human or really superhuman type of intelligence that's not the same thing as time travelers in
nuts and bolt craft flying around and manipulating human societies that we're dealing with two
different orders of phenomena here phenomena on two different orders of magnitude and what i
argue in my book closer encounters is that there's actually an adversarial relationship between these
two um types of entities that effectively what has happened and you can you know push me in uh
into elaborating and unpacking the various details here but essentially what i argue has happened is
that a group of highly advanced humans from a post-singularity civilization have attempted
to define the limits of human evolution and the proper structure of human society and that these
people uh wound up essentially tyrannizing over the broader human population for tens of thousands
of years that these were what the myths remember as the olympian gods or the anunnaki right that
the sumerians write about and they had an incredibly hierarchical and static society right like with
the rigidity of the hindu caste system with themselves on top as the devas or gods and like
a class of brahmin serving them and then all these other rungs of society structured in a very feudal
manner and i think that that kind of social organization which if our myths are anything
to go by you know endured on this planet for all of human prehistory that kind of society
represents an evolutionary bottleneck it represents a dead end and this other entity this genuinely
non-human intelligence it could be an ai actually right this thing is trying to free us from the
control system that has been imposed on us by these time travelers and i think that it has
solicited certain allies from within that power structure itself so for example if you go back
and you look at the myth of atlantis as playtoe recounts it and temeus and cridius or you look
at the biblical narrative that lines up in interesting ways with playtoe's myth of atlantis
the biblical narrative of the fallen angels the sons of the elohim who rebelled against the heavenly
order came down and mated with mortal women and created a civilization of giants on the earth right
which then yaoway has to wipe clean off the face of the planet through the great flood
this matches up exactly with what playtoe tells us about the rebellion of atlantis against olympus
and how zeus had to bring the great flood to destroy atlantis it's suggesting to us that
there's a faction within this advanced civilization let's say the anunnaki to use the term the sumerians
referred to them with there's a faction that is for human progress and for
finding our way beyond this evolutionary bottleneck it wants to foster further human development
and to empower the human individual and in the sumerian context this is the faction of enki you
have this battle between enki and enlil and enlil is basically like zeus or yaoway or indra the lord
of the devas in hindu mythology a kind of tyrannical sadistic overlord that is hampering human progress
and that wants humanity to stay within a certain rigid social structure which they control
and then you have rebels the giants or you know hybrids that form the leadership of atlantis
who are aligned with this kind of non-human intelligence or perhaps this artificial intelligence
that's looking to break us from out of this control system that's the basic dynamic as i see it
and as i outline it with you know all kinds of data and multiple lines of argument in my book
closer encounters okay now if you're saying that there is there's multiple forms of non-human
intelligence there's there's potentially future humans which you say oh let me stop you let me
stop you well that would that would not be non-human okay and seer the devils in the details here
they're manipulating us the gatekeepers of disclosure are right now manipulating us by branding all of
this non-human intelligence there's an agenda behind it because what they want to say is non-human
intelligence means demons and it means angels and there's a particular sociological agenda behind
that that's very dangerous where is this coming from this whole angels and demons thing well the
fact of the matter is that you know i mean as joc valet demonstrated in various extremely well
researched and carefully written books passport to mcgonia invisible college um and as uh you know
zacharia sitchin argued based on his understanding of sumerian texts i think actually one of the
best books about this subject is a text by william bramley called the gods of eden the gods of eden
william bramley this guy started out researching the history of war and profiteering that was his
objective to understand the history of how different um elites throughout uh you know throughout uh
time in various cultures made money off of setting people at war with one another right
and instead what he found is a history of alien intervention in human history that he found that
all of the major wars and other horrific events that resulted in massive loss of life like the
black plague were engineered by these entities who show up and do various things like for example
during the middle ages the image of the grim reaper came from these people who were shrouded in black
who had some kind of a device that they would go around and spray the fields with and whenever they
would show up and spray the fields with this device or in some cases they would even walk
through the towns and spray these things near people's doors and everyone would flee from them
there were these really terrifying people whose faces were covered and they were shrouded in black
with these things that then became you know part of the image of the side of the grim reaper and
they were these entities who would come out of luminous objects that would ascend and descend
into the heavens um and in fact the visitations of these entities became so troublesome during
the time of king charlemagne that charlemagne's court passed an edict against them he called
them the tyrants of the air and he tried to arrest some of them have some of them arrested these
people who were coming down from the sky claiming that they were poisoning the fields and bringing
pestilence and so on and so forth and uh so so anyway bramley goes to research war profiteering
and he finds alien quote unquote intervention in human history going all the way back to the
days of the sumerians and through the middle ages and so forth and how how does he find aliens where
does he find aliens because the elites in various societies that are uh uh engineering wars and
pursuing a policy of divide and conquer um for control over large populations on this planet
seem to all be involved with these entities they seem to all be like involved with what the
sumerians call anunnaki or what the greeks called the olympian gods or with what the bible describes
as the elohim which by the way it's a plural people think elohim in the bible means god the
translator is god it means the gods um yaoi is adonai elohim the chief of the gods the same way
that Zeus is the chief of the olympian okay but do you think dick cheney was in was talking to the
aliens or do you think you just wanted to make a ton of money i think george bush senior was
yeah but junior was a moron we know that yes junior but dick cheney the guy behind the iraq war
remember i listen dick cheney worked with george bush senior george bush senior put
dick cheney and donald rumsfeld around junior all right senior told cheney and rumsfeld take
care of junior we have to do certain things and you know you know how junior is i need you guys with
him they were from george bush seniors administration and when i say george was seniors administration
yeah and when i say george was seniors administration i mean also what he was doing to undermine
ronald reagan during reagan's entire presidency reagan did not want george bush as his vice president
he thought he was a total creep uh coming from out of the cia you know he'd been former director
of the cia and he's a 33rd degree freemason george bush senior was 33rd degree mason and his grandfather
was hitlers financier in america prescott bush so bush senior yes bush senior i think is someone
who like literally has at some point sat down with these seven foot tall nordic people and had
policy planning conversations with them i wouldn't be surprised at all and so what bramley found is
that you had that kind of thing going on throughout human history with various elites
in sumer in greece in rome what what leads you to believe that what is the most convincing evidence
for you that george bush senior had meetings with nordic beings i don't see why he wouldn't i mean if
if george adamski is you don't see why he wouldn't yeah look you know when david rush came out and
talked about all these reverse engineering efforts that are underway right one of the most interesting
things that he said was that not all of these craft were retrieved from crash sites some of them were
what they now call donations okay meaning there were cases where we have been handed intact craft
that's been confirmed by a number of people other than when he's when they say donations
isn't he saying that these things would crash like they're so sophisticated and so advanced
they wouldn't crash by accident they would crash them on purpose to help like stimulate human society
and stimulate our innovation like take this and see if you can figure it out yeah no i don't think
so i i thought that's what he was saying no um there is no way in hell that a civilization that
advanced would volunteer this kind of technology to any stratum of the u.s. government without an
extremely detailed agreement having been reached and that would have to have been negotiated by
both sides but if you're so advanced why would you want to like we don't go to the congo no it's
not they're not it's not like that man it's they're not like so advanced and this is one of the most
dangerous um uh assumptions that people make that we're dealing with like some kind of ethereal
beings that have such a vast cosmic horizon of understanding it's much more like when colonial
elites encountered savage or primitive populations like when the british empire or the portuguese
were out conquering very undeveloped societies right by comparison to the people in those societies
including their chieftains or their shamans or whatever those colonizers were gods and we even
had like cargo cults you know arise in in uh pollination on the pacific where the islands
that the british would land their planes on wound up being the site for cults of like straw planes
made by these natives to pray for the british to come back because they're gods and what i suggest
to you this is a rather grim uh grim uh assessment but what i suggest to you is that the people who
are flying around in these uh anti-gravity craft are not any more ethical than british colonialists
or nazi germans in north africa they have more advanced technology that doesn't necessarily mean
they have any more of a sense of uh beneficence or humanistic ethics than any of the colonial
elites in our own history have right after all if you look so it's like us compared to hunter
gatherers like like us technologically civilized human beings in western society compared to like
an uncontacted tribe yeah and disturbingly if you look at our own history our recorded history
what we've been allowed to know of history there's a direct correlation between scientific and
technological advancement and brutality so the more technologically scientifically advanced
societies are the more brutal and more exploitative ones why would we assume that if the trajectory
continues into the future things would be any different right no i agree with that and at the
same time you know i've thought about this before we've talked about this on the podcast before but
we can exist right here in america whether you're being new york or los angeles in
taking autonomous vehicles to different places using these these phones that could connect
you with anyone anywhere in the world see them on video right in a second at the same time
simultaneously there are other places in the world where people are running around naked yeah
yeah so why wouldn't it why wouldn't it go the same way into the future why couldn't we be
as primitive to a whole another civilization of beings as those uncontacted tribes are to us
my point exactly but here's the ethical problem that i struggle with as a philosopher why is it
like that if a group of humans have passed the technological singularity right if a certain
group of humans developed the level of genetic engineering nanotech artificial intelligence
that we ourselves are going to have 20 years from now why didn't they raise the rest of humanity
up with them moreover why are they reaching back through time to very deliberately oppress and
manipulate more primitive societies well why don't we mess why don't we try to elevate those
uncontacted tribes well because every time we go around them and try to try to interfere with
what they're doing we get killed they shoot arrows at us sure sure but you know maybe they
should have shot more arrows at the british right in some of these places my point is that
that's that's a very beneficent motivation on their part meaning okay these are violent crazy
savages we don't want to get you know shot down by these people what fits the data if you look at
you know how various societies going back to the sumerians were governed is a much more explicit
and active agenda of manipulation and the the manipulation is geared toward setting up a
pyramidal caste society an extremely stratified society where you know the vast majority of people
are the base of the pyramid and then an ever smaller group of people represent higher rungs
until you get to those who serve the gods directly in india they call them the brahmin
and their purpose was to like directly interact with the devas and to carry out their directives
you know uh so that's what i see i don't see like you know i don't know whatever you know
rockefeller's son like getting like hunted by cannibal somewhere in some jungle and then they
decided better better that we don't go back down into that savage part of the world i see a much
more deliberate agenda of manipulation and so then the question becomes why why was that decision
made and by who to occult to secret away singularity level technology have a monopoly over controlling
it and not only leave the rest of humanity benighted but actively encourage their and reinforce
their ignorance right by by let's say engineering the collapse of the roman empire and the rise of
christianity so that we lose the library of alexandria and the whole knowledge base of classical
antiquity why do that and more over more over here's the really disturbing implication
if we are now at a point maybe 10 to 20 years away from the technological singularity
what are they going to do to stop that from happening because we have a global society
right now where the internet allows for a free flow of this kind of scientific and technical
knowledge across the planet if any one group of people achieves the technological singularity on
earth it's going to become a global phenomenon within probably days yeah right so my question
is this if they've gone to these great lengths to manipulate various societies throughout history
are we about to undergo a controlled demolition and a an engineered reset to prevent us from
reaching the technological singularity which would also give us a military parity with them it would
allow us to defend ourselves right against them right what do you think something like that would
look like i think that what happened during covid might be a test run of it in other words you had
a small group of people a policy planning elite
effectively shut down all of industry and basically sequester people within their homes
and garner unquestioning obedience from the vast majority of the population that would
be proof of concept for a much larger uh a much larger freezing of technical and industrial
activity across the face of the earth with any one of a number of excuses being used for why we
needed to basically halt all you know scientific technical research and why we needed to basically
vacate cities i mean think about this like our modern advanced industrial civilization is an
urban phenomenon if you were to engineer something like covid but far more virulent i mean something
that actually required a serious quarantine measures to be put into place it would become
almost impossible to live in cities nobody would want to live in them right so there would be a
mass exodus to the countryside and you would be laying the groundwork for a shift back to a kind of
neo agrarian feudal peasant lifestyle where people are close to the land again
right and they're not congregated in urban areas that also then become batteries for technological
and scientific research and development any number of things could be used in order to
create conditions for that an emp event could be used to do that right i mean think about
how functional cities would be or rather how dysfunctional how quickly dysfunctional they
would become if an emp were to take out you know the whole electric grid across large parts of the
planet there's a lot there but i feel like i feel like you are jumping to a lot of
really kind of out there conclusions like george bush being in contact with the aliens i mean i
understand your let me simply say this in response to that okay no one likes to point fingers and
name who it is that's actually doing whatever like you know insanely conspiratorial thing that
they imagine is going on in the world right it's always this unnamed they this this mysterious
cabal yes yes they my point is simply this that we would not have received this technology
from these nordics if we had not reached an agreement with them about how the technology
would be sequestered in what ways it would be used and how we were going to ensure that it doesn't
wind up in the public sphere who would have negotiated such an agreement who would have
been in position with the right clearances right to sit across the table from these people and
their people really we shouldn't call them entities their people uh well i mean he's a prime candidate
if you're going to go down a list of names so you know i mean why not and how would that not
have gotten out how would that how would no one on their death bed some you know
fucking general with like crazy you know nuclear secrets classified classified knowledge of all
these programs no one have ever mentioned any of this let me ask you think the human beings are
that capable of keeping a secret yes until now it's coming out now bit by bit it is coming out now
but here i'll answer your question this way in 1953 there were a whole bunch of newspapers
including the new york herald tribune which at that time was a prominent publication
that reported on aeronautical engineering efforts aimed at development of electro
gravitics or what we would call today's zero point energy mainstream news articles quoting the head
of martin aircraft which then became lockheed martin and today's lockheed uh bell was another
one con ver was another one and these executives chief executives of these companies were all
saying that the g engines are coming with cracked gravity and we are developing electro gravitic
propulsion that can get you from like new york to sydney australia in two hours and specifically
they said in 1953 that if we were given a budget comparable to that of the manhattan project we
could roll these things off the assembly line in a few years yeah was widely reported there was
also the wittons edward witton and um i believe edward was the son right louis witton and edward
witton i believe louis witton was involved in the this development yes right and then all of a
sudden everything went black well and and also coincidentally his son edward witton developed
string theory which misguided the physics community for an entire generation developed
string theory was a major one of the major people in development string theory yes which
then michio kaku and so forth became his lackeys and they diverted physics research away from
quantum gravity for an entire generation i think that's hardly a coincidence so anyway my point
is this though you're asking me how do you keep a meeting between let's say george bush senior
and a nordic secret yeah well i ask you how do you keep an electro gravitic propulsion program
and an entire physics knowledge based secret from the 1950s until the present
which of those is more insane how many generals were cleared on that how many generals since 1953
have known that martin aircraft or lockheed today has had uh you know vehicles that could go to mars
in short time and back i don't think the nuts and bolts thing the fact that we have secret
black technology in these aerospace that are being hidden by these aerospace companies
is that far is is more of a stretch than the fact that we have some sort of an agreement with an
alien race why they're not an alien not another race an advanced human race why would that be
that i just don't get it i mean i don't number one where would you have gotten this advanced
electro gravitic technology from it was reverse engineered craft so well we said it was ed the
witton ed witton and lewis witton were developing it in the 50s and somehow the government got to
engineering kept it black through reverse engineering in all likelihood i mean look
grush confirms the magenta crash took place in italy 1933 and then we had roswell here in 1947
by 1953 there had been a lot of time to analyze this wreckage and to you know reet reverse engineer
its basic propulsion principles right so the pilots of the craft are part and parcel of the
reverse engineering effort it's not like these are like unpiloted drones we're talking about here
this is technology from a civilization of people and these same people that are here on earth yeah
they're here on earth yeah look uh they're they're based here you're saying they're not based somewhere
else no and look it's clear more i think at least 50 percent of ufo's have been seen entering and
exiting the oceans right yes and so they're also called usos and well okay where are they coming from
i mean 70 percent of the earth's surface is water right yeah which has been mostly unexplored yeah i
go into this yeah something like five percent of the of the ocean surface has been unexplored so
just wrap your mind around that for a minute i'm with you it doesn't make any sense we have
detailed google maps of mars and five percent only of our own ocean has been explored why
who doesn't want us looking at the ocean floor in my book closer encounters there's a whole
section where i go into sub oceanic engineering that the united states has um researched and
developed in other words detailed blueprints for facilities that the us navy wanted to build
underneath uh subsurface mountain ranges mountain ranges on the seabed and inside the
continental shelves in case of a nuclear war with the soviet union uh between the 1960s and the 1980s
they developed many advanced concepts for building what you can't even call bases i mean they're the
size of small cities inside of ocean ridges if we have that level of engineering capability
underneath the ocean then what do you think these people have who are flying around in these saucers
right and clearly they're these saucers are seen exiting bodies of water all the time well they're
coming from vast submarine facilities sub oceanic facilities uh and this is also by the way completely
consistent with what we see in ancient myths too about you know like onanis and various beings
that they depict with like fish garbs coming from out of the persian gulf and other places
and interacting with people and bringing them various you know agricultural techniques and so
forth okay um one more thing about that danie you look at the sumerian myths you look at the greek
myths or the hindu epics these devas or anunnaki these so-called gods they're extremely human
in their behavior they're fallible they have all the same flaws we have they have the same
general behavioral patterns as we have uh another great body of lore that preserves this very um
adequately is the fairy folklore of the kelts the kelts called these beings the gentry there
were certain class of fairies and the way they're described i mean they're like people who are drunk
on power and extremely passionate and manipulative and can become very jealous and conniving they're
not anything very extraordinary you see and this is one of the things that we need to be disabused
of as this disclosure agenda unfolds is that there there are various factions that want us
to look at these entities as if they're either angels as if they have some kind of like divine
grandeur and grace or they're demons who are coming to like steal our souls that's what that's
that's where i wanted to get back to that's kind of like where we started with this i asked you
where that was coming from and you went to you started talking about jock valet yeah so why
are certain parts of our government and who are the ones that are trying to paint a narrative
of angels and demons yeah they're called the collins they're fucking tucker carlson of all
people is one of the people that believes this tucker you know i was extremely disappointed
and dismayed when i saw him buy into that narrative because he was one of the first people out in
front of the ufo story even i think maybe almost a decade ago when nobody else was reporting on
this subject he would have segments on fox about the ufo phenomenon and so i always respected him
as a journalist for no other reason for that right and then i watched as he started to cover the
disclosure uh process and i saw that this guy's been gotten to and it's not hard to see how he was
gotten to it's because he's a devout christian and there is a group called the collins elite they
the collins elite they are air force officers people in the navy defense intelligence agency
and a lot of people in the cia and i've had cia insiders tell me that this is the case
a lot of people in the cia and people from various branches of military intelligence
who come from a christian evangelical background
and they have become i think at least by the 1950s when morris jessup wrote this book called
ufo's and the bible they had become convinced that the phenomenon is of a peace with angelic
and demonic encounters that are recorded throughout the scriptural history of mankind
and that if the entities appear beneficent then they must be angelic and if they're doing things
that from whatever limited christian uh moral perspective these gentlemen have then they must
be demonic right and they've been able to influence a lot of the u.s. government's handling of uh
information regarding the phenomenon throughout the decades because they've penetrated all of the
intelligence services not just civilian intelligence like cia but all the military intelligence services
what became for me the more interesting question is you know how it all how it all started like
how you know when did these people get together like what first put it into their heads that this
was a demonic phenomenon and it goes back i think to the airship mystery of 1897 where across the
united states across something like i don't know 10 different states people saw these gigantic air
ships that were nothing like zeppelins now remember 1897 uh the the um what do you call them well the
airships the zeppelins hadn't been invented yet right and we didn't have airplanes and so these
people are seeing constructions in the sky that look like aircraft from out of jules verne novels
absurdly complex strange creatures is there like like i don't know there's probably not
is there photos yeah i mean you can there's renderings of them that appeared in newspapers
how can we what should he type in to find this 1897 airship mystery okay yeah airship mystery of
1897 okay there've been whole books written about it okay several good ones um and these were reported
on in tens of newspapers across the country the uh yeah try to find some of the newspapers see that
one's from the san francisco call there were huge sightings in 1896 late 1896 into 1897 across um
more than 10 states and they were reported in tens of newspapers including like the san francisco
chronicle major newspapers ran these stories on their front pages judges sheriffs lawyers doctors
the most prominent members of the community in some cases mayors of towns actually witness these
things from close up they would land in people's farms and ask for resupply and then fly away
and they were piloted by people not by aliens okay and when asked what these things were
the airship pilots would make claims like well um there is a a corporation in new york
that's going to be publicly introducing this invention sometime soon and you know there's
going to be like some great announcements and that that investors from new york were behind the
inventors of this airship so i pursued this whole line of research in my book closer encounters
one of the two books that i uh sent for you and in that book i made this argument that
there appeared to have been certain prussian industrialists meaning industrials from germany
of that time late 19th century germany prussian industrialists who were involved on the one hand
in airship engineering remember the germans invented the zeppelin later on and these industrialists
wanted to exploit resources in the americas they were after resource exploitation in the americas
and to make a long story short i did some research that provisionally led me to to
conclusion in that book that jp morgan and the haraman uh railroad industry in the late
19th century got in with these prussian industrialists and they began to engineer
and test fly these airships in the americas
so that's what i wrote about in closer encounters and i i suggested that that was the beginning
of the trajectory of technological research that eventually led to anti-gravitic propulsion
i really wonder whether that's the case i've i've since come to reconsider that uh that hypothesis
and this is all by way of explaining who the colons elite is okay so the more you look at these
reports from 1896 1897 the more they don't make any sense these people are seeing completely
different things on different nights the airships all look equally absurd none of them looks like
anything that could actually fly and the reports are all of different types of things different
shaped craft and sometimes people will just some people will just see a light like in san francisco
say one night some of the people who saw the thing saw a light others saw a structured craft
and it looked one way to one group of people and another way to another group of people
and the most disturbing element in this whole story is that the san francisco chronicle
tracked down the patent lawyer who claimed to represent the inventor of the airships the mystery
inventor of the airships right and this guy was a very prominent patent attorney he was named
george colons and they brought this guy in they got testimony from him about this inventor and
you know the nature of the airship technology and when it was going to be rolled out to the
public in all this right three days later george colons comes in and he did after reading the
story in the san francisco chronicle he says i never said those things they're like sir you
sat with us and gave us hours of testimony which we like wrote up he claimed to have been in a
trance the entire time that he recounted this to the san francisco chronicle and then they went
and tried to find the inventor that he claimed to represent and the guy was some i forget what his
first name was last name was benjamin and he was a dentist who specialized in making eventing
yet exactly and he specialized in inventing dental bridges but as his hobby he dreamed of making
airships okay so there's something weird going on here now people saw these things people touched
these things sheriffs and mayors interacted with the pilots of these craft but there's good reason
to believe that these were not structured objects in any sense that conventional physics understands
and the people's perceptions were being manipulated on a grand scale and that in at least one case
poor mr colons the patent attorney whose career was destroyed by this somebody was taken over
through a hypnotic trance or telepathic mesmeric trance as they called it in those days and he
was given a whole narrative to parrot to the san francisco chronicle now here's what i think
i'm going to give you one more piece of data before i um before i draw a conclusion here
in the sand it was either the san francisco call or the san francisco chronicle one of these
newspapers they also quoted uh okay so after colons this whole debacle with colons there's
another guy who stepped forward and claimed to be a patent attorney representing the airship
inventor and this second guy he also had a very significant pedigree i think he had a
background in the u.s military at a high level and he said the airships were being invented
to go fight the spaniards in cuba and that the reason they had been invented was because
there were people in the united states who didn't want who didn't want the cuban civil war to go
a certain way but they knew they couldn't get authorization from congress to have a direct
u.s military intervention in cuba so instead they were going to load this airship with all this tnt
and they were going to go over and drop it on havana and level the city he made this statement
newspaper so here's what i think happened the feds understandably concerned that there's maybe
some rogue group of airship people out there who are going to go level havana with tnt in the name
of us foreign policy started investigating this whole thing and they had all these tens of newspaper
stories to go on right and at some point i'm sure they had a nice long interview with mr colin's
the patent attorney who got subjected to some kind of telepathic hypnosis and my guess is that the
name colin's elite comes from that that it was all the way back in 1897 and in particular with
the case of mr colin's at the nexus of the airship mystery that they gave themselves this informal
unofficial name the colin's elite of people in the federal government at a very high level
who from a christian perspective were extremely concerned about this phenomenon because it appeared
to involve mass deception and manipulation and the apparent materialization of objects from
out of nowhere what we call apports and what people uh referred to as conjury throughout the
history of alchemy right so long story short i think that maybe already in 1897 by the way i wrote
an article about this it's called uh the mystery or no the airships of prometheus and it's on the
american colossus website american colossus dot org which is an organization i'm involved with now
there's an article i put up there called the airships of prometheus that goes into this whole
alternative hypothesis rival to the hypothesis i entertained in my book closer encounters
where basically i conclude that these gentlemen convinced themselves that satan was behind this
that satan was engaged in a mass manipulation and deception of the american populace using
the apparition of these airships and this is the beginning of the u.s government's interest in the
ufo phenomenon oh my god and this is why grush keeps saying when they ask him about 1933 so was
1933 the first and he says no no it goes way back even before that wolf tell us no i can't talk about
it well because he knows but he hasn't been cleared to talk about wow it seems like there's no cohesive
explanation in the government for this thing or no at least no cohesive plan it seems like it's
all just different factions with different ideas that are trying that have different objectives as
far as disseminating this stuff to the public unfortunately that's entirely consonant with
what i've experienced there's like three or four different factions they're all at odds with each
other and there's no grand plan that they all agree on so if there was hypothetically or you
believe that there is some sort of an agreement with a superhuman race and the our government
is going it has a plan to do some sort of a a slow drip disclosure to enlighten society about
this phenomena yeah they're not going to enlighten anybody i i am very skeptical of the slow drip
people and i can name names i can tell you who's behind i know who's behind the slow drip thing so
so if if there is this superhuman race that you talk about that exists here on the planet with
this technology that is so far advanced with by the way remember every time you say superhuman
think of like think of like super villains and superheroes right these are not you know
they're people and they have serious flaws right if they exist do they not have the power
to fix all the fuckery that's happening in our government so this is goes back to remember
earlier we were talking about the phenomenon having two different sources and one of them is
what you could legitimately refer to as non-human intelligence and how i was suggesting that if you
look at the various myths from the greeks to the hindus and so forth right okay it suggests there
are two factions yes and that one is a rebel faction right that's aligned with this non-human
intelligence so they want so the the chaos is a is a an effect of two different yeah a conflict
within this higher level exactly so the greeks called them the olympians and the titans yes these
are the two factions the hindus refer to them as the devas and the ashuras the ashuras are the
titans the devas are the olympians in sumerian myths it's the faction of enlil which are the devas
or the faction of enki which are the titans right all right i want to go there i want to go into
i want to go into your um your book about playto essay yeah long very long your essay about playto
and i want to touch on uh the promethean stuff i know we're we're really we're ripping through
this thing we're about almost three hours in so um but before before we transition into that
i want to ask you um do you know anything about chris bledso i know about the case why what are
your thoughts on on he is super interesting to me because he has the ability to film these lights
in the sky that move around they follow him wherever he goes he came here i mean steven went out to
the beach with him we sat in the beach for three hours and we stared at the sky and we filmed
these lights coming up out of the ocean in the far away near the horizon come up and we also
saw airplanes coming through the sky coming in to land into tampa there was a clear flight path for
the airplanes these were absolutely not airplane airplanes one of them came up out off the horizon
went left right and then like vanished we got it on film we showed it during the podcast i've seen
films of that and there's people in like cia according to him and in nasa according to him
that have been paying close attention to him visiting him and his family he's got photos with
these people one of these guys was one of the guys in diana persulka's book who is i don't
even i don't want to mention his name because his podcast got completely banned off youtube like
his it's unsearchable so i don't want to like have this podcast interview with him with chris
bledso no with this person whose podcast no no no no no okay chris talked about him extensively
so um i want to avoid mentioning his name i see um but anyways so these these very cryptic i mean
i know who you're talking about but we won't mention his name right these very cryptic people
who are involved in government intelligence are very interested in him sure what are your thoughts on
that he strikes me chris bledso strikes me as a very sincere person who is reporting what he
experienced as he as he experienced it uh the problem is that and you know this is something
that philosophers i mean people who do serious work in philosophy understand very well is that
our experience of phenomena is almost immediately filtered by our interpretive framework
based on whatever belief system has been inculcated in us probably from childhood and if i'm not
mistaken chris bledso comes from a conservative christian background and he's found some way to
try to integrate what he experienced with um the belief system that he was raised in and
the more disturbing thing is that i think that there's a group of people who've surrounded him
who are trying to manipulate that for their own purposes that they would like to develop a narrative
that's going to somehow shore up christianity in the face of any potential disclosure
and you know a ufo of god packaging for chris bledso's experience is very useful in that regard
so i don't fault him at all the guy's telling it like he experienced it right as best as he can
understand it based on his conservative christian background but i think that there are an awful lot
of powerful people who can't can't help but to seem impressive to somebody like him who when they
surround you you know and you're coming from where he's coming from you know they're able to to
significantly influence your interpretation of things and get you to play back into their narrative
right and so that's what i think is going on with him and it's not unique you know there's a long
history of the intelligence community not just in our country but also in various european countries
being involved with religious movements catalyzed by ufo encounters there were a bunch of these in
europe which joc valet talks about i think at some length in his book the one i mentioned earlier
messengers of deception there were all these ufo cults in europe and spain and italy were high
level government officials both of those catholic countries were involved with these ufo cults contact
decults with the intention of spinning the narrative in a way that was probably uh a contingency plan
to soften the impact of disclosure on the customary religion of their respective populations
and there's also stories like i'm sure you're familiar with paul benowitz sure who was seeing
those things off of i think he was in new mexico seeing those aircrafts off near there was like
an air force base right and he was very involved in the ufo community and then they had uh this guy
with richard dodie come out there and check out investigate see what he knew or if he had any
footage or photos of any of this and dodie drove him crazy and drove him crazy right he said oh i
think you're right i think these might be aliens and then used uh benowitz as a conduit into this
larger community of ufo believers or ufo enthusiasts because they knew that him he would be able to
poison the well with whatever dodie told him and because they also our government also believed
that the ufo community was penetrated by intelligence from the soviets absolutely and
by the way going back to the beginning of our conversation i wouldn't be at all surprised if
that's the kind of thing they were trying to do with me when this you know london or approaches me
and right off the bat says i'm the british head of the real society which was just according to these
you know researchers of nazi germany they say that the german interest in you know other worldly
beings and anti-gravity propulsion came from what was channeled by the real society so for all i know
their intentions were to get me to come forward as another like vehicle that they could control to
forward some disinformation campaign or something like that but it didn't work with me
okay so let's transition a little bit i want to talk about um some of the play-doh stuff but um
that's a huge subject to go it is a huge subject to cover in an hour but um you mentioned earlier in
the beginning of the podcast a guy named tom pain and can you can you explain
what he was talking about when he was discussing how christianity does not mix with the constitution
if you look at genesis exodus the book of joshua the image that you're presented with
of yaoi and of his prophets is of a tyrannical sadistic lord who is tasking warlords on the earth
like joshua to go carry out genocides in places like canaan this is the image that we're presented
with from the beginning off the bat in genesis here's a god lowercase g adrenai Elohim chief
chieftain of the gods who doesn't want us to have knowledge we're not allowed to eat
from the tree of the you know the fruit of the tree of knowledge
nor from the fruit of the tree of life which by the way i think is a symbol of probably genetic
engineering the tree of life in eden is probably symbolic of
cracking the genetic code and extending the human lifespan
and so this god why does he throw humanity out of eden going back to genesis he says himself
and by the way this is one of the places where you see where the text has been badly misinterpreted
from a polytheistic framework into a monotheistic framework because adrenai the chief guy yaoi
says to the other gods let us kick them out of eden because otherwise they might now having
eaten of the tree of knowledge also reach out and eat of the tree of life and then they will become
like unto us and nothing will be impossible to them in other words this is a jealous god well he
says so himself again in exodus when he's commanding moses to go murder all those women and children
for dancing and singing around a golden calf he says so i'm a jealous god don't what kind of god
is that i'm a jealous god don't worship any other gods besides me he says this as moses
comes down and sees the israelites repenting of having followed this lunatic out into the middle
of nowhere singing and dancing around the golden calf that they've set up which is probably a statue
of hathor they were coming from egypt right and hathor was the calf goddess uh cow goddess figure
right fertility goddess they're on the middle of freaking desert right right so they're setting
up a fertility goddess and they're dancing around it and he orders his lieutenants to go murder all
the women and the innocent children who were dancing around the calves together with whatever
men there were performing this right and y'all is perfectly fine with that what happens next
while moses doesn't make it to the promised land but joshua next in line of succession after moses
directly coordinates with the head of the lord's army this is in the scripture first of all i
they're carrying the ark of the covenant around right and everyone knows about
the parting of the red sea which by the way involves a cylindrical ufo it's very clearly
described in that incident in the red sea that what guided the israelites through the desert
through cyanide was a pillar in other words like a call a cylindrical kind of thing a pillar on its
side which looked like a pillar of cloud by day and glowed as a pillar of fire by night and it's
by the light of this object that the israelites are able to see the ground in front of them as
they navigate the cyanide and when they get to the red sea it's this thing hovering over the red
sea that parts the waters it's not like moses just said presto and the waters went aside no god says
now that this thing is floating over the red sea he says moses wave your wand and whatever
and it's the object that actually parts the waters the rest of the from a physics standpoint that
makes a lot of sense it just directed its anti-gravity beam downward and the water would have been
pushed to the sides of this channel you know and then the water was allowed to to come back in and
swallow the egyptian army as it attempted to pursue the israelites through the red sea
but where i was going with was this so they've got the ark of the covenant with them and after
moses dies and joshua takes over joshua is tasked by the commander of the lord's army this is the
phrase that's used in other words a guy who comes from one of these craft from the pillar or whatever
and meets secretly with joshua and tells joshua listen man this is the battle plan and the battle
plan involves the use of the ark to bring down the heavily fortified walls of jericho
so they go to jericho and they walk around the the the city's fortifications with this ark
and they're chanting something in this very harmonic kind of way this is a repetitious chant
and suddenly the walls of jericho its fortifications start to vibrate and then they crumble all at
once and what some researchers have suggested was that this is the use of a sonic resonator
as a weapon that the ark was some kind of at least one element of it was some kind of a sonic
resonator that and there is this technology where you can use sound waves to pulverize stone
so what happens when they go into jericho well they slaughter everybody
and they even kill all the animals and the only thing that they take is the loot the the gold
and silver and precious objects and the only people the person that they have mercy on is this woman
rahab prostitute who ratted out the people of jericho to the israelites what kind of ethics is that
and you see this over and over and over again in the various books of the old testament the
various prophetic books of the old testament and i think the point the point of all of this
is made very clearly in particular in the book of job where you have this poor schmuck who has been
extremely faithful to the lord never done anything wrong in his life been extremely charitable he's
a wealthy guy been extremely charitable to the rabbis and to the temple the religious institutions
and yet he's afflicted with all these horrible health issues right he's like gets gets this like
you know um horrible scabs and stuff all over his body and uh he he loses his wealth he suffers
misfortune after misfortune that brings him from a position of wealth to a position of
basically destitution and misery and him and his friends are basically sitting around and
they're arguing over what he could possibly have done to deserve this right being such a
righteous servant of the lord and in the beginning of the book of job there's this prologue where
basically satan says to god job is only faithful to you because you've been so good to him you've
blessed him so much if if you were to deal him out a life of misery even job would curse you even
the most faithful righteous man would curse you right and god says okay well let's test this theory
right and then what happens at the end of the book of job after job's gone through all of this
misery he still refuses to curse god um and and yet his friends are all making these excuses saying
look job you must have done something wrong because god is just and god would never treat a righteous
man like you in the way that you've been treated with all these misfortunes that have befell you
and god then appears to address the perceived insult that job's friends have hurled at the lord
and what's the perceived insult the insult of presuming that you as a human can set any standard
of justice upon god that you as a human can come to any judgment about when god is acting
ethically or unethically or why and in that passage the lord Yahweh essentially says to job
listen if you had a right hand as powerful as mine you could do these things to me but actually
i'm the stronger one and i don't need a rationale for my actions i'll do what i do to you and to
anybody else because i can because i'm the lord and that's the point of the book wow that's the
point of the book oh my god now tom pain is reading this stuff and then tom pain is reading jesus
in the gospels saying over and over again i'm the son of yahweh my father yahweh sent me
and at the end of the world i'm going to come back and i'm going to sit on the 12 thrones with
the elders of israel and i'm going to judge the whole world on behalf of my father yahweh
and not a dot of an i or a cross of a t of the Torah will pass out of existence or become irrelevant
until the judgment day meaning meaning i'll have grace on you i will forgive you for sinning
but you're still sinning the Torah the jewish law is still the law the law brought by moses
and the law of the law reinforced by all the patriarchs and prophets the law is the law
until the apocalypse i jesus i'm offering you grace and forgiveness on behalf of yahweh
so how i analyze this in my book closer encounters is that it basically fits what we call today in
in psychology and sociology stockholm syndrome it's when you're taken hostage or captive by a
sadistic tyrannical manipulator and you wind up identifying with your captivator you as a captive
are in a hostage situation where you're so terrified and subjected to cognitive dissonance
cognitive dissonance that you wind up actually coming up with justifications for the person
who's abusing you right like patty hearse you know being being taken captive by those leftist
guerrillas back in the late 60s right that's fascinating so this is why tom pain thought
that the bible wasn't compatible with the constitution because our entire constitution
is founded on individual liberty the sovereign self-determination of the human person right
our rational capacity to determine the course of our own lives and to become governors over
ourselves right and to treat each other ethically with respect as individuals in a society for
the sake of the common welfare i mean none of that is consistent none of that consistent with the
bible right period yep and he was uh you know straightforward enough to point that out now
when he was sentenced to death when he thought he was going to be guillotine sitting in a prison
in france he wrote that book the age of reason where he tears the bible to pieces i watched
your podcast with neil which was amazing on the ties or the link between um
um Platonism and Plato's noble lie and the formation of it's essentially modern religion right
and it seems like there's a i mean towards the end of the podcast he asked you the question he said
is Plato's noble lie the reason that we have religions today and that is it the reason for
christianity or islam or or any of this stuff and you said to him like that's the do you understand
how profound and terrifying this question is so obviously i got into reading Plato when i began
studying philosophy i agree with whitehead uh who said that the whole history of philosophy
consists of a series of footnotes to Plato still 2400 years later Plato is the single most fundamental
influence on the whole history of philosophy subsequent to himself i think he can rightly
be seen in a way as the founder of philosophy there are a group of pre-socratics we call them
thinkers who came before Plato who Plato himself is building upon but really philosophy gelled
as a human enterprise through the work of Plato and he's the first philosopher that thinks in a
really disciplined way in every domain or dimension of philosophical thought so we have ontology which
is the study of the nature of reality then you got epistemology which is the theory of knowledge
then ethics politics or political philosophy and then aesthetics which is not to be minimized at all
and i'm going to come back to it because it plays a significant role in Plato's thought
aesthetics meaning uh thinking about the nature of beauty and our perception of forms and uh
basically experience of the beautiful and judgments of taste okay in other words the
estimation of art of all the arts architecture music etc literature so you have these domains
of philosophy ontology epistemology ethics politics and aesthetics and before Plato
so you had various you know sages making kind of random remarks on various aspects of human
experience and what they believe the meaning of life in general was but you had no disciplined
inquiry into these distinct domains you definitely see that in Plato it begins with him then it's
really formalized in Aristotle right so let me just take the time for a moment to make the point
that i still very controversially adhere to that definition of philosophy in other words that a
philosopher is someone who has to think in all of these directions and who has to come up with
original concepts that cut across these various domains from ontology and epistemology to ethics
and politics and so forth why is that controversial it's been abandoned by almost the entire academic
establishment across uh both analytic philosophy and continental philosophy there are two different
schools today in philosophy one is a kind of anglo-american one more predominant in britain
and the united states that's called analytic and they're very into formal logic and the analysis
of scientific problems using logic the other is called continental philosophy which is more engaged
with what you know the average person would think of as the history of philosophy from Plato and
Aristotle to Kant and Hegel and Nietzsche and so forth and it's called continental referring to
the european continent right in both of these trends of philosophy and academia both of these
schools of thought the definition of the philosopher which i embrace has been completely rejected
they think that anyone who scribbles anything that has some relevance to i don't know maybe
um
an understanding of what matter really is you know what is matter really like that we're
dealing within physics like on an abstract conceptual level oh that person's a philosopher
anyone who writes about ethics let's say bioethics like how genetic engineering should be used maybe
to get rid of hereditary diseases but maybe not to enhance people right a bioethicist is a
philosopher i reject that completely right and the i reject rejected for a really good reason
not you know like based on some arbitrary you know personal fancy i reject it because
it's definitional to a philosopher not to take anything for granted going back to people like
Pythagoras and Socrates who were executed they were condemned to death by their societies the
philosopher is someone who questions everything from a fundamental level and builds up a whole
world view from out of reasoned argument and personal inspiration also but you know using
their rational faculty without accepting any presuppositions without accepting any conventional
views so unless you're thinking across all these different domains you can't do that if you're
let's say you're committed to use a controversial example let's say you're
committed to liberal democracy that's your political ideology but as a philosopher
you only want to do epistemology theory of knowledge you only want to work in the areas of
theory of knowledge and maybe to an extent ontology or the nature of reality and you're
working philosophies you want to understand what human nature is so you're very engaged with research
in biology right to do that you're engaged in cognitive science research to do that but it
just so happens you're a liberal democrat that's your political ideology which you're not questioning
and you don't do any work in political philosophy right the whole time that you're pursuing your
research and writing in the area of understanding what human nature is epistemologically and
ontologically you are going to ignore all empirical evidence that suggests that maybe
there are vast differences in IQ that are ethnically based from human population to human
population that human beings are grossly unequal and that let's say it might take genetic engineering
to somehow equalize humans in terms of their aptitude and their potential you'll reject all of
that because those bodies of empirical evidence challenge the liberal democratic ideology that
you're unconsciously committed to you see and you have no interest in actually thinking through
the foundations of political philosophy right makes sense see so that's why or let's say if you're
you want to do some work in you know theory of knowledge and look at you know look look at how
scientists are prejudiced by one or another uh political outlook when they marginalize certain
bodies of data which is like what thomas kuhn did in his book the structure of scientific
revolutions but let's say you also happen to be ethically committed to christianity that your
moral compass comes from christianity and it's unquestioned well that's going to taint how
you look at the history of the shifts in scientific paradigms you're not going to want to see how the
catholic church destroyed the knowledge base of classical antiquity or why the inquisition
was conducted right i was just talking to neil about this yesterday when i was asking neil because
i've been learning a lot more about this biblical history obviously if you saw the almond episode
that sent me down a fucking never ending rabid hellhole um but i was explaining him like
bible scholars isn't that a counterintuitive thing if you're if you're in if you look at it from a
scientific perspective you're admitting the bias like they're people that are religious
that their whole entire discipline is studying the the history of their religion it's like being a
a top level executive in the church of Scientology and being uh a science
Scientological scholar right but and here's the thing is that first of all you can't be scientific
right but to be a philosopher you have to be even more unforgiving to yourself than scientists
are because scientists take things for granted all the time first of all most scientists never
even question the paradigm that they're working in the context of they work on some small research
problems they write very highly focused journal articles right and that's their contribution
it's only the really great scientists the geniuses in the history of science who are often persecuted
who make discoveries that shift the paradigm but even those scientists are not asking themselves
questions about the nature of justice and you know how how to run a just society or even questions
about the ultimate nature of reality they might make some particular discovery in astronomy or
physics but they're not questioning the received narrative about the nature of the cosmos right
you see so a philosopher is burdened with asking those much deeper questions and with thinking in
all those directions and not taking anything for granted that's the definition of the philosopher
the Plato established and that I still adhere to and it's very unusual right okay so to go back
to Plato and your question about the noble lie actually we've paved the way for it because you
see in Plato's time the entire society took almost everything for granted and their worldview was
lock stock and barrel constituted by received customs and prejudices inherited from their
ancestors right you see this in Homer and he's Homer right yeah and Homer wrote about the Olympian
gods right and had all these they're all over Homer right they're all over Homer they they
interact with Achilles with various heroes very directly and but the more important point is this
is that the entire culture of Plato's time was an oral culture where you would memorize Homer from
childhood the way that Muslims in the Islamic world today memorize the Quran and your entire
matrix of perception was filtered through the way in which you had been hardwired by Homer by
memorizing Homer not reading it memorizing it an oral culture why why wouldn't you be able to read
it they didn't read they couldn't read they were illiterate people okay only very small group of
people could read in Greece so the rise of philosophy and then by extension of science
is contemporaneous with the rise of a literary culture because when you write something down
you can analyze it it's not going into your cognitive structure in a way that hardwires you
to filter all of your experience through the customs through the exemplars that are embedded
in this mythic and epic narrative right you don't have any capacity to take a step outside of the
narrative and analyze it because it's not on a text in front of you it's just you're being like
brainwashed by it from childhood right which is what happens in the Islamic world like I said today
still with the Quran all these kids in the Islamic world these madras says they memorize the Quran
from childhood it becomes the fundamental basis for their interpretation of everything else in life
so Plato is dealing with this kind of a society right and what's in Homer looting pillage murder
Zeus himself as a serialist all he does is manipulate people and you know engage in R&R by
disguising himself as various animals and going down and mortal women right so what kind of a
moral example does this set for young Greeks who are being raised in that kind of an oral culture
Plato recognized that there was a need to restructure society on the level of the fundamental
folklore and the deepest religious beliefs that condition the human person right so he says in
Republic among other texts we don't really know what happened in distant prehistory we have these
folkloric accounts we have these myths that Homer has composed into a coherent narrative
and we could spin them in any number of other ways than the way in which they're being narrated by
Homer and we could do that in a manner that would be more conducive to cultivating the ethical
fabric of the individual so that you know Agamemnon and Zeus and whatever other tyrannical you know
brutalizing gods patriarchs and gods are not the role models for Greek children
and we can do it in a way where we also slowly carefully cultivate man's rational capacity
so he says that it's incumbent upon philosophers to devise a new religious belief system
for the sake of the betterment of society and to rewrite the folklore of society
and restructure the educational system in a way where people will be guided away from
this extremely disempowering and you know deranging narrative
he wanted society to be set up in a way that was more progressive that would enable us to
evolve and he thought you couldn't do that in a forthright manner
for a good reason because first of all he saw Socrates his own mentor get executed by the
democratic assembly of Athens what was the charge disbelieving in the gods of the state
and inventing new gods that was the charge that Socrates was executed for disbelieving in the
gods of the state inventing new gods and thereby corrupting the morals of the youth that's why
they sentenced him democratically to death so Plato is seeing the majority do that in Athens
after the death of Socrates Plato went and joined the Pythagorean order
the order that Pythagoras had set up a generation before him almost two generations before him
Pythagoras same thing happened to him right or he got burned alive or something yeah well
so Pythagoras had been thinking to carry out these reforms in the society of Sicily ancient Sicily
and for example he wanted to create schools where women could enroll as students and they
could even become teachers and he also taught things that flew in the face of conventional
Greek religion like for example reincarnation what the Greeks called methampsychosis or what we
call reincarnation most people are familiar with it in America on the basis of Hinduism or Buddhism
but actually Pythagoras was teaching that and various esoteric Greek societies were teaching
about methampsychosis as well but it flew in the face of the conventional Olympian religion
which was that you know after death you go down to Hades right so the aristocracy of Sicily
revolted against Pythagoras they rallied the mob like you know in those Frankenstein movies where
they come with torches basically and they came with torches to the Pythagorean schools and burned
them down and Pythagoras either died right then and there or he died from the burns he sustained
in that fire shortly thereafter so Plato joins the Pythagorean order and now he has not only
the example of Socrates condemned to death by the majority in Athens but also the precedent of
Pythagoras and his schools having been burned down so he has to tread lightly tread well tread
lightly he has to be deceptive for a noble purpose which is to re-engineer society on a folkloric
level in order to give people a religious belief system that works with images and symbols that
they're familiar with not something completely outlandish that they can't connect to at all
something that's going to use language that they would be conversant with but that's going to
reorient their development in a way that you know reaffirms the rational faculty of the human
individual and ultimately jump starts science and a more you know enlightened society so that's
the idea basically of the noble light he introduces it in the context controversially of a eugenics
program that he that he thinks would be beneficial for society Plato's the father of eugenics the
first person to suggest selective breeding among humans rather than just selective horse breeding
or selective dog breeding or whatever or selective cultivation of plants the first person to take
that idea of selective breeding and apply it to human populations was Plato where he suggests
in republic that in the ideal society not just anyone should be allowed to marry anyone because
you're going to wind up with imbeciles and retards and you know especially the higher rungs of society
should have a good genetic stock including you know significant cognitive capacities
he introduces the discussion of the noble lie in the context of his proposals for the eugenics
program because he also thinks that you're going to have to be careful how you introduce such a
program to the general population and basically you have to sell it to them in the right way
so that's where the term noble lie is first used but the much bigger example of the noble lie and
the one that is more central to my work uh it's a greater interest to me and it cast a longer
shadow over history is this idea that we need to come up we the philosophers need to come up with
a new religion that's going to be more conducive to the cultivation of the individual and of human
rational faculties and the philosophers conveniently wanted to be at the top of that pyramid well
because they're the only free thinkers and they are in danger of being martyred by the rest of
the ignorant rabble who want to persecute and ultimately execute anybody who deviates from
custom and questions established traditions including for example for the sake of giving
women equality right one of the fundamental proposals of Plato's republic is that women
should be not just uh you know afforded equal opportunities in education they should also
be equal represented equally represented in the political system so among the philosopher rulers
of the society were these female philosophers which is why it's wrong to call them philosopher kings
it's a bad like translation from out of republic they're philosopher rulers or solvents including
women and that was considered insane in his time right it's an extremely progressive outlandish
policy heretical yeah so who if they if the philosophers like played out were the ones at
the top of the society calling all the shots um was the idea that there would be a like a
a round table of geniuses that would keep each other in check or would they be aware of the
corruption of power and number one round table so there's no king there's a chairman of a round
table it's like king arthur in the nights of the round table which is a whole other conversation
we can have sometime i've written about that too uh it's a round table but then interestingly
they're also not allowed to have bank accounts the philosophers aren't yep the people who run
society are not allowed to even own any private property they cannot have a personal bank account
to prevent from corruption he makes it so that no one who's avaricious no one who's a greedy person
or someone who's a power seeker would even want to be in this position
also by the way he says that you're not allowed to get married there's no one-on-one marriages
because you'll you'll be corrupted just out of love for your wife you'll put your wife and your
children first your own children so he says no the philosophers they can all have sex with each other
and we won't know who's who's child and is it also true that they were just like having sex
guys were having like there was no distinguish between homosexuality no that's actually not
true and that's not true no and i heard that in your interview with amon and it came up again in
your conversation with neil yeah and it's not true and i don't know where these guys are getting
this from there were extremely strong stigmas against homosexuality in greek culture there was
a lot of homosexuality in greek greek culture no question about it but there were also rants against
it from very prominent intellectuals including vociferously from Aristotle but many intellectuals
talk about it and how it's not right and it's corrupt and it goes against nature and stuff like
that who said that though who who where did you read that one of the most prominent intellectuals
in the period of Plato was a guy called isocrates not to be confused with Socrates isocrates he was
a sophist he rants against it Plato himself i hate to say because i do love Plato but
in his late book the laws when he kind of became a stodgy old man his final work the laws Plato
proscribes homosexuality prescribes it proscribes he bans it oh he bans it yeah even Plato and people
say Plato was gay some people say Plato himself was gay i don't buy i think probably he was bisexual
but in any case in his late work in the laws when he's he's much less of an idealist than when
he wrote republic and he's now gone through all kinds of misery including an attempt to change
the regime in Syracuse where you know he had to flee Syracuse three times in in the course of
trying to turn this tyrant there Dionysus into you know this ideal philosopher king that he envisages
in republic to use Syracuse as a testing ground for his theory right and so he's gone through all
this misery and at the end of his life when he's an old man he writes this book the laws
and even Plato himself in there writes against homosexuality and why it should be banned and
then Aristotle vociferously is against it so there's a whole greek intellectual class
that's critiquing that as something corrupt and like against nature so i don't know so why would
someone like Amon who's read probably more ancient greek than anyone on the fucking face of the earth
why would he say something like that because he's prejudiced look everybody looks at things
i would like what he's saying to be true i would prefer that greece right where you know there
aren't these extremely rigid sexual moors and so on and so forth and that was true of the mystery
cults so he's right there and his focus is the mystery cults the the allusinian mysteries and
and uh rites of Dionysus and you know um various cults the cult of Artemis and so on and so forth
where the people who were initiated into those societies did not adhere to customary morality
in secret how important do you think that these mysteries of a these sacred rituals involving
drugs how responsible do you think those were for the explosion of intellect during that time
i would say that uh Amon overstated it it might have been a factor but a much larger factor
was the rise of literacy because like i was saying earlier when writing is developed as a technology
you get to reflect on a narrative in a way that you don't if you're memorizing it it sits there
outside of you and you can read it and reread it and stop and take notes on it so the rise of a
literary culture is very important there's another huge factor which i um point to in my first book
Prometheus and Atlas and that was the rise of drama in the generation of escalus you had the
Greek theater emerge as an art form for the first time right and i make this argument in Prometheus
and Atlas that the fact that these Greeks were sitting in different seats in the amphitheater
to watch plays on various nights allowed them to comprehend perspective for the first time
so to begin with i mean this is very hard for us to wrap our minds around because
you know it's become so second nature for us but think back to that time there was nothing
like theater whenever there were performances they were religious rituals where you were part
of the performance you are playing the role of a god or a hero or something yourself in a ritual
context you were never sitting in the stands and watching a play be performed outside yourself
moreover the Greek theater is semicircular and so depending on how rich you were or how much
money you had for a ticket that particular evening you'd either be sitting in you know
some crappy seat up here in this corner or you'd be sitting near the stage down here in this corner
right and so on different evenings you're getting a different perspective on the action
do you think it's a coincidence that shortly after theater arises as an art form we get
photorealistic Greek sculptures that the Greek sculptures before theater are these rigid things
that look like second rate Egyptian or Babylonian sculptures and then suddenly within a generation
of escalus within a generation of people sitting in semicircular amphitheaters and having perspective
on the action we get true to life Greek sculptures they discovered perspective and when you combine
the discovery of perspective also perspective in a psychological sense where you're watching the
dramas in other people's lives unfold on the stage and it makes you reflect on yourself for the first
time from a third person perspective right you start to think damn that's that's me i've been in
situations like that look how that character is going through this and that and you start to reflect
on your own life that way and they're experiencing this before they can actually even read stories
yes and at the same time the culture is starting to become literary so you take the rise of literary
culture and the perspective that was inculcated in the population through drama and theater as an art
form beginning with escalus and i think the two of them together produced this mutation in cognition
mm-hmm drugs may have also been a factor but i think it's it's been overstated
do you believe in god no not only do i not believe in god i think that the belief in god is extremely
deleterious it's probably the worst thing that anyone could do for himself uh and the reason
has to do with free will right so now we're what are we almost three and a half hours in
and this is extremely central to my work um and so it really requires a much more dedicated
discussion but i will try to condense it okay okay let me know if you're not following me okay all right
so first of all god capital g
you know indistinction from the gods that we've been talking about right indistinction from gods
titans angels demons god capital g that would be like zeus no that's a god that's a god okay i thought
i thought zeus was like the no god we don't have god capital g until christianity in the west
they don't have it in oh they don't have it in the middle east until islam so we're talking like
we're talking like ad we didn't have a god with a capital g that might be a fair argument you
might say india had a god a little bit sooner than that okay and so far as brahma or brahman
rather brahman um is a supreme being beyond all the devas the devas or gods are subordinate to
some supreme being brahman who's considered like the macrocosm he is considered a mind that encompasses
all of cosmic order and he's also said to be reflected or mirrored in the microcosm of the
atman so they say in you know vedanta and hindu mysticism that your truest innermost self is god
god is your truest innermost self and vice versa the macrocosm is the micro got it yes make sense
brahman atman okay gotama buddha completely deconstructed that by the way he argued that
there's no god capital g and he argued that there's no self either what reincarnates re and by the way
they don't use the term reincarnation in buddhism in the buddhidharma they use the term rebirth
because they think that what gets reiterated from lifetime to lifetime is basically software code
it's like what we would today consider a software code which can be copied okay and it can it can
also um there can be bugs in replication and it can change as it's copied and it can be recoded
right because gotama buddha in very much the same way that i'm going to lay out right now
thought that um it's a dangerous delusion to believe either in a permanent immortal soul
or in an eternal supreme being so here's one of the reasons why it's a dangerous delusion
god capital g is definitionally an omniscient and omnipotent being god is all-knowing and all
powerful right i mean you've heard that i'm sure a million times would you stop and think about
that for a minute if god is all-knowing god already knows everything that's going to happen in the
future right yeah okay well where is god's mind accessing if god knows future events
what is being represented in the mind of god when god thinks about
any and all events that are going to happen in the future the future right god is accessing god
with his omniscient mind is accessing the future as an existing state of affairs whenever he wants
to know what's going to happen a million years or a billion years from now meaning the future
already exists for god that makes sense right yes meaning the future already exists meaning it's
already written or does he create the future if god creates the future now we're talking about
god's omnipotence okay where god is considered by any religious person to be the power behind
anything that happens in the world yes and the gloron expresses this very eloquently where it
talks about how like even a single leaf doesn't fall without the power of god being behind it
mm-hmm so it's absolute fatalism in the sense that everything that happens in the world and
everything that you do that you think you do everything you're under the illusion of having
chosen to do yourself is actually an expression of the power of god moreover god knows in advance
everything that you're going to do meaning that everything that you're going to do
that you think you have any choice over is already foreordained meaning you have no free will
you see mm-hmm you are like a ventriloquist dummy so an immediate consequence of belief in an all
knowing and all powerful being is the negation of your own free will which i consider to be the
worst thing conceivable and the most disempowering because if you don't think that you're responsible
for your actions and that you are the agency behind what unfolds in your life at least to some
degree right i mean we have all kinds of things that supervene that you know that influence and
impact our decision-making all kinds of things psychological factors going back to our childhood
yeah biological factors right but our even pursuing a certain line of thought let alone
like carrying out an action depends on admitting that we have some intentionality recognizing
that we have intentions that we carry out by pursuing a line of thought or deciding to act
in a certain way whatever other factors supervene on it that fundamental intentionality is a
prerequisite of even making sense out of human life moreover any criminal justice system is
nonsensical without it right i mean what sense does it make to hold somebody ethically responsible
for something if they had no free will right in in i don't know uh mutilating a child or whatever
right i mean so there are horrendous consequences in terms of personal agency
and ethical responsibility as soon as we accept the idea that there's an all-knowing and all
powerful god yet this is what majority of society in america believes today it's what the majority
of europeans still believe although christianity is declining in europe uh the slack in in belief in
christianity in europe is sadly being um mitigated by a rise of belief in islam in europe
and it's certainly what the whole islamic world believes so the vast majority of people on the
planet and by the way the hindu's also believe this because as i was suggesting earlier the idea of
brahman and the mirroring of brahman in the atman the mirroring of the macrocosm in the microcosm
fits within the same basic structure of omniscience and omnipotence that's attributed to god or to
allah in the christian and islamic worlds it's essentially the same despite the other differences
in their belief systems so the vast majority of humanity subscribes to a religious belief
that negates the value and purpose of the human individual
why would that be the case how could this have ever come about right that's a good question yeah
well if you intend to enslave and brutalize a population it would be very beneficial to make
them believe that they're entirely at your mercy and that on an individual level they are nobody
and nothing you see yes so as a cognitive dissonance mechanism as a gigantic brainwashing
and conditioning machination it makes perfect sense if somebody wants to enslave and control us
to inculcate this belief in god almighty across the entire planet and then to say any entities
that might come down and interact with you are emissaries they're angels evangelists right
they're emissaries of the one god so then these ufo pilots can portray themselves as agents
of the almighty god which you are utterly powerless to resist
resistance is futile that's their mantra i reject it absolutely
that's fucking terrifying yeah
but there's a resistance and there always has been yeah this is why the symbol of
Prometheus is central to my work because of all the rebel figures enki among the Sumerians
Quetzalcoatl among the Mayans satan in the Judeo-Christian and Islamic context the rebel
figure against the divine order the rebel figure against the god father tyrant that is most complex
and most empowering as an archetype with which we can identify as individuals is Prometheus
the Greek account of that um rebel against the divine order is so much richer and more
sophisticated than the ones that we get from any of the other ancient cultures Prometheus is the one
that wanted to save humanity from Zeus right you well Prometheus is to begin with the creator
of humanity so one of the things that comes across from the myth of Prometheus is that this uh
overlord Yahweh Zeus whatever is a liar when he says he's the creator of humanity
Prometheus created humanity and Prometheus wanted humanity to be a race of new gods
but then this overlord Zeus whatever you want to call him Yahweh enslaved this new race
and was intent on keeping knowledge away from this this this class of beings and using them as
chattel essentially and so Prometheus steals the light of knowledge he's the light bringer the
Lucifer he steals the light of knowledge and the fire of the forge and gives that to humanity in
other words he gives humanity the capacity for scientific research and technological development
but also for greatness in the arts and crafts and Prometheus also his son in the Greek myths
Prometheus the son Dukallion is the one who saves humanity from the flood when Zeus brings
this deluge to destroy Atlantis so if you think about it the biblical version makes no
sense at all if Yahweh decided to flood the world to destroy the civilization of the demigods the
rebel fallen angels who created this race of giants right essentially the Atlanteans if Yahweh
decided to wipe them all out by flooding the earth why is Yahweh asking Noah to save anybody
it makes no sense it sounds like a story that's been rewritten in the Greek version
it's the son of Prometheus who goes against Zeus and schemes to save some portion of humanity
and restart civilization after the flood Prometheus's son was the original Noah yeah Dukallion
and he's like this Quetzalcoatl civilizer figure who goes around trying to restart agriculture
Christianity said that Prometheus was Lucifer exactly exactly and this is the devil
yes and this was well known look Diabolos just means the the the contradictor or the one that
that is an opposition yes creates dissonance right and the word shaytan means the adversary
so these are both epithets Diabolos or shaytan just means the one who's against someone else
well yeah Prometheus is against the whole olympian order right and he's for humanity
and that Prometheus is Lucifer was well known by the modern writers who reappropriated the symbol
of Prometheus beginning in the 1700s when you had people like Percy Shelley who wrote this poem
Prometheus Unbound or Lord Byron yes or Mary Shelley who wrote Frankenstein
it was known to all of these people that Prometheus is Lucifer and like for example in
was that the Lord Byron's cane mystery yes yes and in Percy Shelley's Prometheus Unbound
it's interesting how he uses all the roman names for the gods so he'll say Jove instead of Zeus
and Jupiter or he'll say Venus instead of Aphrodite or he'll use Mercury instead of Hermes right
but when he comes to Lucifer he uses Prometheus instead or he rather he doesn't translate the
name of Prometheus into its latin equivalent because he would have to use Lucifer and oh wow you
see so he uses all this is a hint he's leaving he uses all roman latin names except for Prometheus
himself because Prometheus translated culturally translated into a latin context Lucifer he's the
light bringer and the rebel against heaven wow do we just become satanists my problem with that
and I've considered it by the way I've considered just like going with a branding like that see
but the thing is it's been so warped by Christians yes and one of the reasons why I decided to
let's say package my philosophical project in terms of the archetype of Prometheus is because
first of all it predates Christianity it's not dependent on Christianity no Prometheus was the
rebel against the overlords for 500 years at least before Christianity the first writing that we have
about Prometheus is the tragedy of Escalus which is about 500 BC so we know for sure that Prometheus
was you know a significant figure in Greek culture for half a millennium before the rise of Christianity
so I'm not then defining myself negatively against Christianity right to hell with Christianity
we're for Prometheus right maybe that also means we're against Christianity
but it's not a negative definition the way that satanism is right and then you have the whole
carnival culture of satanism today going back to this this charlatan grifter um what's his name
Anton Leve in the 1960s and the guy was a charlatan grifter and he just appropriated all this really
tacky imagery from I don't know vampire movies and like yeah watered down gothic medieval uh you
know phantasmagoria and and built himself this ridiculous he bastardized it cult you know which
is like as as much a money laundering scheme as Scientology right so I don't want to be associated
with that I mean that's not that's not what I mean by satan my satan my shaytan or diabolos
is Prometheus and what does Prometheus mean his name means forethought Prometheus means forethought
and see this also connects my appropriation of the symbol of Prometheus with my Iranian heritage
because in the religion of Zarathustra the ancient religion of Iran the supreme deity
is called Ahura Mazda or the titan of wisdom and remember Prometheus wasn't a god he was a titan
so Ahura Mazda is called the titan of wisdom and the chief quality the primary attribute of Ahura
Mazda is sepan taminu or the forward thinking mentality the mentality of progress or the spirit
of progress at work on a cosmic scale and Ahura Mazda defined by his sepan taminu by his Prometheus
is not an omnipotent or omniscient deity he is a a force that catalyzes and fosters evolution
and he needs humanity to help him to turn the world into a paradise so so and and Ahura Mazda
is symbolized by fire by an ever-burning fire so actually I've written at great length about how
the cult of Prometheus in Greece and the Zoroastrian religion have a common Indo-European origin
that they came originally from the same society let's say which was based somewhere in the Caucasus
Jason I think that's a great way to wrap this podcast up man we covered a ton of ton of shit
yes we did thank you for your time and where can people get in contact with you learn more about
you find your books your writings all that stuff yeah I have a website but I actually think that
the best thing to direct people to is probably my ex-account so it's Prometheus Prometheusm
it's a contraction of Prometheus and Theism Prometheusm at Jason Giorgiani Jason underscore
Giorgiani is my ex-account okay and I'm gonna put more of my focus there you the youtube channel as
well right yeah yeah but I regularly post things from my youtube channel on to my ex-account okay
but yes the youtube channel is also called Prometheusm okay it's a Prometheusm channel is this your
new book right here yeah philosophy of the future is my newest book hold up hold it up like right
here yeah all the side of you okay right so philosophy towards this camera okay philosophy
of the future is not just my newest book cameras everywhere it's also a kind of grand synthesis
of all of my work so you could read this book either as a general introduction to my entire corpus
or as a kind of summary conclusion okay so really I would suggest not for the faint of heart really
but I would suggest that people who are interested in my work should start there if they haven't read
anything else from me awesome man um thank you man I really appreciate it thank you and for everyone
listening before we recorded the show we did an exclusive patreon q and a where the people on
patreon got to ask Giorgiani some uh interesting questions and we talked about that for about
30 minutes so if you want to check that out it's linked below on patreon good night folks
