There is something here the engineer is just like you know what this wall needs
right here and there's a matching face a complex curve of the block twist it's
almost like that it's twisted twist in it you again you see all the same marks
scoots right it's the same but I love this you know the idea of the story is
like this is this is your trench Johnson take your back take your pounding
stone this is where you work yeah and so each guy just sits here for his entire
life entire life and digs I've drawn a line down the corner and you'll notice
that that giant block goes around the corner oh my god like you're showing
off then you go in with your magic granite flattening tool whatever that is
and you remove all that granite now you have four blocks that go around corners
I think part of our thing is like we have no idea
snake bros wait how do you guys do your intro ladies and gentlemen brothers and
serpents angels and demons that's right welcome ladies and gentlemen boys and
girls angels and demons and monsters and serpents this is brothers of the
serpent we are on the Danny Jones podcast this has been a long time coming
fellas yes I'm psyched to have you guys in here today glad to be here thanks for
having us so yeah thank you for helping me solve my audio issues just now we
just for the last 30 minutes talking about audio problems Kyle is a wizard I
love the studio thank you this is great thank you I'm jealous of your of your
wall back there I want one of those the foam blocks I got some extras I can give
you guys but fly home with this giant bag so I need you guys to tell me what
you guys know I know you guys have the secrets well let's see should we start
with should we start with how where we come from on this stuff yeah okay yeah
well how did you guys start your podcast tell me tell me the whole origin of the
snake bros okay so the beginning of the investigation into this kind of mystery
happened because we actually got into an accident what was it so 2002 yeah one
or two I think it was 2002 yeah so basically we it was a really really bad
car accident before that we were just rocker you know we were rocking and
rolling playing music we were actually in the car accident happened because we
were coming back from a band practice late at night and but this guy was drunk
and he just came over on to our side of the road and we we had a head on
collision at 60 miles an hour so it was it was really bad it broke my back did a
whole bunch of other damage to me the cars burned to the ground bullets were
flying everywhere because we in Texas and we had ammo in the car yeah the cops
and the you know the the the fire the fire trucks they all had to leave and
everybody had to hit the deck because it's like because the car was on fire
yeah the car started burning and then the ammo started going off and we had all
of our guitars and amps in there too and they burned yep it was terrible yeah so
then I spent a long time in the hospital in recovery you know and it was one of
those deals where they're like well you may never walk again all this kind of
stuff because my spine had basically exploded my lower back the L3 vertebrae
was a burst fracture into 27 pieces and Kyle had a bunch of damage to he was
driving I was in the front passenger seat so the seat belt cut me from you
know my upper right shoulder all the way down to my hip like I like I got cut
with a sword so broke my clavicle ribs you know all the way down so I was
really damaged and then so then I was in recovery for a long time hobbling with
a cane couldn't really go anywhere couldn't really do anything and after I
had like read every fiction book I had again and played every video game I had
again I started just I was like I just want to you know I want to read some
interesting mysterious stuff and I started going online and just looking
up you know let's let's check out the pyramids let's look at ancient
civilizations like I know there's mysteries involved in this and then I
started to understand like holy crap there's there is a lot of fascinating
stuff that I've never really been aware of just in this stuff you know just the
first time I saw the interior diagram of the great pyramid and you understand
that most of this huge stone triangle doesn't seem to have anything in it
there's just these passage these passageways and these little rooms and
you're like they built this entire thing and that's all that's inside there
maybe there's other stuff you know so I started getting interested in that I
started looking at out-of-place artifacts just objects that people have claimed to
have found or have been found in places where they shouldn't be you know that so
something that might imply transatlantic trade a long time ago you know some
people have you know coins very ancient coins in the Americas you know so so it
would be in a time where supposedly there wasn't nobody was making coins or
even using metal right just stuff like that and then you know Kyle and I are
hanging out and I'd start going to him and tell him like dude have you seen this
inside of the pyramid you know have you looked at this like so Kyle what happened
to you during that accident how did how fucked up did you get it was mostly
whiplash and but I mean I was suffering from like a lot of pain and I was going
to all these doctors had MRIs done did physical therapy and I'm trying to you
know they were trying to figure out why am I in so much pain did your spine
explode too no no broken bones wow yeah were you wearing a seatbelt or no yeah
you were you but you didn't have the seatbelt cut like no well see what
happened to him is one of the big amplifiers in the back flew up and hit
his seat oh just shove the whole seat forward yeah so he had it you hence the
seatbelt yeah he hit the brakes and you know that your seatbelt locks so I'm
sitting back when the seatbelt locks and then this giant speaker stack hits the
back of my seat and jams it forward and the seatbelt was locked so it just cut
me you know yeah but yeah basically yeah it's we're still dealing with all that
yep it's how long did it take you guys to like get back on your feet and like
start moving around normally for me it was just it was literally like a week
and then I was back at work and we were you know we were working on land
development so it's hard labor out so outdoors but he had long-term tissue
damage that no one was really aware of that's what I'm saying like within a
month I couldn't hardly move yeah so you know how whiplash will affect you you'd
be like I'm fine yeah and then two or three days later you're like oh my god I
can't sit up yeah hit so like one of the things that we've that we found out later
with him is he had he had his foot right foot slammed on the brake when the
impact happened and that jolt went up his leg hyperextended his knee hit his
hips and twisted it and that entire twisting motion went all the way up his
spine and into his neck and did tissue damage all the way up you know it just
it takes a long time to yeah it's fast it's basically like they call it
arthritis because when you get a severe injury to the spine or to to your bones
like just not severe injury so much as like just something real hard on it like
bull riders get this they get like an early onset arthritis mm-hmm called
traumatic arthritis that's what I got in the spine right but it was almost
instantaneous it begins from that moment so yeah but I remember you know I once
still climbed through a pyramid though yeah still time through a pyramid it
hurts a little more than it should but you can still we can still do it yeah I
mean we went you know eventually we were going snowboarding again you know
eventually yeah which is it's you know it's everything is harder yeah right
you're not nearly as don't take as big a chances yeah before which is kind of
good yeah it's like maybe I shouldn't jump off yeah I probably shouldn't try
that jump on my snowboard anymore and then and then you guys get rear-ended on
the way to the podcast yeah that was awesome yeah yeah I was this is the
thing I'm holding my phone like this we're looking for a restaurant and we
get rear-ended it just flies out of my hand it just hits me in the face like
dude okay yeah even a passenger you shouldn't be holding your oh my god yeah
yeah I think that the that person that was behind you was probably a plant
following you CIA plant because yeah we got a show everybody my father-in-law was
driving down the beach this morning right five minutes away from here and he
sends me photos of Mobile Tactical Operations Center for the US Space
Force it looks like the Star Trek emblem yeah Mobile Tactical Operations Center
for US Space Force Space Force is here it looks like a nice van like I wonder if
somebody just bought that van it just did that the fuck with people or if
that's for real it could be I mean I mean that's pretty if you were Space Force
though I would you want to be so blatantly out in the open like that
just slowing on the beach I don't know maybe maybe they're proud of being maybe
they have nothing to hide yeah they're fucking installing the rods from God so
you guys are you started reading books started getting into all the science
fiction stuff yeah and then at what point did you guys come up with the idea to
start a podcast well after I mean after years of us sort of taught we had long
you know we're brothers so we wouldn't have these long conversation I'd go
down to his house and hang out or we're just hanging out with friends and
drinking some beers and we would just have these long involved conversations and
we started to develop a kind of sort of an alternate were or possible alternate
ways of looking at this stuff you know and then we would just have these
amazing conversations about it and I was like and then I started getting into
podcasts as well I was listening to them and and I I started telling Cal
like dude we could do this you know like these guys there's all these different
podcasts that are discussing this kind of stuff I think we have something to add
to the conversation and I want to be part of this conversation I want to talk
to these people as well yeah and then the other great thing about having a
podcast is you can kind of be just a random person but you can invite
scientists and doctors and experts and you know and thinkers onto your show to
talk to you and they'll come and do it right whereas if you're just like well
I don't have any I just want to can I just call you scientist and talk to you
about some science stuff and they're like I'm busy but if you have a show
they'll come and talk to you maybe right so we talked about podcasting for I
don't know couple of months maybe six months and then finally Kyle was like
look I he already had all the equipment I already had a studio yeah cuz you know
musician right so he's like well I got a studio I got the mics I got the all the
software we need he said you set up the internet side of it whatever it is you
need to do to get a podcast going and then once you tell me like everything's
ready to go and we can publish the first show then we'll record one right so I
did that I got I built I made an RSS feed and then I was like okay oh I have an
RSS feed he's like okay let's record one tonight and we recorded episode one
it's a very mysterious episode which no longer exists why what happened to it
it is a you know it is a hidden history of our podcast it was like I brought a
bottle of wine and I you know by the end of the show was like that was great then
I look at the bottle of wine I'm like I almost drank that entire bottle of wine
yeah then I listened to the show and I was like no yeah cuz he's hammered I got
hammered it was a big bottle too it's like yeah so it was you guys who chose
to take it yeah I was like I was like that was awesome he's like bro no we're
not publishing that yeah so our show starts at episode two it starts with
episode two yeah that's funny yeah so it you know it just and that kind of stuff
we do that kind of stuff with our show all the time we have there's our show
specifically is a conversation between us two between the brothers we do get
guests on but that's not nearly as often as it's just us talking or we're
reviewing somebody's book or whatever it's our conversation and then we bring
our listeners in on it you know we read their emails we get them involved and so
we have a lot of inside jokes and one of the inside jokes is you know episode
two is the very first episode yeah but you guys also do or have done like a
weekly podcast with Randall Carlson right yes yeah we started that like four
years ago yeah how did that come about so we had been aware of Randall for a
while and you know we mentioned him on our show multiple times and then and then
I found out that he was going to be at an event in Colorado that with grimerica
boys yeah with grimerica with our friends from grimerica and yeah so they
were hosting it and I was like and I had listened to grimerica for years you know
so I was like hey I told Kyle's like dude we should go to this we can meet the
grimerica guys we can meet Randall and so we signed up for it for it was they
were gonna be there for 10 days we were gonna be there for three it's like a
they were pulling three groups of people through so we were signed up for the
first set and we went and met Randall and we sort of became staff they asked us
to stick around so we stayed the entire 10 days help drive the vans you know
sort of help manage the event and by the end of it we were telling Randall like
dude like we'll help you start a podcast let's get it going like you have all
this research material let's do it in podcast format and start publishing it
you know and so and that's how we started Cosmographia yeah really yeah we
I once again I I helped him build the RSS feed we you know we went back and
forth on graphics website they have a you know I build on a simple website they
have a much more advanced one now but yeah at the time it was just like let's
just start doing it you know like let's just get it out there you know you
will get better as we go right right and so we started it and and it was a
weekly show we started with I guess we started talking about what's that guy's
name the Oregon energy that was the first episode we kind of did a sort of
cover all this different stuff and then we went into Atlantis and then we started
doing Younger Dryas right and then we went into I guess climate change now
we're doing what are we talking about now that we went into the sun the sun a
little bit now we're doing like mounds of America yeah that's right wow yeah so
you guys just pick different topics to talk about like every month or something
or Randall runs that because he does like I notice he does multiple episodes on
different on like the same time many many many episodes yeah yeah yeah he he
decides like the show content we're just really we're on the production side
okay but it's almost like a classroom where we're students yeah so he's
presenting all this information we can ask questions make stupid jokes yeah
we're good at making dumb jokes but yeah that's I think you know he he seems to
really thrive in that sort of like classroom setting oh yeah yeah I was
telling you guys last night I could listen to him read the phone book yeah
yeah so interesting to listen to yeah and then and then how did you how did
you guys eventually get in touch with with Ben again Ben Kirkwick that was
simple I I when he started publishing videos I I think he had only published
two or maybe three and then I went and watched them and then I was like these
are amazing I just sent him a message on Twitter I was like bro your your your
videos are sweet come on our show he's like okay you know what was his first
video about about the ancient or the high technology stuff was it about like
one of his trips to Egypt or I think it weren't they the earlier ones were about
the Peru stuff I don't know what the first one yeah oh sorry Ben I don't
remember I the first thing I remember watching specifically was the pull up a
channel we'll find out yeah yeah we'll find out the yeah he did make stuff some
stuff on Peru and he was talking about the drill course the core yeah the two
drills two drills yeah yeah maybe he also deleted his first ever no way I
know he made Sarah P and videos in the very beginning as well so but yeah so we
just messed I just messaged him on Twitter and he just agreed to come on the
show and then we've been you know we've been doing stuff together ever since like
we he's been on our show multiple times we've been on his we've done gone on
tours with them we go to Egypt we're going to Egypt with him in a couple
weeks actually we're gonna be gone for six weeks you guys were there just in
what in May of last year last year we were there in November oh you were the
oh you were there literally two months ago no no I'm sorry the year in 2020
yeah yeah yeah oh okay I'm still in last year so it was last year from last year
yeah right right yeah we went to we were in Turkey in April yeah yeah oh that's
where you guys were in Turkey that's your recent video all about gobekli tepe
yeah yeah we were actually we're actually in the process of working on an
Egypt video on the on the Serapium and then we went to Turkey and we're like
okay this is all fresh in our heads let's make one on right tepe right now so
Serapium got put on hold that video was incredible thank you that you guys did
on gobekli tepe thank you I loved that explain can you explain for people who
don't know like the origins of gobekli tepe and you know obviously there's the
theory that it was deliberately buried yeah but you guys come up with like you
guys found out you guys are very you guys dug very deep yes and you found out
it's nuanced it wasn't necessarily just buried all at once it was like over a
thousand years or more right yeah yeah and it's it's well the so the thing about
the deliberate burying is it's very mysterious sounding and that so when
when you're looking at mysterious stuff or looking for mysterious things stuff
like that can affect this the the thinking on the entire site because then
you begin to think well why would they do this like what would drive them to
build something like this and then purposefully bury the whole thing and
leave it you know so if that didn't happen then that's very important to know
and the thing is that we wondered about this for so long yeah when you hear when
you hear that they intentionally buried this massive site you're just like what
why could that be and so we're going down these roads of like what was it a
time capsule were they trying to preserve a message for the future yeah this
became like a common idea you know people because this is what you ask
yourself when it's like a monument treasure yeah yeah so why were they doing
it were they hiding it were they were they trying to preserve it for the
future all these narratives pop up because of that and I mean this goes
back to like my earliest interest in the ancient world was looking for arrow
heads here and you start to learn what campsites look like what human
occupation sites look like you know in the Neolithic times or whatever when
they were just working with rough stone tools and you can see what their
debitage looks like and that's when we first walked up to the site of gobekli
tepe it was almost instant I was just like this is midden yeah you can see it
what is what is midden midden is basically human occupation layers or
layers of sediment that are all of the bits and pieces of debris and debitage
from normal human activity now obviously there are walls and structures in there
this is a funny question because I thought we would I figured we would
talk about this and it's interesting because Kyle learned about midden and
then we would Kyle and I would go on arrowhead hunting trips and we'd be
walking and he'd be like oh this is midden and I look down I'm like what are
you looking at what is the difference right and eventually you learn to see
it and it's a lot of times it's a bunch of very similar sized rocks like that
are kind of squarish you know that it and you just sort of recognize it you're
like ah this is somebody made this pile of stones and it's just very old they
didn't like they weren't carving the rocks or anything like that is just that
when you bring a bunch of stones in and you make fires with them they sort of
break in regular patterns and you end up with kind of a gravel like a cobble
sized gravel okay they just look very regular it doesn't look natural where
everything can be just randomly different sizes right they're all sort of
very similar like fist shaped fist sized rocks and you recognize a whole
there's a pile of these you know covered in grass very old and then you start
digging in it and I mean you don't have to dig very much and you find specific
like markers like there will be a certain kind of shell at least in the
states you find this there will be a certain kind of snail shell all in the
minute it just depends on the types of of materials that they were around yeah
at the time okay like the dirt for example looks a little more sooty it has
like got ash in it it's got a lot of charcoal but you know there's all this
stuff that people collected there are you know broken tiny little broken shards
of flint just everywhere everywhere yeah well that was the material they were
working with so if you were if you were in a place where they were working with
quartz then you would be finding chunks and little tiny bits of quartz everywhere
if that's the stone they were working with obsidian or obsidian yeah so there's
another example of we were we were at a place that we had basically confirmed
was an occupation site we was just like okay yes people were living here we were
finding flint we were fine all this stuff we're walking away after about an
hour of looking around and somebody finds a little piece of obsidian time like
turn on yeah we're going back there's an obsidian arrowhead up here yeah there's
no reason for this piece of obsidian flake to be on this hill it doesn't
belong here it's not from here there's no volcanoes anywhere nearby humans
brought it here yeah they made something out of it it's volcanic yeah so it's
stuff it's little tiny things like that and sure enough we found a workpiece of
obsidian there yeah really yeah you found an obsidian arrowhead it's it's not
complete it's a little tiny bird point like a dart and where was this I'm not
gonna tell you about that it was in Arizona yeah okay it was near secret
spot in Arizona where was that we were it was near Sedona yeah Sedona yeah so
when you when you the first time you pulled up to so which part of is this
go back to the proper where that now there's a big dome over the top yes is
before the okay that that chamber right there that's the that's enclosure C yeah
the one in the front there yeah so D is the one to the left to the right to the
right yeah so you can see the obviously there are rock walls and and a lot of
the stones that you're seeing that are just kind of kind of bigger ones are
probably broken down rock walls but when you look closer at that material you
can tell that it most of its that it's midden it's basically it's like full of
little tiny flint flakes from a people who were working flint every day of their
lives making tools there are pieces of grinding stones which were they were
made of basalt now there's a basalt out crop within a few like a kilometer of
this site so they were going down to this basalt outcrop which is basalt is a
volcanic stone as well and it's a good grinding stone so they were making
grinding stones for grinding whatever grain ochre they ground all kinds of
stuff they ground a massive amount of stuff based on the number of grinding
stones found in this place in fact the archaeologists were blown away they
were like why like they even did this pretty cool experiment where they they
got people to grind on one of these they made their own grinding stones just like
the ones that could back the tepe and they grind for eight hours in a day to
see how much material that they came up with and it was enough to feed like five
people really one guy and so one guy for eight hours yeah so based on the amount
of one college kids one college kid who's never done it before a grinding for
eight hours can feed five people so they were just blown away they're like
there are way too many grinding stones here to support whatever population may
have been nearby so what the hell were they doing they were manufacturing a
lot of stuff whoever these people were that had the grinding stones now I'm
not necessarily saying that's connected to who built this place but there are
broken grinding stones all over it and broken arrowheads broken flint shards so
people were living and working there all the way up to fairly modern times I
mean to the at least medieval times and I mean it's being farmed right now so
technically they're still there people never let yeah see the trees on the upper
top there that's an orchard those are all of trees yeah so what the radio
carbon dating here bring says it's at least the the farthest back it goes is
how old again it's like oh man god look at the landscape there the view there is
just unbelievable I'm just gonna say roughly 12,000 years old yeah roughly
12,000 yeah now they had a lot of difficulty in the dating they they
already had for I don't know how many decades and established oh wow what a
great view a well established dating of artifacts by style okay yeah in the whole
Anatolian area they have been they have been digging in midden piles human
occupation layers looking at styles of flint points arrowheads tools and had
all this and then had very good carbon dates from those layers in multiple
different sites corroborating the evidence of each one so that they had a
well established time period for the types of arrowheads you would find so if
you pick up this type of arrowhead they could instantly say well that's you know
8,000 years old because of the style okay at the very bottom layers of gobeckli
tepe they were finding the arrowheads of a people that were 12,000 years old and
how do they know those people were 12,000 years old because of the dates from
other because they had dug so many other sites all around Anatolia yeah that had
those arrowheads in layers that had carbon dateable materials that showed
that date okay so like what's up guys I'm super psyched to introduce to you
another product that I've been using for years now that was also recommended to
me by the world renowned nutritional scientist dr. Dominic Dagestino and it

link below and use the promo code Danny20 at checkout back to the show many many
times over at many different sites when they found those arrowheads and they
carbon dated something from the same layer they would get the same date so
it's pretty good corroborating evidence that those arrowheads are consistent
with a date of roughly 12,000 years so when they get to the bottom the
archaeologists looking at the bottom layers it would go back to tepid like
this 12,000 years old the burial layers not the stonework but the layers at the
very bottom that start to build up of dirt right that are burying the site now
in some cases so that means the stonework is older or it has to be at
least at least as old yeah it can't be yeah it can't really be younger unless
there's something another drastic that like they dug through all that stuff and
and the idea is that the people that we're using making and using these
arrowheads were just like very primitive hunter-gatherers that would not be
capable up until this point that's who they were you see what I'm saying up
until the point of the discovery of gobekli tepe those hunter-gatherers were
considered primitive hunter-gatherers who never really built anything right
astonishing yeah and they definitely not monumental they didn't have pottery the
name of this culture is called the ppna pre pottery neolithic a because there's
a ppnb re pottery neolithic a yeah so they didn't have pottery yet they were
making gigantic standing stone circles by flattening bedrock I mean they took a
slope of bedrock and flattened it yeah see that made it level if you look at in
enclosure see there you see that the little pedestal that the central stone
is on yes yes yeah see how it's on a pedestal and then around it is flat that
is smooth flattened limestone bedrock it is a pedestal itself is still the
bedrock so they were they basically removed cut out all the negative stone
bedrock around that pedestal yeah and then they they cut a slot into the
pedestal and set and then slotted that standing stone into it what yeah so it's
not a simple construction and it you know the the the floors of the enclosures
are smooth and beautiful and even I don't know if this I can't remember this
one but on in some cases the sides of the pedestal are decorated in and relief
carvings so you like there's like a roof it's it's not high it's like mid okay
mid-relief but it's but they are sticking out yeah it's not like it's not
like they're cutting the thing into the stone they're cutting the stone away and
leaving their carving right there is a high relief when it's almost as it's a
sculpture of a cat it's behind that pillar yeah it's it's directly behind it
there you can't see it in this photo yeah but it's it's amazing work how much
deeper do you think it goes how much that's the bedrock so I that's the
bottom yeah oh that's the bottom yeah in some places we there's a lot of tunnels
in the bedrock not at gobekli tepe but in this area of turkey they were tunneling
into bedrock notice this in the picture here this is another thing to point out
they had these portal stones where they had cut this so you imagine you cut a
big square slab and then you completely cut the middle of it out to make a you
know a portal stone we did that was broken one of the middle yeah we didn't
get to go to the museums but I've seen some photographs of portal stones like
this that have high relief carvings of like cats standing on the edge of that
portal reaching over as though they might be drinking out of a pool in the
center of the portal beautiful yeah works you know yeah so when we went to the
the earthquake and flood had just happened in turkey so we can oh yeah so
all the museum about that yeah so the museums were closed and they had moved
you know 40,000 crates of artifacts out of the museum dude a ton of people died
in that yes in that earthquake a lot of people yeah yeah see the high relief cat
there oh my god that's nuts yeah yeah so I think we're you know we're most
interested in the building techniques you know there's like that yeah that is
that's awesome so think about this like to make this pillar the person at the
quarry had to leave a sizable chunk of stone sticking out of the side of that
pillar so the artist had material to work with right so it's this this is
thoughtful this is planning the guy at the quarry may not be the guy who carved
this cat or whatever this thing is I doubt that it's the same person so you
have to have engineering and planning and there's actually some new data coming
out by some scientists that looking at the entire layout of the stone circles
that suggests the entire site was planned the original narrative was that
the original idea was that one circle was built and used for a while and then
they sort of like you know they put this all this stuff into sort of a
religious context like well it has to be a religion why why else would you build
it's ritual it's religion it's yeah no one builds no atheists ever build stone
circles apparently no atheists ever builds beautiful temple buildings or stone
circles or mountain monuments could be true I don't know they don't but you
know it's it's like they do all these rituals and then it's like okay the
rituals are done the gods are appeased bury that circle dig another one build
another circle this was the early on ideas but now it looks like the entire
site was planned and it's interesting because when you when you start reading
the you know the the papers they with the artifacts and the carvings they have
totems they yeah the totems are strange sick yeah with the artifacts and the
carvings it looks like each enclosure may have had a specific animal type
associated with it so you have like the circle you know the the the enclosure of
the cat the enclosure of the boar the enclosure of the bird the enclosure of
the serpent the enclosure of the fox right and so it's like you start to
think of like is this a kind of magic school yeah it's like your guys wildest
theory on what the fuck it was I think it might actually be I think the
Gryffindors are gonna beat the Gryffindors which is too bad because
clearly we're part of Slytherin right brothers of the serpent but yeah it's
it's I mean I I really like the idea that the standing that the standing
stones themselves at least the central pillars and the flattened platforms may
be very very old far older than even the artifacts and found in there because
that's the thing when you dig into the archaeological papers on this they do
say specifically they say the dates that we get from the lithics which is would
be the arrowheads the ppna stuff from the pottery and also from dating organic
material in the mortar of the rough stone walls at the very bottom give us
these early dates of you know 12,000 before present cannot date the megalithic
architecture it just doesn't give you the dates for that stuff because it could
have been there before that the big tea pillars yes yeah and the shaping of the
bedrock right so is it possible that you know that somebody built this stuff a
long time ago and then they just disappeared or went somewhere else or
whatever and then later people's family found and started rebuilding it and
this is somewhat some of the outer smaller pillars are their attempts to
recreate so they're in other words they're learning you know some of these
techniques yeah and then they live here they build the rough stone walls then
maybe they cover them over who knows you know so we kind of came up with this
idea that I love this idea the idea of ancient archaeologists yeah there is
evidence that people think about what archaeologists do I mean the people that
that have come here and dug out this site they have excavated the site they've
stood up pillars they tried to rebuild some rock walls so when I look at this
site at from a construction standpoint these rock walls between the pillars
those don't look like they belong the building style doesn't match right the
rock walls are not shaped stones they're just sort of whatever size and shape
that they are they're they use mortar they don't have carving on them they
used plaster supposedly and in a lot of cases the rock walls cover up the
carvings on the pillars so it looks to me like someone came in and tried to
restore an already ancient and dilapidated site and so they would be
doing what modern archaeologists do they come in they find this just just pile
of rubble and then they start lining up the blocks and numbering them reorganizing
them try to rebuild the entire temple or whatever it is and and why wouldn't why
do we do this in the first place because we're interested in our past it
wouldn't surprise me in the least if some people 12,000 years ago found this site
and we're like we've got to see what this was all about 12,000 years ago that
was right in the middle of the Younger Dryas right right at the right after
the end of it just after 12,000 was the very end of it yeah and it lasted for
like a 1000 years right like 10,600 or something yeah 11,006 would be the
end of the Younger Dryas something like that and yeah you're right so yeah
then you're looking at people this would be just after right the end of it I'm
pretty sure 10,000 something BC so this was built after yeah well that no the
the dates for the lithics in the bottoms of the walls like we don't know when
that's what we're trying that's what I'm trying to say like it much he may be
much older than that so these ancient archaeologists could have been after the
Younger Dryas right trying to figure out what this was and trying to preserve it
and could be looking to our past there is evidence that later peoples came and
dug down into the midden specifically into the if you look at enclosure C
again mm-hmm that one see how the top of that pillar is broken yeah and that's
and then pillar down on the lower right the big one down there is also busted
mm-hmm there's two huge pillars there and they're broken you can see all the
shattered pieces lying around in the bottom of the enclosure there somebody
specifically around was it 6,000 BC I think something like that 6,000 BC so you
know four to 6,000 years after the site was no longer in use somebody came along
and specifically dug a hole down to the tops of those pillars and smashed them
and then reburied the site at least that's what it indicates we don't know
if they really smashed them but right you know it could be that someone smashed
them yeah what was the term they use iconoclast iconoclastic yeah so I
wonder I mean thinking about the earthquake that just happened I wonder
how many of those earthquakes has this had to survive right that would be one
reason to bury it on purpose if you didn't want it to you know if you're
like I'm not gonna be here to take care of it anymore but you bury it so the
earthquakes won't destroy it yeah protect it huh yeah but really the
burial looks more like collapses of the midden in something maybe like the heavy
rainfall that they got yeah because you can see at the site you can see that
they have used sandbags and all this stuff to shore up the walls around the
excavation excavation site the modern excavation of this okay they're trying
to prevent all of this midden and soil and rocks and rubble from falling back
into these enclosures right so if these enclosures were already like at the
time maybe covered in midden and people dug out dug them out then the midden
would collapse back into it and of course be jumbled up that's the other
problem with the dating of the site is that the midden from within these
enclosures is in some cases inverted the older stuff is at the top the younger
stuff is at the bottom oh like it and this is why they thought it was buried
it's like they're just throwing material in yeah but it could also be from
natural collapses of material that have fallen back into the yeah they described
the material that was in there as in a series of lenses which is you know
that's what if the soil falls in and makes this sort of lens shape in the
hole and then another set falls in from this side and makes another one of the
new so when they dig through it's they can see it's it doesn't have a
stratigraphy really like naturally laid sediment but you can see that it's
several different collapses so it's so has this all been accepted in like the
mainstream now like now that this has been discovered and tested and looked at
and analyzed for so long is it is this now have they officially rewritten the
human timeline the or is it still the human timeline is it still just youtube
speculation no no like when we were doing all the you know the reading and the
research for making the gobekli tepe video specifically we were reading the
scientific papers written by the people who had been working on the site right
so this all this stuff we're telling you is stuff that came from them not not so
much they probably wouldn't specifically say that the that the stone pillars
could be far far older but they have specifically said that they cannot date
them yeah and all that they have been able to determine is like you know the
latest possible date for those things like though they must have been built at
that time or before 10 000 bc ish so the pillars yes yeah because the you know
the material in the bottom is basically that yeah the other thing that it did
really to the human timeline it would what i feel like it should have done
was was made people accept that humans were doing megalithic stonework like or
that that a that civilization may have started quite a bit earlier than what
was previously believed but instead what they did was they modified what they
believed that hunter-gatherers do right in their spare time yeah which is in my
opinion ridiculous it's like well we don't want to see the point that that you
know everything that we've said about humans advancement through time is
incorrect we'll just modify this that's a definition of this term photo see the
see the anthropomorphizing of the of the pillars this is the other weird thing
and this is you'll love this like we aren't we didn't come up with this
connection but many people have pointed it out see how each pillar there the two
central ones they've got that v the v shape going down that's a sideways v
it's a sideways v yeah it's an arm so there you can view the pillars as
basically standing human figures they have arms that go down the side and then
wrap around in the front see if you can find a picture that shows the front of
them with the fingers yeah they're standing there kind of holding their
belts yeah they have belts on so you can view the t shape at the top is sort of
the head um and there's arms carved into them yeah they're standing with their
fingers wrapped around the front of their belts yeah it's it's it's a very
strange and kind of eerie representation they're wearing yeah there there you go
see his fingers are there yeah yeah down right there yes this one this one
yeah oh see if you can open that up right so he's
there we go yeah i wish i thought so this is like his hands down to his side
yeah so see the belt going around down there and it's got a fox pelt hanging
from the belt on the front and those are his fingers coming around the front
there just above the belt he's kind of holding his belly real thin they're
incredibly thin and you can see the two lines going up the center he's wearing
like a jacket yeah he's got a robe or a jacket on it's got a belt with
complicated buckles or something around it and a fox pelt or something hanging
from the front right this is a very interesting uh carving so they are
supposed to be anthropomorphic figures and so aliens right it's well yeah or
some kind of strange hominid gong right now you want to start thinking about
longheads or onanaki or something right there's two of them in the in each
enclosure and they're you know it's like uh like twins or brothers or two
different guys standing there in the middle taller than everything else
sort of surrounded by a council or knowledge in the shape of other tea
pillars facing them but the so the other weird thing and
this is wild see if you can um oh he's up yeah if when you get back there pull
up uh some pictures of the moai statues on east
or island uh yo east or island just got like burned down right
didn't and a bunch of those heads got like torch oh no yeah how do you burn
stone heads it's not they're not stone they're they're what are they steve
volcanic um ash yeah they're made of ash they look like
concrete but they're like tough is it volcanic tough
i don't know but it's you can find out you can burn it i thought they were
basalt so you can see some of these yeah just pull
up one of the pictures of whether there's a bunch of them in a row
yeah it's it may be tough to see on this
oh gosh i'm just gonna make me zoom in oh yeah
the ad zoom bigger than the regular picture can you find out what exactly
what it's called these stones are made out of steve
well if it's it's ash it might be volcanic tough which is actually a pretty
soft i don't know why they call it tough it's
yeah it's soft it's not tough at all right okay yeah so there you go it's
volcanic tough solidified ash okay so yeah that stuff
that's what the um the tunnel systems why can't i think of
darin q you yeah darin q you in turkey they're dug out of volcanic tough
oh really yeah it's actually not that underground labyrinth yes
it's not that difficult to to dig whoa look at the shit on his back yeah this
is one that was buried for a long time and he has all kinds of stuff on his
back yeah all kinds of stuff there there are a lot of
stylistic similarities to some of the things that are carved onto these moai
statues is what we see gobeckli tepe how have you never showed me this
uh this is the person keeping this from you know i gotta hold back those snake
facts bro sometimes did you guys go to darin kuyu
not yet no can you go in there yeah really yeah what do you think darin
kuyu was for what was that bill for i mean the first thing it makes me think
of is like a oh go to that one with the people
standing next yeah there you go yeah see if you can get in on the
it may be one of the many arcs oh look at that there are those fingers dude look
at that oh yeah the fingers you're in yeah
oh my gosh dude yeah see the fingers that is wild it's so weird how it's
similar there are other statues in other places that
have this same pose now you could argue like this
isn't that big of a deal the pose or whatever but i do find the
long thin strange looking fingers to be sort of
it's just weird that they would come up with that two different things it's so
different places and different times you know that's the question how old are
these things you know are some of them very old
they have no way to carbon date the the tough stuff right
yeah and look how deep it is in the sediment so deep
yeah now you could carve you could carbon date that sediment possibly
right like if you get to the bottom and you find a piece of organic material
like a burnt like say maybe somebody had a campfire
nearby right uphill slightly and so then when the
when this sort of inundation of soil came in maybe it pushed some of that
that charcoal around in the same layers at the base
of this of this statue you could date those
and then you could maybe make a correlation that the statue was stood up
in this place at least by this date
hmm right but that date could be very young
because when the statue was not buried the statue was already very old
you see what i mean the date of the of the charcoal of somebody's fire pit
near the statue doesn't mean the statue dates to the age of the fire pit the
statue could be much older right just can't that's just the minimum date
yeah the other interesting thing with this i remember when i was first
you know like soon after the accident when i'm looking at easter island you
know long years and years ago you can find uh or at least at the time i did i
found old drawings where you know what is that
airplane on the bottom right of the picture sorry go ahead no that's an h
sorry i'm gonna bring that up it's like an airplane
yeah there's somebody's watermark i don't know what that is yeah uh
there are sketches where some of the first people to visit the island
sat and you know and sketched the heads and the sort of the landscape and
they're you know very well done and you can find a
photograph of that same spot so 400 years later
400 or 500 years later of the same spot and it hasn't changed at all
the heads are all in the same you know how some of them are tilted this way is
tilted that way right they're buried to the same spot you
know like up to the chin or just up to the shoulders
as this sketch from 400 years ago and then you look at the timeline where
they're supposed to have all been built between
i can't remember exactly was it 1400 to 1500 ad
something like that that was when they were all erected
so the people who did the sketch came there around 100 years after that
and the statues are already buried up to their necks
and then in the next 400 years nothing changes and so it's sort of difficult to
believe but the other interesting thing is
so wait 1400 ad they were they were stood up again
no i think that the the idea is that they that the first european explorers
that showed up on the island showed up about a hundred years after the
statues had been put up according to the standard
story standard story standard story got it okay
yeah and don't you know like i may be getting some of this a little inaccurate
i can't remember all the dates exactly but it's basically around a hundred years
after the statues have been completed or nobody
was making them anymore is when the first european showed up and then they made
sketches and then you can compare those sketches
you know to yeah look at the look at how similar this looks very similar to the
pillar carving is it really birds the vultures the
yeah it's it's really strange stuff keeps going down a little bit but you
know see this is what people do when you find volcanic tough you just
you just do this thing oh look at the whole
video what's carved on their backs yeah that is beautiful
now the wow somebody somebody superimposed paint on onto a no they
actually painted it oh they yeah they paint a real one yeah
wow that's amazing that's so weird check out that
bird thing yeah like a vulture yeah yeah it looks very ceremonious ritualistic
yeah
so the other it's like if you're that advanced why are you wasting your time
carving stones i also love that they have these red
hats you know what are those things that's a fez
it's a fez so interesting don't do it without your
fez you think this was just super easy for them to do
it does seem like creating this stuff is like it's like nothing to them or do
you think they actually spent fucking months and months and years
creating this stuff out of this stone well either way you want to know what
is the reason like what was the drive to do it right you know like if it was
easy or even if it was difficult like what why did they
want to do this stuff you know and i just a lot of times you find the
the standard story to be sort of it's just not very satisfactory
um anyway the the thing i was pointing out is that a lot of that that's the
caldera the the extinct volcano oh that's the volcano on easter island yeah
okay there's also um gorgeous a form of writing called rongo rongo
yeah it comes from this place uh that's never been deciphered well they
haven't found very much of it yeah some wood carvings of the
writing style but it looks it's very interesting looking
and there you go yeah and it's extremely similar
lots of very similar characters too wow can you zoom in on that a little bit
isn't that awesome looking that is incredible it looks almost perfect
yeah that may be a recreation i've seen it on a wood
there on wood yeah like a but yeah that's that's awesome it's like figures
and stuff there's somewhat stylized uh hieroglyphs like think of semaphore
you know uh semaphore is like the the a language of body
you know like people that people that see would use this or with you know
it looks like semaphore like it's like little stylized drawings of human
figures doing different positions um
which is why we came up with this idea that it was a there's the wood
yeah there's the wood no that that's the same thing it's that papyrus
okay okay but there's so what's interesting is how similar it looks to
the um the indus valley script uh which is you know that's in
pakistan and it has there's an undeciphered script there
that looks almost exactly like this stuff from eastern island
again on the you know on the wrong side of the world
so is there a connection now you're thinking you know okay so you got indus
valley you got gobekli tepe so far and both of these are pointing to
in stylized ways and even with the writing to
eastern island there's a lot of very of the very same kind of figures some of
them are different but it's very similar
hmm yeah i mean it's one of the most like perplexing things to me
is how like based on how advanced these people were how long it took them to
do this kind of stuff like did it really take them that long or was it just
super fucking easy yeah for them to do
there's some stuff that looks like it was easy to do
just based on how i just i don't know it's like some of the granite stonework
that you see in in egypt where they they're like removing
material after they've put the stone in place because
that they're faith they're essentially facing off a wall to make it flat
the amount of material they're removing from some of these stones is just
insane like you can't imagine uh i could pull some up here for this uh
yeah like i mean just like that's that's what i'm sorry i interrupt you no no i
was just gonna say like the serapium boxes by themselves are just so
fascinating because as you know chris talks about in his book chris
dunn talks about in his books he asked one of the biggest granite
manufacturers in the country why how what it would take for them to
reproduce that box and he said we couldn't reproduce that the way it is
we would have to take separate slabs and bolt them together
and it would cost upwards of a half a million dollars
yeah yeah we can look at some of those too the boxes in the serapium but this
is uh this is minkara the third pyramid on geese of the small one that people
mostly don't pay attention to but it has this very interesting stonework at the
base of it like minkara just like the other pyramids
there are built out of the core material all this stuff up here
is limestone right this is all limestone blocks but down here
i can move in so this is the smallest one in the line of three
yes okay yeah look at those granite blocks like i you know some people in
here for scale these are huge and there these would be the
casing stones or the facing stones right so the other two pyramids were also
cased right in this beautiful tura limestone it's a very hard white limestone
and they were flattened all the way up and you know there's old
writings about how they would pardon this brief interruption but i want to take a
second to talk about our sponsor verso now if you've heard this podcast before
chances are you already know how obsessed i am with health and longevity
which is why one of my favorite guests to have on the show is nutritional
scientist and neuroscientist dr dom dagestino who
actually introduced me to this stuff verso is a company that is dedicated to
translating scientific breakthroughs into products that hold a
potential to increase longevity the problem with aging is we accumulate
these zombie cells or old damage cells that linger beyond their useful
life these zombie cells infect other healthy cells
speeding up the aging process causing things like hair loss wrinkles
arthritis cancer dementia and everything in the realm of aging
what scientists have realized is that we can manually induce
autophagy meaning the cleanup process of the old zombie cells and replacing them
with new ones verso's new clean being which i take every
night is a powerful blend of synelitic molecules that help
promote the body's natural cleanup processes like autophagy and apoptosis
promoting better cellular health supporting lower inflammation and
natural cardioprotective functions while boosting protection against age
related diseases the three main ingredients in clean
being are spermedine lutolyn and dehydrochorsatin
which play key roles in the control of gene expression and are essential for
cell growth and proliferation specifically when it comes to
cardiovascular and cognitive function skin health

danie it's spelled d a n n y to save 15 off your entire order or just go to
ver.so forward slash Danny back to the show
shine like mirrors in the desert before the casing stones were gone because
they were so and they were stripped off and looted
yeah there was earthquakes and then they're gone yeah the way to look at
this is like the this is the roof of the structure yeah that casing
right so you build the interior of the structure that with you can build it
with much softer stone in some cases they built them with mud brick
um but you then case that in a very hard stone
turra limestone is a very hard silica rich form of limestone
so it's much harder the roads way slower granted obviously is
is even harder than that it takes forever to erode
but that's like you're putting a roof on the structure to protect the structure
and then when it's gone you can see that the the core masonry there is just
heavily it's getting degraded degraded now do we know if the interior of these
smaller pyramids is anything similar to the great pyramid
they have passageways and chambers um i actually we haven't been in mincari
yet we're going to do that this year but do we have diagrams like we have
diagrams of all the single yeah all the chambers so we have we know what the
insides of these are mapped out for the most part if i recall correctly the
great pyramid is the only one that has any substantial structures in the body
of the pyramid itself the rest of them mostly go underground
so the whole it seems like the entire the bent pyramid has some pretty substantial
yes you're right the bent pyramid has structures inside of it i'm scanned that
yeah but most of the time it's just see the see the
entrance back here this is the entrance right here
okay so this is just a descending passageway it basically goes straight
down into the ground and then there's chambers way down in there
the great pyramid does this as well but there's a descending passage that goes
up as well and then you have the grand gallery and the you know the queen's
chamber and the king's chamber up inside the body of the pyramid
but when you go into kafre the middle pyramid
it just has a descending passageway and usually down underneath it
but there's nothing in this in the not that is no yeah but anyway look at so
you're noticing these blocks and we're you know we're talking about this because
of like was it easy right these these are this is not in substantial amounts of
stone as you can see from the people standing here these are huge blocks
they have to be tilted and they're also notice how they're kind of puffy or
like pillowy yeah so they were leaving extra material on because they were
going to flatten it like this let's see i move forward oh some of them are
flattened yeah just right around the entrance and also notice all these
nubs yeah those are the same nubs on the ones in
south america in central america yeah they had these all over the world
it's there's a lot of interesting ideas about these i kind of lean
kyle and i kind of lean towards the idea that they're functional like they were
used for maneuvering and then they were cut off
during the during the finishing process but here you here you can see the
part of the flattened face
uh oops i'm using back out and move here uh yeah and then there's some
like reverse nubs you know insets and then you know for grabbing this block
but look at all this extra material like look at this huge
you know and grand it's heavy so you're talking about a lot of extra material
on here i could come back to some of the but here's the flattened face so how
come the rest of us not flattened like this well that's the question
that is a great question it's like why didn't they finish the job
you know but this is there's this big square of flattened area right here
in front of the entrance uh which seems funny you know if it's if
this is a tomb and you're trying to sort of hide the entrance and everything
like that well this makes it relatively obvious where the door is
right yes and also because the other two large pyramids had
casing stones all over them and those were completely flattened they were
perfect yeah they were finished this just looks like it was not completed
like they were in the process or they were using that they were using this
surface as a survey point this is the other thing we've discussed yeah
we actually have some evidence after walking all the way around this pyramid
looking so you can imagine that one of these blocks this flattened blocks
because it has a top and bottom and then it has this beveled
this this angled face and there's going to be a certain
cut degree angle yeah flat surface here and a flat surface there right that the
other blocks will not have because they're all puffy and pillowy on the front
so when we were walking around the pyramid there's just piles and piles of
granite laying on the sides of the pyramid to cord out
so we were looking for blocks with this angle two flat surfaces like a prison
stone yeah and we found them yep on the around the
around the other two sides that are not uh uncovered
so i think that there was a flattened we think that there's
pretty good case to be made that there was a flattened surface about this size
on each side of the pyramid there is one on the other side which we'll look at
in a minute like on the this is the this is the north side so around on the
uh east side of the pyramid there is another flattened face
that and the other interesting thing just to point out is the only reason we
have this pile of casing stones here is because
as people were quarrying the stuff above it the granite off here they were
making piles of rubble down here and it basically just covered this
stuff up and it became too difficult to dig out so they just left so it still
survives because it got buried under the other quarrying
intentionally buried there you go intentionally buried right
so but the other point they think so if they were going to smooth the stones
they would start from the top maybe you would want to yeah
you'd think that you'd want to start from the from the top stones right but you
have to build it from the bottom so this is the thing how do you
how do you maintain as you're going up the the integrity of this flat surface
as you're stacking these blocks up where in other words where you where as
you're setting each stone in you know it has enough material on it
that when you flatten it out there isn't going to be a hole somewhere right
so maybe you flatten out a uh a square area at the first few courses at the
base to give yourself a survey platform so that you can check as you go up
using it you know whatever method you got a really simple method
to check the distance from the bottom of this to the top of it and then
extend that further out as you make new courses like do we have enough stone
sticking out where they actually meet each other in this
crevice is that far enough out so right here flatten it it won't be a voice no
voice see this deep this deep crevice between the stones here and here you
want to make sure that when you flatten it to here there's not actually going
to be like a hole in here somewhere right that makes sense yeah yeah so you
can do it by you know you can just put a couple of uh like rods in here with
string and pull and you end up pulling the string all the way up and you're
just checking distances as you go up do we have enough stone in each place and
you can move it this way and that way you can sweep it back and forth
and check the whole face and so that was the ideas like did they have
four of these on each face and you have one facing crew per side of the
pyramid and they just didn't have time to finish the job
which is another interesting yeah so it seems like they built the great pyramid
first and then this was the last one or maybe the uh maybe kafre the central
pyramid was the one built first ben actually thinks that's the first one oh
really yeah and i it's it's interesting because that one the other great thing
about that one is it has a couple of rows at the very bottom of granite casing
stones that have been finished and they are i mean they're just unbelievably
magnificent you know just perfectly cut beautiful granite casing stones and then
as you walk around that pyramid it's your there's a row of granite rubble
all the way around the thing because people were cutting them up to take
these beautiful faces that have been cut because the source of this granite is
500 miles away so if you're somebody living near this area
that's so wild yeah but you need to fucking get a plane to go you need to
fly there when you're traveling yeah that's not why this it's not wild
this is just what people do it's the easiest way to yeah totally natural like
listen when you want to build a cool structure in the desert you
bring stone from 500 miles away and you stack it up into a triangle it's like
the simplest thing to do like everybody does it
it's crazy really puts it into perspective when you're there and you
realize like like you guys were telling me last night
yeah we had to catch a plane to the quarry yeah that's how fucking far it is
well we catch a plane and then we have to ride a boat for four days
to get to the quarry yeah what do you want to see I just want to go back to
the original point of bringing this up that the perspective with
to show you how much stone was removed here so I was just I was wanting to show
this one photo because it really gives you an
idea of why why it looks to me why it was easy for them
because you wonder yourself how much work would it take to
take away that much stone to make that flat surface
now the next photo should show give you an idea of how much that is
look how much material that is it's a lot it's more it's wider than this guy's
shoulders I mean in some cases it's up to like two feet
yeah 18 inches at least they were removing of
of that granite now they they weren't oh this is granite this is granite they
weren't just cutting it with a saw
it's like I mean how do you get a saw in there yeah go back to this look notice
that there's a radius they're grinding it away somehow
you see how they're it curves up mm-hmm you know uh
it's it's like there's a like you can imagine like just putting a giant belt
sander down on this thing right you know and then they're
removing this much material that's also that's hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of pounds of stone this is granite that's a lot you know
think of a I mean trying to waste yeah like think of the
amount of waste that would create on the ground oh yeah I mean it's just
going to be piles of it especially if you're doing an entire pyramid like
this so is there is is there a uh
evidence of like layers that they had to take it away in layers or is it just
one go we don't know yeah we don't know there is no
evidence for this that the problem is uh because
there has been occupation and people working on this site for thousands and
thousands of years after this pyramid was supposedly built
I mean you just it's so hard to figure out who did what
this is the other thing you know just to put this in perspective this is like
fourth uh this is like fourth dynasty old kingdom like all these big
pyramids are in that area right so they're they're it's like the beginning
of the dynastic period of Egypt so in the oldest part of their civilization
you know new kingdom would have looked at these people and thought of them as
ancients the people who built this stuff
so this is you know so you're talking about they start out with these
monuments practically um the other thing to point out here this is
really cool because you know now we've looked at all this you see how big the
blocks are how much stone they're removing and then you see something like
this we zoom in on that where they've just oh
my god you know holy so you're setting these giant
blocks in and you're also like yeah just make that next one you know a quarter
inch down from the one next to it because it's easy
like you were saying that's the point yeah it's like this makes it look easy
oh my god at least whatever method that they it seems like the method they use
to do this just doing stuff like this was easy
i can't help but think i mean people always want to know
you know was this a geopolymer was this whatever whether there's some way
i just to me it looks like grinding like that
if they were if they had something connected to that stone that they were
laying down the one that they're putting on there that they could vibrate
that stone it would eat away both faces all
three faces that the stone is going up against
including its own and basically make the mating faces perfectly match each
other yeah so let me let me back up here and
that's what i want we can talk about that a little bit because there's
evidence here and then there's something in peru we can look at
about that as well so let me go to this slide this one here
so see the blocks at the top here this is what we're looking at
these would have been sitting up against each other
when the you know before the destruction and all the quarrying happened
this face of this block sat against that one probably this face sat up against
here i can i can probably zoom in a bit
now what's interesting it's hard to tell with this picture but these faces
aren't flat they have these curved they have these
very slight curves like the side of that block does something like this
mm-hmm and then the block that it matches has the matching
slight curves yeah it's hard so let me let me let me
so let me switch over to uh that's the point if you take two stones they can
have whatever face and you start grinding them together
eventually their faces are going to match yeah they won't be flat they'll be
curved but the contours of that curve will match
each other that's why i'm like to me i'm not saying that they
ground the stones together but that's what it would look like
yeah so these were sent to us how the fuck did they do that i have no idea
these were sent to us by one of the people that listened to our show he's
been to peru and he took these pictures specifically
so you can see it's tough to tell but you're basically there's a big block
here and a big block here and you can see that the
inside face of this block the the corner goes out on the top here
and goes in on the bottom and there's a matching face
a complex curve of the block it's almost like that it's twisted has a twist in it
on both sides that match here's a here's another picture of the same area you
can see that this interior face of this block has a twist
and it matches the twist of this block and the one it's sitting into
at the bottom
i don't know how to explain that it's the only thing that i can think of is
that they're being ground together i don't know any other way to
make that happen unless you had a computer controlling the device that
was cutting the stones and making each one exact
but if you had a computer that was cutting them exact
why would you leave the bulk of material on the front to be flattened later
why not just cut it exact if you know what i'm saying if you were so good at
laying these stones that you weren't worried about it
right that's the other thing that's interesting about leaving all the
extra material in the front is it's a you can also look at it as a
protective layer yeah you you know that your final finished
product is going to have this glossy glassy polished surface that's
completely flat mm-hmm you want that protected by multiple layers of
stone during the construction process not multiple inches of stone
so you drop a block against it it it hits it right yeah if a block was
dropped near the top of the pyramid and it had tumbled down right it's going to
do a lot of damage yeah yeah so the very last thing you'd
want to do is basically just cut down the edge right so just like painting the
inside you start at the top and you paint your way down
exactly and that's the last thing you do right so it's the finishing work and a
lot a lot of times these places look like it's the finishing work that didn't
get completed and that's why you see things like nubs
because the nubs would be gone once it's finished right
whoa man yeah now when you guys are walking around those pyramids is it
just like though like those some of the pictures of the
ben shows of those massive circular saw cuts in these
things are those just laying there for everyone to see like in the open
yes they're all over the place yeah and you can tell there's
there's multiple different types of saws and you can kind of tell the
differences between them like you can see the leading
cutting edge and if that like let's say there's a stone that's broken in half
but it has a saw mark on one side if the if the leading edge
is concave in other words going in then it's got to be some kind of circular
saw or something like that or at least a curved blade
if the leading edge is convex in other words it's coming out at you then it's
a rope saw or some kind of right because that your yeah rope saw would
never have a concave edge to it so you can kind of tell plus a rope saw can
twist and make all these interesting curves as it
goes down and you can see that in many cases rope saw chainsaw we went to um
is that what they call it a chain it's like a cable cable saw yeah we went to
we visited a quarry a marble quarry in uh in vermont and they showed us some of
their quarrying techniques like the old style where they were drilling and
using and blasting do multiple drill holes next to each other and then blast
it out to get the block right and then now now they have this new thing where
they they drill one long hole and then they run a
chain through it basically or a cable pull it back around and the cable
studded with diamond diamond synthetic diamond surface and then
they just have this machine that sits at the end and spins and just runs that
cable through and just cuts this beautiful face through that uh you know
through that marble and it will leave these interesting warped
complex surfaces as the you know because the cable just kind of
does what it wants to do right uh-huh it's basically flat but
it's got this very slight just like we see on these blocks in
some cases like they cut it with some kind of cable
yeah so it's possible that they cut the blocks in the quarry with something
like that and said these two go together but you can't do it on both sides
top and bottom do it with the whole block yeah
so it has to have been something else another possibility we've talked about
and this is you know this some of this stuff gets way out there but is it
is it uh like kyle was saying that what is it like a lapping
is that what it's called when you're rubbing the i don't yeah probably i
think it's lapping it's so so one of the what you know you had christ done in
here and he talked about you know these these triple a granite surfaces that
they have where they they use this flat plate to check
other flat stuff for manufacturing and it's kept in a climate controlled
humidity controlled room you know because that way it never changes
if it gets a little warmer it'll shift its slight bit you don't want that
because these are very precise things you make those by basically rubbing
two granite surfaces together and then add a third one
and as you do that when you have three surfaces you're rubbing together
back and forth you end up with this beautifully flat surface but if it's
just two just rubbing two of them together they can
they can become very smooth but they may have some kind of
contour but they'll match because you've been rubbing against each other so is
it possible that some of these stones are basically like you
you put them in there and you get a vibration going and it just
works its way into the other stone until you've got the surfaces all
yeah matching and then you and then you've set it get it roughly square
and then when you put it in there it it matches you can make them
all the faces match and mate all the way across because like
some of the casing stones we were looking at they may be
three feet tall and like you know eight feet wide or something but they also
go back in towards the body of the pyramid like four feet or something
yeah or more right in some cases yeah or maybe they weren't
perfectly fitting together originally when they built it and after using it
them for whatever their purpose was they all vibrated and then it just
like they all sort of melded together well one of the things chris was showing
me you can see how deep they are here this is how you know this is the depth
of the casing stones one argument i would make against that
let's say that you had one inch that it would vibrate down because like if
they're not clear if they're not perfectly mated there's gaps and stuff
like that in the first course and the second course and third and fourth and
all the way to the top then they all vibrate together
and move down you're the top layer is going to have moved
many feet down once you take up for all the gaps that were in all the courses
going all the way up right plus they would have to come together
side to side so it looks like they were doing this as they individually as they
were doing as they were building it the other thing that's great about this is
that it you know you pointed out as soon as we
pulled it up about how similar is to peru stuff right the nubs and everything
also you know peru is some of those walls that are famous for being
you know the all the blocks are different shapes sizes you know you'll
have tiny ones next to enormous ones and their fitity
that because they're building a pyramid here they are doing it in
regular layers courses is what these are called
but you can tell that each individual block is very different from the ones
it's next to like these are these two are narrow this one's got a
serious angle to it this one matches the angle but then
straightens it out here this one's kind of square some of these are really long
like you know they're in other words every block is completely different from
every other block right so it has the same sort of like
non-homogeneous style as peru except that because it's done in
in courses like this you know they have regular layers
and then let's so let's go around to the side we can see this other flattened
surface here this is around the east side of the pyramid there's another
face there oh wow and the angle yeah it got
this beautiful sort of reverse keystone in there
what is that it's really strange is that the only one you saw like that
yeah trapezoid yeah if it was if it was flip if it was flipped over
it would be a like a keystone for an arch but it's you know it's like upside
down for some reason but yeah it's it so there's this
flat surface and they've and the archaeologists have come in and cleared
this area out because there's a there's a sort of
exterior temple in this area so they dug all this stuff out removed all the
rubble it's possible that thing is a door it could be a door
people yeah is it an entrance right
doors back then were really hardcore doors were fucking crazy back in the day
yeah this it is a really strange that is wild so we
we kind of showed you this the the pyramid itself has this angle
51 degrees yep yeah and then uh so they built it out of the limestone
courses then you start stacking the granite facing stones on it and
they're sort of puffy or whatever right and you set up survey equipment and
you figure out where your finished flat face will be
this line here and then you flattened those
you know first two or three courses there like this
then you can use that flat surface to continue facing the pyramid all the way
up knowing you don't have any missing you won't have any holes in your stone
oh okay yeah so that's the idea the diagrams can help sort of yeah
yeah that makes a lot of sense and then when you're done if you have time
which these people didn't you flatten the whole thing and then you have this
beautiful flat granite face
what is your guys wildest fucking out there theory of what the pyramids were
i think part of our thing is like we have no idea yeah i just i mean we've
gone through sometimes i think that's the wildest
thing that we say because people are like what do you think it is and we're
like we don't know and the people are like what
you don't have any idea it's just like what's your favorite theory
here's what i will say about it it's hard to believe
that a society would would support a system that required that immense
amount of labor and planning and engineering all
that for no other reason than to bury like one tyrant 100%
yeah so i we the question i ask is what
what did it provide the civilization or the society of people that agreed to
do this now people make the argument ah that was slave
that you know they just had slaves and they just made them do whatever they
wanted um it's hard to imagine that that
that you could make that work i don't know i it's
you know i just think that it had to benefit the society in some way so i do
like chris dunn's idea and idea is cool because it's like it benefits
everything it benefits everyone everyone agrees like yes we should take on
this monumental task right because that it's
going to benefit society so it wouldn't surprise me if we found out
in some way that it did have a function uh and i think i think it's really
hard to ignore the reverse engineering that chris has done on it
and the ideas he's come up with and he's even remodeled these
some of like the shafts and stuff like that with the chemicals and stuff he's
he's recreated that to prove that those that those would have worked in that
way mm-hmm that's the other thing is there's
there's something that like yusuf would talk about the pyramid
uh well it's just part of the pyramid complex
and you get to see this uh if you go on these tours with band and yusuf
around these pyramids there will be other things in the area which are like
granite stones in the pavement deep under under the paving tiles because the
paving around the pyramid is actually gigantic limestone
tiles as big as this table four times as big as this table in some places
underneath one tile the size of this room it's ridiculous underneath those
are these some granite stones that have channels cut into them like a
channel like this that water would flow through or whatever and they go into or
from the pyramid and so it looks like there's this whole system of like
channels that had some liquid possibly moving through them and
bowl shaped stones cut with these tiles over top of them so something was going
on under the floor around the whole pyramid
area then there's the the basalts tiles that show up at various pyramid sites
uh so it seems like there's there's a design that has multiple things
outside the pyramid that are always around it
that also suggests some kind of function and you know people have looked at the
possibility of chemical processing metallurgy you know like it wouldn't
surprise me if it would ultimately found out someday to be something like that
yeah it's crazy to me that some some fucking billionaire hasn't just paid a
bunch of money to have it reverse engineered and recreate it to see if
they could do it i mean bro if i had a billion dollars i mean think about it
i'd be a pyramid in my yard you could you could but you could
re reverse engineer or try to recreate the pyramid into a
functioning thing at least try to do it for less than you could buy twitter for
wow it would cost less money you're right wouldn't it yeah
well i mean i don't know that's the question like um
would it actually cost less money than twitter did we don't know how expensive
you would you would need to say you need to get a team of people engineers and
and people and be like like you know price this out for me
i think chris said it would be around a billion dollars
really yeah okay i think he said that on the podcast listen billionaires um
does nasa really our area of the country is a great place to build a pyramid yeah
we have land if you would like to build a pyramid limestone there
is this granite there's red granite nearby yep in a giant batholith
yep so uh come on down to the texas hill country yeah
yeah that's what chris was saying if you wanted to rebuild the pyramid you'd
do it there's a place in texas that you would do it yeah there's a place in
texas that has more of these um where do they
call those lights that come out of the out of the ground marfa
marfa texas marfa texas that's what it was yeah he was talking about building
it near the earth energies yeah that's right yeah you could build it out in
that plane that's his newest theory the tesla connection
is he now his newest theory on it is that there was a
some sort of a jackhammer or device in the subterranean chamber
that would like pound the ground and create seismic vibrations in the
igneous rock beneath the pyramid that would create electron
electron flow oh piezoelectric flow yeah up through
the base of the pyramid because that's what it's 14 acres i think it is the
fold between 13 and 14 acres between 13 and 14 acres and and that
would capture all that electronic or the electron flow
up through the bottom chamber through the grand gallery into the main chamber
and then around the edges there's these pits where they would pour
chemicals that would somehow turn into liquid hydrogen
that would then come down the shafts and that would somehow create some sort of
chemical reaction in the queen chamber going up through the king chamber i
can't remember perfectly but and this is where you and then
microwaves are being run through the microwaves yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah
and then he's making a maser or something like that right yeah yes
exactly yeah i mean yeah that's a that's like a
power plant idea that is it's like really fascinating and it also points to
you know a an almost completely different um
like line of thought in terms of generating power than we have
in our modern times you know we have like we basically like let's heat
something up let's heat up water turn into steam
make the steam spin something and then we can run magnets on the spinning thing
and get electricity right this is a completely different mindset which is
really interesting this would have been free energy right because he he
says there was a dome that was constructed around the pier well you'd
have to build a billion dollars so it's not free
all right right right no but what i mean like what i mean by it is that the
pyramids his theory is that the pyramids would have put out this and
whatever energy they created in in his hypothesis
would have created this free energy that you could just get out of the air
yeah oh yes yeah like uh if like thinking of tesla's wireless transmission
exactly exactly like his tower what's his tower called
warden cliff tower warden cliff tower yeah yeah so he was talking about um
actually turning a layer of the atmosphere into
ionizing a layer of the atmosphere into a very good conductor
and then you just if you attach that to a source of electricity then you can just
plug into it anywhere else on the planet and draw power from it now that would
put load on the source but also that the source might
possibly become the sun it could be yes because the sun is dumping an enormous
amount of energy into the atmosphere all the time so it could become a sort of
free energy-ish thing you know uh it's like for the
kind of thing you have to build a tower anywhere you wanted to grab it
yeah you know yeah and then the other two pyramids he
says that those could have been like backups like backup generators or
something backup generators or test sites or
who knows right yeah i i love those kinds of ideas and
the great thing about that is it's just like let's do that you know but the
idea that they were tombs is just
no bodies were found you know like there's no writing
right we've been in tombs in egypt they're full of beautiful
artwork and writing i mean just covered the whole
every wall and the ceiling tells you a story there's stars it was painted it's
the tunnels are big enough for like a procession of people to carry the body
in you know a box or whatever all the way down to the bottom and then
there's traps in the box yeah there's big traps yeah
pit traps with enormous stone doors and the other side you know it's that you
can tell it's a tomb and and then you get in the pyramid and it's more like
walking around in a machine right yeah he talks about that nasa
engineer freedman freund or freedman this is in the new book
freund yeah in the new book yeah sorry chris i have the new book i haven't
started reading it yet yeah it's fucking i can't wait yeah and freedman
freund was he's known for his study on the
earthquake lights so i guess there's a bunch of places around the world where
he found there's a little their most seismic activity
and it could be days or weeks before an earthquake happens there's these lights
that come up out of the earth and they show up in the atmosphere they look
like ufos people have yeah have mistaken them for
ufos before and his sort of theory on this and what he wanted to test
is this could be a way to be early detection for earthquakes to avoid
catastrophe during earthquakes so if you see these earthquake quick lights
coming out and you're in a seismic activity
evacuate because there's going to be a or there's going to be an earthquake
and it was proven he proved that this actually happened he did they did test
they did studies and they they measured exactly when these earthquake lights
would come out of the ground and how much longer after that there would be an
earthquake and it's it's fascinating i do remember
you talking with chris about this on your show yeah and then so
so what he did was they took two big pieces of granite these big like
long square chunks of granite and they would they brought them into a lab
and they put some sort of um electronic conductors on the ends of them and they
rubbed them together and they found out it made electricity
when they rubbed these pieces of granite together
yeah that it's like a piezoelectric effect right yes yes
yeah flexing the quartz crystals in the granite is going to generate
generate electrical charge right yeah the other thing is you can't really
disconnect some of these other structures around like the
like this yeah what is this place this uh this is the valley temple
this is the same construction style
it's it's enormous limestone core blocks some of them
weigh hundreds of tons they're heavily eroded and then they've been cased in
granite and this granite has been clearly it's been
finished and flattened right like so the pyramid we're looking at a lot of them
were were sort of still puffy yeah these have been finished
right so inside this you know if you pulled these granite stones off you
would have limestone right behind them oh okay i can actually i can show you
is there pieces where the granite is removed yes
and you can see there's entire areas where
that used to be cased in granite that are not cased anymore and the limestone
itself has all these squarish like divots in it where you
could see like okay that was a block that was the back side of a granite block
that was sitting up against it because it's got this rectangular divot
in the limestone wall wow like the whole thing is made up of them
the whole limestone wall is made up of these divots of various sizes so you
can tell that it was completely encased in granite
and not so it's not only where the granite stones mating faces like
perfectly flat but they were flattened up against the limestone to the point
that the whole limestone wall is this is what the outside of oh my god
see the square indentations and rectangular marks on there but of
course this limestone is heavily eroded right right so it's very
yeah and you can see the size of the blocks like this you know
there's another place is that what kind of erosion is that that's the kint kawas
pyramid yeah this is kint kawas okay that is a pyramid that's the core of a
pyramid now that is the that is the bedrock limestone so they made the
bottom of the pyramid out of the bedrock they shaped because it's actually
like what they call a yardang which is like a protrusion of the bedrock
sticking up mm-hmm they shaped the bedrock into a pyramid it has the
slopes and then they cased it probably never seen this pyramid before
it's right there on the guiza plateau but it's just so heavily eroded and torn
apart it looks like why does it look like it comes out
when it goes up like this this third layer comes out wider than the
the second layer below it it might be the angle at which i'm taking it but it's
you know we're kind of it's just eroded yeah it's very eroded
is that water erosion is there any evidence of water erosion on it
i'm not qualified to answer this stuff up here is
you know very suggestive the way these these vertical erosion marks in this
you know uh but i just don't know this is definitely cut
these yeah oh yeah um but this is you know this is the outside of the valley
temple so that's the inside of it is still finished in granite but somebody
has come along and removed most of all of the granite casing out here but you
can see where they were cut to set against this
you know these squares are where that granite was cut to set against it yes
so let me let me move back to the um but this is there's some interesting stuff
in here when you're looking at this thing uh the the size of some of these
blocks uh like this one oh yeah on the right
here look at that thing oh wow look what you did there
that's magic that's magical i love that yeah i love how like that's what you're
showing earlier some of the blocks they they're like wider and then the fitting
the block that fits into it fits perfectly into that little
45 degree angle yeah this guy's like six foot eight
so i'll give you an example of how tall this block is
that's jiao ming this dude is tall then this one on the other side is also an
enormous block
but what's really interesting is when you get
uh the corners right so the corners here so i've drawn a line down the corner
and you'll notice that that giant block goes around the corner oh my god
oh way that's like that's like just arrogance that's like you're showing off
right well it's interesting because when we and
also you'll see this one here i didn't make any cool graphics for this one but
you know it's just like here's your layer but nope let's drop it down a
couple inches for this next part you know and let's give it a nice curve
let's not make it square you know just let's make it harder in itself so yeah
you're right it's kind of a uh what is it that um
well there's a quote from 2001 a space odyssey where he was talking about the
the geometric perfection of the monolith was a kind of mathematical arrogance
is what he said yeah and it's sort of i always think of that when you're
looking at this stonework because it's like they're just showing off dude
so here's another corner in a different part of the so you can sort of clearly
see the corner line yeah right and it looks like
uh the corner like i don't have good pictures of it here but when you walk
up close and look up that corner line has a regular radius
like it was drilled from the top all the way down
with a single tool i don't know if that's how they did it but it's square tool
like no it's not it's got a round radius right so the blocks come in and then
there's a curve where the corner is it doesn't it's not a perfect 90 degree
like there's a tiny bit of a curve like like there was a bit
that was used like a one inch drill bit they just went from the top of the wall
just all the way down drilled all the way down to the ground
so yeah so that's the corner now i'm not saying that's what they did
right it's what it looks like right it's like the radius is the same and there's
a cont and it's continuous across the blocks but also look this block goes
around the corner this block goes around both of the
all three of those go around this block goes around the corner and this one
goes around the corner here's a picture of another
oh my god so see that what the fuck yeah and notice notice the radius of the
corner like it's a continuous line going all the way down yeah it is a tool
yeah it's clearly it looks different than the faces of the wall
yeah like it just stands out yeah it's got a different sort of
aspect to it and you can see this one around the corner that one goes around
the corner this one goes around the corner yeah it reflects
differently than the rest of it yes and all the way up
they go around the corner and they mostly alternate and then you know just
this is my favorite right just in case you're in doubt about blocks going around
the corner yeah you got this block oh my god it is the fucking
corner
so you start to think how big was this initially you know like this block has
to go deep into the wall to the right and deep into the
wall to the left and all the way back into the you
know it's a that's a big damn block right there it's a and they've just cut
one corner of it off to make it the corner of this wall
that's absurd so this is what we came up with
let's say that you want to have a this is a top-down view yeah a top-down view
you want to make a chamber like we were just looking at right
yeah so you you you build big limestone casing blocks and you make a big
rectangular chamber here with you know limestone casing blocks then you
case the interior and irregular granite sort of puffy irregular granite now
notice when you're looking at these that none of these blocks these granite
blocks go around any corners right okay
then you go out onto the top of those granite blocks
and you find the place where you want the actual interior wall to be
this is where you want the surfaces of the wall to be it's inside the stone
right now okay then you drill four holes
at the corners of that interior future wall
then you go in with your magic granite flattening tool whatever that is
and you remove all that granite now you have four blocks that go
around corners yep and it makes total sense yep
we know that they were removing they were facing the granite
so if you if you had six or eight inches
we know that they were facing that pyramid at least you know 18 inches
deep yeah so yeah if you're going to go face it this is
what's going to happen in an inside corner
and we have there's places we can look at later like the osirian where
they were in the in the process of facing the wall and we can look at that too
yeah the osirian stuff is not yeah well that one more thing in the valley
temple is i'll just show you some of the joins
this is i'm just putting my fingers up there for for reference but there's a
horizontal join and a vertical one here right here
and here they're almost invisible yeah i mean look at that you can barely the
only reason you can see it is because there's like slight there's
erosion and there's slight discontinuities in the crystalline structures
basically right right right right otherwise it would be invisible yeah
so uh it's just so crazy that there's another one
oh my lord yeah so that's a you know this is a
this is an outside corner and it's just it's also very heavily
eroded it's really interesting how how deeply eroded this granite is and
granite is you know not a weak stone how long
does it take for it to basically begin to decompose like this
it is one of the hardest stones right it's like one of the top three hardest
stones yeah it's a seven i think on the most
scale nine being or was it is a diamond is a ten or is it nine
i can't remember i think it's a ten i thought it was a ten yeah
so it's seven and you know we had a geologist on one of the
the tours with us and he would look at this
you know he'd stand there looking at this like this decomposition of the
granite he's just like
you know i'm like how long does this take chuck and he's like a long time
a long time he wouldn't commit to a number he just
had a long damn time right
so it's just so wild to me like just try to imagine what those tools would have
looked like and there's zero evidence of
any of these tools and no remains yeah from any of these machines that they
would have used to do this no known yeah it's no no
i would love for there to be you know someday somebody finds a uh
like a an unopened tool an unopened chamber
well chris dunn talks about the you've heard about him the the tuning forks
that he mentions yeah the uh easy being the ones at the base of the
staffs is that what you're talking about well he said there was a row of giant
tuning forks in the um the grand gallery going
up to the king's chamber oh the metal tuning forks because he shows that
they're like the the shapes of them what he hypothesizes they
would have looked like whenever the explosion happened in the king's
chamber um it would have been like a
electronic explosion and there's burn marks on the top of the
grand gallery going all the way up where those tuning forks would have been
and he superimposed a graphic like showing what they looked like
and um he thinks that somebody stole those tuning i don't know if maybe there's
a there the helm holt's resonators is that what
we're talking about maybe yeah they're kind of a tuning fork there's a
conspiracy theory i found out there that there somebody found a photo of
some of these tuning forks they're like hidden away somewhere oh man somebody
like stripped him out of there and they're hiding him somewhere
yeah that's well see that's believable because
if you know if if you have ancient tools
and they're made of metals and other valuable things and then you know
civilization collapses and a long time goes by and then you have people who
are just trying to survive and they find sort of
rusting degrading remnants of tools they're gonna peel bits of metal off to
make knives right spears right they're gonna scavenge it
and whatever time doesn't destroy people will destroy if they can yes
you know and so there's just going to be nothing left and but if they used
hypothetically if they were using diamond cutters to cut this stuff we
would still have the diamonds like the remnants of the diamond right well our
diamond cutters our diamond cutters are coated in dust yeah there's an
entire desert full of sand yeah and it's
you try to find diamonds and grains we talked about this yeah
you'd have you get a sifting sand hoping that one of those little bits of
silica is actually a diamond it's uh you know wouldn't the wouldn't the
structural or structural integrity of the diamond if it was a blade wouldn't
it still be intact or would it would it erode to dust
no we're thinking of dust to start with so you have like you know if they our
diamond blades are just coated in diamond dust
oh ours are yeah okay so yeah that's the cheapest kind of diamond to get is like
this dusty bork bort stuff right you get a you get a metal
blade and you set or you have some way of
setting the diamonds into the metal so as the metal is wearing away it
wears away and there's a new diamond in there
oh that starts scratching the stone until that one gets worn off falls out and
then there's more underneath and you can keep wearing that blade down that's
embedded with diamond ah i studied i understand i was
picturing like like a pure diamond saw blade
yeah shows how much i know i'd like to have a diamond sword
that'd be cool that would be sick
yeah so yeah that's what i was thinking of i don't you know
the same guy chuck was talking about making you know kind of doing this as a
test by pouring i can't remember exactly what he was
doing but pouring some kind of metal that he had put a
bunch of diamond into into some kind of grinding disc and you can
he's trying to kind of do these little experiments to say well maybe they were
doing it this way and you don't have to have diamond
you just have to have something harder than the stone that
that's in there or at least as hard as but you don't there's not many options
it's not a whole lot of options yeah what is there besides diamond
well quartz would cut most of granite except the quartz in the granite that's
the problem but it will scratch itself it will scratch itself but the you know
the hardest thing in granite is the quartz you're just gonna wear through so
many bits i just don't they should be everywhere
yeah um this is great because it gives people a real idea of
how far away these places these complexes are yeah giza and minkara are up
there in the north near the you know near the big delta
right the osirian is 300 miles south up the nile
um and that's what that's the next place we look at here in this
uh this is it's next to the you know the the the temple of seddie the first
that's what this is to the this is the temple this is above ground
okay big massive beautiful temple it's one of the you know it's still got its
roof on it which is uh a lot of the egyptian
do these dynastic temples no longer have the the roofing blocks on
so this one does and it's it's cool to go in there and just you know it's dark and
cool and there's these holes that shine these beams of light down on certain
parts that move around during the day you know
it's an amazing experience to walk around in here and the carvings are
beautiful but then you get down into you know
this thing this is the osirian so this is outside the temple
and it's like 40 30 to 40 feet below ground surface
so it's but it's underneath the ground like a like a basement
this is looking down into it holy cow so you can see if you're looking in the
back there you can see the you know the cliff walls there that's all
nile sediment so this thing is deep down in you
know in nile sediments uh and you can see that it's in the water table the
green at the bottom right water right
but this is just the top of this structure it actually goes down another
like 30 meters it's got multiple levels below this
you know that we've never accessed well i think people have dug down into it
yeah there's some very old pictures from before the dam was built when they
were digging it out and you can see that these were deep pits
which is part of what makes this structure so strange and mysterious like
just like the pyramids when you're walking around in here you just don't
kind of you don't feel like people were supposed to be walking around in here
in here yeah you sort of feel like you know like you
you accidentally found the basement access to a you know to a skyscraper
building and you're down there where all the the machinery is and you're not
supposed to be there
wow so these these things full of water would have been
incredibly deep pits you know before they're full of now they're
full of water and in material and dust you see through the water no it's no
it's uh not good water there is some areas where
you can see through the water where the um the sediment and stuff that has
basically filled up these deep pits are you can see down there
uh-huh okay but there's also a stairway that just disappears into the water
yeah you can't see down there we need to get scuba divers
Strabo wrote about it and called it he said it was referred to as the well
yeah i know you're ready to do this right i'm not ready to see what happened
actually oh come on i mean you need you need the same kind of scuba divers that
were like scuba diving in chernobyl
those guys got balls my balls aren't big enough
oh check out the top you see the top uh the block on on the top first pillar
yes yeah let's cut that cut in it oh yeah yeah people were quarrying this stuff
those are quarry marks right these dash lines
is that what you're talking about it's it's like a notch cut out yeah it's got
an L shape on that top one oh here yeah right yes yes yeah like it's you know
it's it's made they've they've cut it like this so it's not going to move
or something it sets up against this block there are also
uh i can't remember if i've got pictures of this but they sort of tongue and
grooved these oh really yeah i can show you that in a minute
genius yeah but that yeah that column was basically split in half almost yeah
but look at this thing it's it's hard to describe the the sheer size of these
columns this is all granite also it's all granite and it's uh
now okay how do the people that give you these when you're going on these tours
of these places how what are these tour guides say about this stuff
when you say how do they do this what do they say
they don't they don't say anything like it's they're still next
i mean i haven't heard you know you use if we'll walk around in here and ask
questions just like giving a tour of this yeah that's what i'm saying
when if the tour guide tells you how they did this is not a good tour guide
yeah because we don't know right so there's no there's no explanation
i mean if there's accepted explanation if there's a standard well the standard
explanation is that seddy's engineers built this thing right so it's new
kingdom uh that they built it but it doesn't it's just it doesn't
look anything like his temple it's not the same at all and i'll show some
comparison pictures here the standard explanation would be
man power rope and sand and copper tools
copper and a bunch of guys dragging stones and whatever yeah
like that's the that's the standard i love the video
or the clip on ben's video where he's like on the pyramid looking down at a
tourist using the pounding stone he's like you're gonna be there a while
yeah yeah exactly yeah
but it's it's also interesting how they you know this you can see the water
lines on the bottom of this column yeah because the water would go up and down
um and just yeah they're just the enormous size of these columns
so there is a picture of a dynastic temple and just look at the difference in
everything the dynastic temple is covered in art and writing
every surface is telling you a story or giving you a picture of the night sky or
the stars or the pharaohs or and those columns are stacked pieces
correct there are column drums their discs basically stacked up and they
they did this in a very similar way they stacked up these puffy discs
then they came back and ground them into nice circular
but it's also limestone or sandstone much much softer
then they covered it in plaster and then they carved the plaster yeah
and and when you're walking around in these places and like you know notice
the tops of the columns like each one is like a plant it's a lotus or it's a you
know it's all these various different flower types up there it's beautiful
but you feel like people were supposed to be in here looking at the pictures
reading the stories it's open and airy and sort of
you know and beautiful and then you're in places like the assyrian or the
pyramid you're just like this is a machine i'm not supposed to be in here
this is a this is a giant pump or a power plant or yeah the assyrian is
definitely just the weirdest place to be because what's so weird about it it's
weird because there's no like weird in the sense of do i belong here
because the walkway the places where you can actually go are like there's too
narrow you know the it's you just and and if it
was empty of water and all the rubble it would be a huge drop off there yeah
i mean osha would be all over this thing you gotta have hand rails
no but uh yeah there's no there's no room to walk like in front of that small
door back there yeah there's like a ledge about a foot wide or something
yeah well i'll show some pictures of that in a minute for sure so it just
it's just strange it's like you know there's no place like that in any of
the temples everywhere you go in the temples it's it's
open and the floor is big enough for multiple people to walk side by side
the doorways are large you know but it's still a doorway
it is yeah which is so confusing it's a doorway to a tiny room
have you ever no decorations have you been in like you know
there was a what we grew up in georgia and there was some like abandoned
like base you know like a fort binning i can't remember what it was some
some it was like barracks yeah barracks and other things and like
like large buildings and they had big concrete slabs and but all the stuff
inside had been taken out so in the concrete slab there would be just
unexplained sockets and holes where machinery used to sit oh yeah
you know okay and it's like you feel like that in the pyramids and in some of
these places where you're looking at these and you're like something was
mounted here sort of like what you were talking about with chris saying in the
grand gallery that you there were these tuning forks or
home holds resonators mounted in these slots going all the way up the grand
gallery right you look at the you know like what is this
little alcove what is this hole in the floor it's like stuff was put
stuff was here you know it's just gone because it was metal or it was valuable
or it was the machine that was taken out and now we just are left with the you
know the superstructure or whatever right you can see quarrying attempts here
that's what this does notches yeah yeah like they would they would make these
notches and they'd put wooden wedges or something in here and try to split the
rock but that that was much later much later yes way later yeah yeah and
probably that rock was buried in sand yeah it was buried up to here so they
didn't know how deep it was so they just made notches hoping to get this corner
off there did not realizing that thing went all the way down to here so then
they tried to split it it just got gave them they broke the top off and then they
quit right yeah i mean that's a guess no one really knows the other thing is look
how the everything here is a guess look how the uh the columns are actually set
in their own that's bizarre counter sunk uh sockets do we do you can you tell
how far down that column goes well that's that's interesting because here's
another one you can see it's in its own socket but then there's this in the
middle so and you can see it's very faint here but you can see around the edge
that there's the here's the socket and then there's this deep
part so there's a small depression there's a small depression around the
edge like what the others want so they like notched the bottom of the stone
that was sitting in there to where that it would cover the outside but then go
deeper that's the question so instead of just
something simple like this where you're sitting a big block down on your floor
you actually built something more complex and interesting like this
and then yes plug that in that is impressive so you got these
enormous you know multiple hundred ton or whatever i don't know what what are
these estimated to weight i don't know hundred tons maybe these columns and
you like okay if i put that down it's not gonna move
but no we're gonna make sure by sock we're gonna plug it into the floor
you know that's what it that's that's actually
a question we don't know because we haven't looked at the bottom of one of
these columns or whatever yeah this is weird so this is what we're Kyle was
talking about the you're trying to walk and you got a kind of like indiana
jones your way around you're leaping across you know puddles of radioactive
water it could also have been a
like a wooden walkway over this it could have been yeah there could have been a
floor but it's see that that thing that we're looking at there that's full of
water was a very very deep pit like it there are old
pictures where it just goes down into darkness really fell off there you
would break your neck yeah it's like it's not an insubstantial
thing it's you know but you're right i mean there could have been a wood
right you could or or or something else covering it yes
can we find the pictures of this with no water
maybe he can look them up online old pictures of the osirian when they were
first excavating it osirian excavations like osiris
irion oh siri i always have to look up the
spelling of that word every time osirion osirion or something like that
osiron osirion yeah so uh this is the other
looking the other way in this same channel look at those these are the only
three that i know of remaining roofing blocks that's
ceiling blocks those they're huge
that cross the top so these massive things and they're what what do you
think how 24 probably like 24 35 feet up there
and they're the blocks themselves are maybe like five foot thick yeah
so it's like five feet thick up this way and you know so so
what you're looking at here that you got a column and then on top of the column
are these things spanning the column like a lentil yeah a lentil going across
and then across that were these gigantic
these things and most of those have been they're all gone
yeah they're part of this rubble you know whatever there's pieces of them
lying around um and then you know you're looking
at this outer wall so are those like parts that stick out more are
those like parts of those knobs that were yeah nubs yeah nubs yeah
yeah so you notice that this wall has like the the blocks again are unfinished
they're puffy right and they have nubs on them there
there's two nubs there and then you can see here like there's just a whole
bunch of interesting stuff here there's indentations
there's this one here uh and then these inserts
these little tiny inserts now i i we saw a whole lot of these things
and you know initially you imagine like this tiny little rock goes all the way
through to the back like it's a big you know
that's not what it does it's actually possibly it looks like it was a cosmetic
fix so okay this uh the one on the left would be a better
example that the corner of that block may have been
chipped off now this is the exterior right this is
inside this is inside sirion has no exterior because it's
it's underground yeah right yeah it's a hole but
but basically if the right corner of that block had been
broken or chipped away then instead of just leaving it
avoid they carve out a little square notch and then put a little block in
there hmm it doesn't go all the way through and
there was one on an outside corner that we
confirmed does not go all the way through the wall it just was to fix a
corner that had been chipped away yeah i used to have that picture in here i
took that one out how dare you take that picture wow yeah
so it yeah so if you broke the corner off here and then you just insert this
in too so that when you finish the wall you don't have a hole right right
that's the idea but it's also interesting how all of this is granite or
no this is this is this is a this is like a this is granite
is a granite yeah inside those rooms is fort side or something there's some
yeah there is some other kind of stone yeah but this outside here is is granite
and then like the other thing notice here all along this
central block is this angle or the right layer change
course change like the whole the whole course just shifts down an inch or two
around this sort of central small block here in the middle like i love these
kinds of little design details yeah um
and then if you look at the whole surface you can see you know again there's
nubs all over the place uh and then there's these
strange interesting scoop marks those are a couple of clear ones like somebody
was scooping material off of the surface of the block
uh and then there's this strange thing that we found when we were looking at
this i'll just show you this real quick there is
something here what the oh my god where this little tiny sliver of this block
goes underneath the other one now this is what i this is when i start to
think about like the engineer is just like you know what this wall needs right
here yeah
you i i need this block to have a half inch thick thing that sticks out to the
left like yeah it's just ridiculous so i think this is
another example of of the the building of this wall actually
shapes the wall itself yeah like it you know you don't think there was an
engineer that demanded it like i need this whole layer functional right there
i need this whole layer to drop down one quarter of an inch
and i want it to happen inside the to get it resonate
resonating at the right frequency you had to have that little notch
if that's the case you'd have to give serious credit to those contractors
yeah they would be like okay yeah we're actually gonna do that yeah
we got no problems nowadays they'd be like well the other the other thing
about this entire job like looking at it as a job site is that
everything is very nothing is straight up and down
the out these outer walls are very slightly angled out
like this yes outwards and then all the columns are very slightly tapered
inward as they go up and it does this weird thing with negative space
right so the space that's far away from you is bigger
than the space right in front of you so it all looks the same size because you
have this natural foreshortening as the space goes far away but because it's
actually getting bigger the it it looks messes with your head
it messes with how far away it looks yeah so can you imagine you're like yeah i
want my whole house built but i want the outside walls to tilt
outwards one degree and i want everything on the inside to tilt
inward one degree you know can you imagine what your contractor would say to
you if you told him that yeah i imagine
no that's fucking insane man yeah again it's the design details that you see
you know that are just are fascinating yeah so here again look at the
look across the top of the courses we're looking at that same wall but i'm on
the i'm up i'm up outside of the thing zooming in okay
look at these huge scoop marks taken out of the tops of these blocks like
somebody was removing an enormous amount of material
kind of in a rough fashion get it and i think they were getting ready
to smooth this wall out what do you think about the idea that they had a way
to make the stone softer so they could do this kind of
stuff yeah the geopolymer idea like i well not
full geopolymer necessarily but not like softening like a way to make it
softer this year chris dunn talked about this a
little bit yeah i have a hard time with granite
being softened i don't know it could it could be possible like you know
basically the the you're just you already are thinking of
non-conventional completely unknown ways of working with stone
and so like to rule something out completely is
shouldn't do it but it's just not i you know it's
i think that there are other ways but yeah maybe they could soften it
could you use some kind of uh like i don't know some kind of electromagnetic
something to just make it to change the but there are in nature if there are
interesting legends about this supposed thing that could soften stone
or cut stone like a shamir yeah what's the shamir that's it
it's basically a tool for working with stone and they're
just strange legends of it that i know one of them is in the
uh what do they call it's like the legend of solemn or some of the
some of the stuff in the apocryphal texts yeah the the tales of the jews
so the story of solemn and you know he has
he he basically gets this ring from god that allows him to control all the
demons and the demons have all these different
abilities and stuff and he he ends up convincing one of them like hey i gotta
build this temple i need you to i'm not allowed to use iron
or anything to cut it yeah so he's supposed yeah god is like you i need
you to build my temple and you may not use iron on any of the stone
yeah so he convinces this demon to uh tell him where the secret
tool is or whatever and it's out in the middle of the desert and it's
you know there's this weird story about a bird that is protecting it
and the bird uh the way to the way to get the tool from the bird
is you trick the bird into thinking its nest is being attacked and then it
uses the shamir and then you can grab it
it's essentially something like that's a really strange story yeah
uh and that's apparently where does the story come from
it's in the the legends of the jews it's like the legend of the jews legends
yeah like it's a collected works of old oral
you know traditions and things and other written works of the
of the jews about solemn and ancient times like this specific story has been
has fascinated us for a long time like the kind the concept that
one of the things that solemn got when he asked for god for wisdom
was the ability to control all these demons like he knew their names
and he had this ring and then he could command them and because each one of
them had all these had specific superpowers basically all of those
superpowers were at his you know he could use them
and when does when do these oral traditions or texts when do they say
that this was do they have do they give you any sort of idea
when was the time of solemn i don't know i don't i don't think they give dates
yeah
yeah they're like can you compare the time of solemn
3000 bc yeah yeah like when was solemn i don't know i don't know when was the
time of david yeah it's like right oh no yeah wow
i'm not sure i i it's possible that information's out there i just don't
know i typically take these types of stories like
i i wonder about this is this a story that is a lost
like in other words if you were tried to describe
a modern lathe for example when you have completely lost all of the
knowledge of what a lathe is but you just
know that it does that it can magically do stuff with
stone or wood or metals or maybe even materials you don't even understand
so how would you tell a story about it right you know they
so it's like the idea that a bird is protecting this
this tool that can just manipulate stone with ease
makes me wonder is like is the bird important was it in other words those
people that use the tool could also fly they could fly
yeah so that's the kind of way i look at these stories
is that what there is or it's hidden up in the mountains
because yeah that's where the bird is supposed to be is up high you know yeah
this is kind of like what we were talking about last night right like if we
were what if a comet hit the earth tomorrow and wiped out everything
that we have and we had to talk to our kids about like what the iPhone was
how would we describe the iPhone we would say oh it was this magical square
we held and we could connect to everything across the world yeah yeah
yeah so before you would be able to talk to your family yeah
somebody who never saw it or touched it would be so it would be so hard to
describe in words yeah yeah and eventually a thousand or
two thousand years later people would be taking their little stone tablets
altogether to go outside to get service yeah yeah to get reception
right so they can talk to their ancestors so they can talk to their ancestors
it's you can see how these things could turn into these types of belief well the
people of old you know knew these great powers yeah in the golden age and the
time of the gods you know they had these powers and they could
answer any question they saw you could see any part of the earth from anywhere
right mm like all of these sounds like gods
yeah it come like and these are actual you know these ideas that they could see
far they could see instantly to any place that they
wished like these are actually in ancient myths like these
same statements about ancient peoples and so when you nowadays where you're
looking at Google Earth or you're you're asking Syria a question or whatever
you're like is this what they're talking about something like this like that
they had a that they had a very advanced civilization
you know and they had fully computerized and that's what's great about
Ben's work and you know and these other people like Chris Dunn
that are doing with the vases yes that they're basically giving you a smoke and
gun saying you can't explain this except with advanced tooling
right and the kind you know to make a five axis
mill that can make something like these vases with the precision it has
requires an enormous industrial civilization to get all the metals to
like you know manufacture all the stuff to have all the precision
to make the bearings like Chris was telling you it's not a simple task
right you can't make a wooden lathe and get the precision that you get with
these vases right and then you know any five axis tool
has to be controlled by something you know like a computer
something like it doesn't have to be exactly like what we have but you
like in other words turn to turn a design into into analog motion
yeah you know the motion of a machine from a design
there's no there's no real good way to do that
without a computer so suddenly we have the
basically the vases and the precision on the vases is
good evidence to take another look at these structures and say what are we
really looking at here and to take a little another look at the myths
and the ideas of the times of the gods and that you know the time of the
anunnaki of the shining ones or whatever these people that seem to come out of
the sky and were very advanced and powerful and may have ruled over
other places you know with their technological tools
they don't have to be aliens they could just be humans from an advanced
civilization from somewhere else on the planet
right like us compared to some of these uncontacted tribes right now
we were talking about last night like look how advanced we are we have iPhones
and and fucking uber but yeah these people are
still living in the same time as us that are wearing
fucking loincloths and throwing six foot spears
buttflaps and Birkenstocks yeah
they're in the Stone Age yeah they are it's crazy
and that there's no reason why that couldn't have happened in the past as
well and it's probably anytime i i think
there's may have been multiple times that
hominids have been advanced there's no reason why they couldn't
have and they lived alongside Stone Age
peoples and then if anything was destroyed this is
kind of one of the things that Graham Hancock talks about it's like once the
once your great civilization is destroyed and all of these systems
that you have built that everyone relies on to survive
you've forgotten how to be a hunter-gatherer there's only going to be
a few people in your society that really do that
that know how to do that know how to go out and and just
get the resources from the ground yeah the people who are still hunter-gatherers
or the preppers who no one likes right so those are the guys that end up
surviving so if there was a cataclysm today
those would be the guys that survive those would be the ones that survive
and they would if if how would they tell our story
if people from our civilization went to seek refuge with them
yeah right like our entire civilization fell i need your help maybe some of
them would be killed some of them would survive
some of them would learn the hunter-gatherers language would then be able
to transfer some of our knowledge to them
maybe give them help them yeah so it learn some
new concepts right and then they're so to those people it's like ah they were
the ones flying in the sky they were the bird people
yeah you know or they were the ant people they were mining in the ground
they were bringing up all this stuff out of the ground
and so in some places the you know we would be like varicotia to them yes
yeah or the anunnaki right you may have in
some places the survivors go and they and they become like tyrants
they use their the technology they save and they become rulers and they're
you know god kings and in other places they're like vita coach i'm here to help
you you know let me show you about agriculture and
like building structures and you know yeah i'm peaceful peaceful yeah
peacefully yeah don't make the same mistakes we did right
that sort of thing but i just and the other thing is it's like all the big
cities and all that kind of stuff they'd have been on the coasts
they'd have been in the river valleys yeah they're all gone
they're buried yeah 400 foot sea level rise gets rid of
a lot of coastal cities like all of them where would Giza what would Giza have
looked like like how Giza's on a plateau
already so it's on a plateau or so it would have been off-lipped but that was
that was all during that time 12,000 years ago it would have been all green
right yeah it's like it would it would have been
much more lush than it is now yeah like if you go back
i think what was it at least 9,000 bc you begin to get rainfall
like a lot of rainfall there and then it becomes green as you keep going back
yeah so it would have been a not exactly sure about those dates but yeah
somewhere around there yeah mm-hmm yeah don't don't uh
don't quote me on that but look we have that kind of stuff here like
like it's one of the things that's been fascinating me lately is this the
the footprints in white sands new mexico yeah
yes there's hundreds of thousands of footprints there
there was a whole society of people that lived on this
this ancient lake that's now dry right there's a dried up lake bed
and the footprints of those people and the animals that they lived with are
all there preserved and it's
it's now been very successfully dated to be around like 23,000 years old
and it wasn't too long ago that scientists believe that
nobody was here at that time no humans were here
they thought they came over the Bering land bridge or whatever like the first
humans ever to get onto the american continent
was like between 12 and 15,000 years ago
is what they thought before that no humans had ever been here ever
how did they so when they found these footprints in white sands
how did they date that it was something thousand years ago it was
something having to do with seeds that were in the
like at that time the the sediments that were
what's the word at the same time as the footprints were made
have seeds of plants that were flowering or whatever at that time and they
and the seeds are like pushed down into the mud by the footprint oh wow
and so they were able to carbon date those something like that
i don't remember yeah there's a couple of other they have multiple
lines of evidence now because people question they're like that's too early
yeah it was it was debated for a while and it's very pretty conclusive at this
point how big are the footprint like do they
think that the people looked similar to us like same size as us or they think
they were like small or big or well the famous ones are anything about that
just they're like yeah they think they were either like teenager
or a young woman yeah they're playing there's a little smaller than
you know little smaller yeah there's one set that particularly
fascinates me which is they think it's either a young man or a woman and
they're walking very brisk walk right really
fast along they they say the banks of the lake in other
words it's a straight line the line goes for a
mile and doesn't deviate more than a meter from straight
so a very straight line so the idea that that just walking in the mud along
this lake shore uh the the set of tracks goes out
and occasionally stops and then there's a tiny little set of
tracks that circle around like a child and then
it's just her tracks and then again a rest stop and the child
so she's carrying the kid a child a toddler or something like that
really fast along the bank of this lake and after she passes
a sloth a giant sloth comes by and arrives at her set of tracks and then
stands up on its hind legs and looks around and then gets back down on all
fours and keeps going crosses her tracks another occasion a mammoth
goes across her tracks and then a short time later
she comes back along the same set of tracks walking beside her own tracks
now no longer brisk walk and no child
and those tracks were not trampled by thousands of animals
in the days and months and years ahead into the future no
something happened very shortly after those tracks were made
that caused them to be buried and only and preserved yeah
23,000 years later what was that you know what i'm saying
fucking cool that is crazy dude yeah that kind of stuff just
fascinates me so i mean like how many times
what was she doing with the kid what was going on i mean it's like
so a giant sloth came along and stole her baby
no no it just encountered her tracks probably smelled
her scent stood up on his hind legs looked around but she had already passed
yeah mammoth just walks by he doesn't care yeah mammoth doesn't care
yeah maybe he was being ridden by it but then she came back though without the
kid yeah without the kid like the idea like you know the first
thing i thought was she was bringing the kid to some other family
on the other side of the lake or something like that right she's delivering
you know she's like here's your child but going really fast but she's running
like practically running yeah with this child yeah and then having to
take a break put the kid down and it runs around yeah pick it back up
boom keep going so she's like in a hurry well a mile is all they've uncovered
yeah we don't know how far she actually went and the crazy part is it was
preserved immediately after that yeah because there's i mean there's so many
animals that live along this live at this lake that if
nothing drastic had happened those footprints should have been
destroyed by other animals and birds and wave action wave action and from the
sediment shoreline yeah so something happened
and they were preserved and i mean it had to have been fairly quickly
after she made those tracks that's the thing that gets me what could have
happened
if there was a significant rise event in the lake
therefore no more animals were walking along that part to to
disturb no more waves would ever disturb that area of the sediment and the
lake just suddenly became deeper yeah then every year the lake
varves would form from the natural sediments that are just sort of
raining in and the water all the time leaves and whatever they'd fill in the
eventually fill in the footprints and then later if the lake dried up there
might be some sediment on top that dries up but they would never be
disturbed down there yeah so that could have happened and that's like a lot of
the footprints that they find they they can tell that they're you know they're
actually still under sediment and they can kind of you can break it off there
and get you know or just scan it and see it
without actually disturbing it but they say that like it's certain mornings
when when all the environmental conditions are right like there's dew
on the ground or whatever you can see these little spots
on the surface that are showing you that there's a hidden footprint below
oh really yeah by the way the water collects or the the dew or something
it's like a little tight slight temperature change yeah
I mean looking at some of the um the stuff that Randall goes and looks at
in the like on the west coast the uh scatlands yeah and those how he talks
about what were they like 100 megatons of water
flowing through the earth at like hundreds of miles an hour
when the comets hit and melted the ice caps like if the water was rushing at
that volume at that speed it would just I would imagine everything would just be
fucking vaporized yeah just ripping up everything in his path
yeah I mean and then of course you know you'd have tumbling boulders following
all that and they're just grinding the surface up yeah yeah there are huge
potholes in this get like you know it's 50 60 feet across this giant hole in
the ground drilled into basalt from just a whirlpool by a whirlpool that was in
the water during the flood boulders and gravel in there just like acting like a
big drill right right it's nuts god that place is insane
you guys went there yeah we've been three times I think yeah it's amazing
yeah yeah yeah that's so crazy man gotta gotta
detangitize yeah we'll go back from white sands people
people could have done this many times in the past
get back to the Shamir there could have been technologically advanced
things that cut stone back to the Osirian look at the way they cut this
stone yes wow you remembered all the tannins that's
fucking impressive they were completely detangitized so you're now
are looking at these scoot marks were they using some kind of advanced tool
here right and it definitely looks like they
were going to you know they were in the process of getting ready to flatten this
wall and we actually we know that that's what they were doing because they were
flattening the wall this is the part of the same wall and you can see that they
were coming along and just shaving off the excess material somehow it really
looks like shaving it yeah yeah and their razor was about
they had a nice razor wide yeah wow dude diamond razor bruh squeegee like a
diamond squeegee look at the look at the little yes
just like a squeegee you see these little I don't know what to call them
these are just a rim it would be streaks if you were using a squeegee right
exactly but it's actually extra it's a ridge of stone where the
the tool was being removed from the working surface as it got to the edge
here it looks like when they pour concrete
floors they take those big things on the sticks and they drag them across it to
smooth it yeah yeah but this is actually
trowels that's what it is yeah like a trowel but they're just how do you just
or a bull float yeah here's another image of the same
surface there from and they were gonna what they were gonna what is like a
penguin in the side of that rock right there
what are you talking about a car this right here
I never even thought of that maybe is that what that was
I think it's like it's like it's like it's a nub you know it's just the
remnants of a nub if your tool has like a lip on each side
because it's holding like say a rotary disc or something then you have
leftover spots that need flattening right yeah it doesn't look like they have
any any anything like that it's like a spinning
drum or something that if it was grinding the stone
that's the question what was the cutting action was it grinding I would it
seems to me like it would be grinding
now was the grinding done by vibration or was it done by spinning something
who knows and it doesn't have to be all the same tool like you know if you're
if I've done a lot of painting of houses and you know you use a roller
because it covers a lot of surface but to get up into the corners you got to use
a small brush you gotta cut it in yeah so you have different tool yeah you got
you get different tool tips or whatever but yeah it's just this is just
fascinating to me and like you know so again you can see that this work is
unfinished that somebody was in the process of doing the
finishing work and they just didn't quite what they didn't have time they
ran out of time that it just it but it looks like people
put their tools down one day and then just never came back to the job but
this also it kind of explains why you have these tiny
little insert stones in the corners because if there was a if that corner
was chipped out you'd want to put this little insert in there because you knew
that when you came back to flatten it when you flattened it that little
insert would flatten off and it you would not have any voids in the wall
mm-hmm yeah right so it's like you can see
into the mind of the builders here like what their intentions were for this wall
yeah and the arrows here just pointing out the the sort of
scoop marks at the bottom that we were just talking about right the other thing
that's great about this is there's like when we were talking earlier about why
blocks go around corners there's great evidence for this here if you look in
the corner here this block goes around the corner
here's the corner right here and this block goes around the corner so you
know because they were flattening this wall that this block had extra
material and it got flattened and now it goes around the
corner right
wow
so yeah so again is it there it's all these little details and when you're
starting when you start to look at the the construction style
you know like how were they achieving these
surfaces or whatever then you start to see like this this really mysterious
things about blocks going around the corner it's part of the the process
you know it's a result of the process did you see any other places like this
or any other structures that had blocks going around corners like this
or are there any other places you're aware of in Peru they do in Peru yeah
they go around corners okay yeah yeah and they're smooth like this
yeah well i mean we were looking at the the valley temple just a little while
ago and i don't know that's far away in each that's on the guiza plateau yeah
so this is the i don't know if that's what you meant
but yeah i mean there's those blocks go around corners those blocks are too
yeah so they that's why i'm saying like it looks like
the valley temple was completed because there aren't any pillowy rocks on the
outside they had flattened the entire thing yeah
so you don't have but this clearly shows evidence that
that they that the style of building was to build with this excess material on
the stone it protects that that finished face that will
eventually be there once you do the flattening
once all of this major stonework is done
and this is why you get this appearance of rocks going around the corner it's
not necessarily the engineers saying like i need this
cornerstone to go around the corner by an inch and a half
it's just a it's it's a result of this style of flattening the face
after you were done yeah with the construction but you can also imagine
that the engineer knows that and he's planning this in
right yeah because a lot of cases you see that it alternates it alternates
perfectly yeah sometimes it doesn't sometimes there will be two blocks from
the same side that go around the corner like their teeth that fit together
but that would be a result of just like bricks like you have one brick like
this in the corner the next one goes this way and that's that's the result
that that the blocks alternate going around the corner
exactly it's the same deal yeah but it's not like that and the rest of it
like the stagnating it's only in the corners well the going around the
corners will will will go back and forth yeah it's
they're they're not bricks they're all different sizes but they do
they do have that that basic like interlocking corner
yeah whether the blocks are all the same size or not
still the same principle right then if you even if you did this with a brick
wall but it yeah they would go around corners in
alternating exactly courses exactly so where are we going
next here at the quarry aswan another 300 miles away
yeah 200 more miles so like the total you know 500 miles from guiza
200 miles from the osirian what was it like like what
sort of shit were you running into on that drive
from osirian to the quarry well we get to do that on the boat which is way better
than driving oh you took the boat the whole way yeah ride the Nile bro you
rode down the Nile yeah yeah what was that like it's it's amazing and
beautiful and just peaceful you know you like the the first
parts of the tour when you're in Cairo you're doing a lot of
driving you know going to sites or whatever
and then you you know we go to the museum and then we get on a plane and we
fly to Luxor and then from there we get on the boat
okay and we go all the way to oswan on the boat and so you're just
the boat will will cruise for a couple of hours stop you get off the boat the
sites right there or maybe you have to drive a little bit
you know but usually the sites right there some of them are right on the
river oh wow so it's it's uh it's yeah it's the
yeah it's great yeah lots of partying on the boat lots of what kind of boat how
big is the boat they're you know they're like river cruise boats
they're all they all have to be the same size because they have to fit through
the canal the the locks there's a lock that lifts them up
right they look like pontoon boats but they're like three or four stories
oh yeah four stories and lots of booze on 60 feet wide or something they have
some bars they're all standard yeah yeah there's a little pool on top
yeah you know yeah water slide casino is there a water slide no casino no
fuck let me know when they get casinos all head over there
so this is a google earth view of the quarry so you can see the
you know the rock outcrop there this grand this big granite piece
sticking out of the ground that's been quarried for thousands and thousands of
years this whole section wow and the whole fucking
city is just built around it yeah yeah all these people around it and you can
see this thing that is the oh that's the obelisk
that's the unfinished obelisk and it's like you know that thing is huge yes
yeah so we'll be looking at in a minute but there's there's a whole bunch of
interesting stuff the quarry is full of interesting stuff because you're looking
at lots of different tool marks like i said everyone's used it
you know from the from the ancients possibly these mysterious people who
built this stuff earlier the dynastics used it the the greeks used it the
romans used it you know the everyone has used it all the way up into the modern
times um at least until it became an archaeological site
so this is like this is standard what you would expect to see with chiseling
like if you look at this granite it's it's been chiseled it's not it's a nice
uniform chiseling but those are chisel marks these are also this is roman
chiseling here and here just to show you what what that
kind of looks like you know sort of striated lines
yep then we have these marks which we've
seen some of these this is a you know the split
quarrying technique where you're splitting the rock so they would make these
divots into the rock and then drive wedges in there notches
and then drive wedges in there right and break it and then break it off
yeah it's called the feather and wedge technique this is the kind of tools
that were used uh this is what it looks like
you drill a bunch of holes you put these in you drive them in in a regular
fashion it splits the rock and this is what we do today this is the modern
version of it yeah it looks like that
then we have these you know you look at this and you're like well
that doesn't look like either one of those techniques
but the work would have been in between those square divots in the part that
looks just broken off so they they made those divots and then the
piece in between them was the work that they took broke it
off yeah so so right here it's broken so what
they did was they cut a trench down this side and cut a trench down this side
and then started cutting inward and then they just split the block which was
sitting above this off the bottom here they break it off so that's what this
is so but the question is is how are they trenching these
because this is basically you're looking at the bottom of the trench now
right here's more of them and this is where you get the
the dolerite pounding stone the guys yeah yeah yeah yeah they tell you this
this you get this fantastic propaganda video when you go to visit this quarry
like everybody you you pull up in the buses and you get funneled in to
like a little it's the only place the only place where this happens and it's
like you know you can tell that they know that people are going to get in here
and be like how do they do this so they have to tell you first so you don't
start making up crazy stories right and so you
there's there's a bunch of seats and you're watching this little tiny tv
with everybody in there and it's zahi awa showing you that they're pounding
with you know using pounding stones and is it really him doing it zahi is in
there yeah yeah oh it's great we you know when we go
with uh with ben you you know you get uh everybody
starts cheering when zahi shows up because it's all sarcastic you know
we're all like yeah buddy oh my god that's amazing
so there's another set of the you know anomalous
quarry marks in there these are kind of it's like this weird stair step i got
another picture here looking up this same set look at that
and how they're very regular you know this is uh i don't know the 18 to 24
inches wide and you know that you can kind of
see it's it's difficult sometimes but you can kind of see how they're a
continuous it's a continuous trough that goes all the way up
and then they have these regular places where it goes down
right and that kind of continues all the way along here so it's it's like
something is scooping out and scooping out scooping out
it looks like a like something on an articulated arm
here's another really great example of that yeah that's that's just
ridiculous and notice notice how there is a
a kind of an angle change from here going across to here
right where this is like scooping straight across but as they get farther
this way it begins to sort of tilt it has this curve in it
what do you think that was about it it looks like something
that has a central position rotating on an articulating arm like think of a
backhoe but maybe more complex i don't know yeah so if you're
if you're digging with a like a mini excavator or something like that and
you go right in front of the machine it's going to be moving like this
right towards you and then if you get way out it's moving more vertically
the arm is right right so as you move closer and closer if you were looking
at a wall of a ditch that was dug when it's to the left side it would be
vertical marks and then the closer it got to that machine it started to slant
towards the machine be more uh yeah so it kind of looks like some kind of
does kind of look like that there's a radius yeah that matches the the
changing angle of these marks interesting like somewhere is you if you knew
what we were looking at you could figure out where the center of the machine
was or where it was rotating from right dude it left a lip
you see the top part yes yeah yeah yeah this up here yeah
oh my god here's another here's another great example of how these can be long
continuous marks so you can see it goes all the way up and every one of them is
regular going all the way down this wall and there's an interesting sort of
there's a there's a discontinuity in the granite here
that kind of goes along here and there's also a color change right maybe
indicating a shift in the material type or quality
and so it's like they were scooping off this good stuff above it and then
sort of ending the you know the digging right right here at the uh
where this material change starts i don't know if that's what's really
happening just looks like that it's an interesting thing
and then here's the obelisk how long is that roughly ah i think i may have the
information yeah here we go oh my god 137 feet yeah 41.75 meters
rough you know estimated 1200 tons that's 2.4 million pounds or 1.09
million kilograms 137 huh never realized that yeah
137 feet is that a sacred number it's a it's a number that physicists worry
about yeah it's the why it's the fine structure constant
i don't ask me what that is
one over 137 is the fine structure constant is it yeah okay yeah we i don't
that's all we know yeah all we know is that physicists worry about this
number and so it's interesting when it shows up
um so yeah again you can see now now that we've looked at these marks all over
the core you can see it's very faint here because they were sort of making a
nice finish serve but you see this grid yeah yeah yeah and then there's a some
like somebody dug a little deep here like they they they you know they bore
down a little hard on their belt sander and you know dug into the material but
it's like they're again think back to all the other
structures we're looking at where we know that they their standard method was to
deliver stones from the quarry with lots of excess material
that would be removed on site so you can imagine that this thing has
maybe it could have a foot of excess material on each side like it was going
to be a much thinner and smaller thing right now they're
you know they're cutting it out and of course they say this is the largest
one ever found or ever known about it would have been had it been
completed yeah so it makes sense if it had all that
excess material on it that it's going to be larger than any of the completed
ones yeah because eventually when they get it to
the site and they're ready to stand it up they they face it
right well let's get we look at this again so this one once 137 feet
1200 tons the largest existing standing obelisk is 105 feet and only 455
tons so this is the you know the largest ones that they successfully
constructed where is that one it's now in Rome I believe
oh wow it was stolen right and is it the same material
yeah I think so okay it's granite yeah yeah I think so
oh man I might not be in Rome I don't remember where the ladder in is
it's no longer in Egypt I don't think but so this is the front of the unfinished
obelisk cross on top of it so it's probably not yeah and you can see like
they were already making it sort of obelisky right they were giving it the
pointed tip right shaping it already but look at also look at the trenches
the trenches are insane this is the most detailed photo ever seen of those trenches
yeah and then you see the the test pit to the left there yeah they dug way down
this is what they call them test pit to test the quality of the stone right
see what it was like yeah that's the idea yeah
but yeah just you know just look at the the depth of the trench here
and it's very regular it seems can you very interesting how wide is that little gap that
trench can you stand in there yes yeah yeah it's wide enough for you to stand somewhere
between three and four feet wide maybe you think oh my god three feet three feet yeah
yeah now what are the what are the tour guides say when you get here
I want to know this there there aren't any oh there aren't any this is you get the propaganda
video and then you get to walk around here yeah but use of his always with us you know and he's
yeah he's asking the same he's all asking the same questions we are yeah but that you know
the angle of sun here also gives you a really good you know you can see the right sort of grid work
here and then also notice in the trench it becomes very like there's it's rough out here you see how
it's sort of all these scoops and it's sort of grid like there's the next picture might show this
better man imagine spending all that time scooping that motherfucker out of there and they get they
crack it like mother fucker well that's the other that's the weird thing right is the idea that
they were making an obelisk and it they discovered a flaw or it cracked or there was an earthquake
or whatever and they're just abandoning the entire thing abandon it not like we have to cut granite
blocks for anything else and we've already done all this work right you could you could chop this up
into a bunch of beautiful granite blocks but no they just they leave the whole thing they just
leave it there all that work so that doesn't make it doesn't make any sense if if it broke
when they were working on it they could just make it into smaller box blocks to be used for a wall
or something but they didn't yeah so it suggests that whatever work they were doing just all stopped
yeah this is and then it gets buried and then the people who were quarrying later didn't even know
it was there this correlates with the woman and white sands running yes yeah get there yeah there
you go it gets buried yeah the other thing you'll notice like i can back up and show you this here
that these lines go all the way down the trench across the bottom up the side of the obelisk probably
pretty regularly across the top down the trench up you know it's a continuous
i would love to scan the whole thing and find out is it a is it really a rough grid
does it do it this way as well all the way down you know right
that it looks pretty regular like look at it look at it down here huh see how these scoops
are going up and then they start going across the thing the same way here down somebody did
something weird right there in the top of the obelisk right here somebody messed it up yeah yeah
yeah i mean that's clearly like hand done by hand as as opposed to the rest of the grid you think so
i think they i think they machini they left the machine running when they went for a lunch and the
arm just slowly let down and yeah somebody lost their job the smoothing machine was sitting on
top of they just unplugged it and when they came back to work after lunch they plug it back in and
it starts bouncing around on there but yeah again this just shows you the regularity of the of the
lines going across the bottom of the trench and then the ones coming down the side here right right
oh and here's kyle attempting his no i'm gonna i'm making an obelisk right yeah he's building
obelisk dude look at your hair man oh yeah i just cut it off not too long ago no wonder you're so
good at playing guitar i'm growing it back but yeah you you know you do that for a little bit
you're just like no this is no this is not how they did gonna be there a while yeah
so you can't we couldn't get down in the trench next to that obelisk but there are other places
in the quarry where you can get down next into the trenches next to some really large blocks
that they were cutting out this is one of them so this is showing you scoop marks next to that
here's another good set oh wait wait wait go back there go back there yeah so that so see the edge
on the right mm-hmm would that does that look like a radius because look how perfect it is yeah that
curve yeah it could be very interesting but they're definitely working the the work is the
piece of stone to the left yeah this is this is going to be the piece of the thing they were
they were trying to remove yeah so they're like cutting in and then cutting down deep and then
cutting up underneath this thing now wait there actually could have been a piece of work to the
right broken off here like you're saying yeah they dug under and broke it off yeah could be that
yeah so he might be right well i'm just thinking like that if it's a machine that's got like a
you mean it's a radius this way yeah yeah that was the extent of the the reach yeah so he the
it's going from one side to the other and that's that part of that radius yeah that's a good point
it is a good point so this is it just looks like sand looks like a sand castle yeah it does yeah
so this is down in that next to that work on the other side and idea the width of that trench yeah
so you can again you can see that how the lines are continuous now i'm down in there
looking up at the trench walls mm-hmm this is looking underneath the work so you can see the
scoops continue up underneath the block and then go up onto the underside of the block and then
continue up it's like what was making this turn here yeah
and again it seems to happen there's like a line in the granite here
is it a curved line well i mean is like there's a natural stone the natural stone is just lighter
right in this section where they were turning right it's strange but yeah see how deep these these
scoops are you know you you're standing in them when you're walking through them it's it's very
strange mm-hmm but like ben has said this before that that if you're using pounding stones the
place where you want to use the stone is on these ridges that's where you're going to break off the
most material if you if you were actually doing it by pounding rocks against it you would hit this
part or this part because you could you have the most chance of breaking off in a large amount of
material instead of a little bit of dust yeah the point is you just would never end up you wouldn't
ridges that high that raised right right if you were just pounding away at it no not at all
i don't think but i love this you know the idea of the story is like this is this is your trench
johnson take your take your take your pounding stone this is where you work don't come over
don't work on this trench you work in this one yeah and so each guy just sits here for his entire
life entire life and digs oh my lord so that's the quarry so now now we can we can look at the
serapium real quick all the way back up next to next to geese the serapium is so fucking crazy
yeah so this is a good map of the of the interior it's the great the greater galleries is what this
is called there's a whole bunch of the complex was really big lesser galleries all over the place
but the the only part that's open right now is these the greater galleries look at how big that
thing is there's use of looks cast yeah cast concrete it does now um chris said that the
outsides of these things aren't perfect but the insides are well i mean in some cases the insides
are extremely flat like he found and he was measuring them and polished but there are there
are definitely other ones that show like non flat surfaces and they have different angles but
what's weird is that you know you have to think about this in terms of priorities so
there's the priority of the quality of the stone number one there's the there's the
geometric perfection priority and then of course um you know what what is the what is more important
is is is integrity of the stone more important or is the geometry more important right how much
time do you have to do this so in some cases to me it looks like from looking at the insides of
stones i found insides of the boxes i found places where like an entire inside bottom corner was not
finished there's just this whole piece of stone in the corner when you go to look at the outside
that same corresponding corner it's cut away so it's like was the thickness of the wall a priority
was wall thickness right a bigger priority than geometric perfection
and then of course there's plenty of these that have these big divots these scoops cut
out of them and so that brings to question like the the integrity of the stone is there a crack
you know that they said they wanted to remove yeah like look at this so so does the does the
integrity of the stone again supersede geometric perfection like they seem to not care whether
it's the inside or the outside because i got into another box that had huge bowl like scoop marks out
of the 40 yes polished polished it's like it's been scooped and polished just like this exterior is
here what and in one case like i would say so also take just pay attention to this yeah there's
a big inclusion like a crystalline inclusion so this is like you know a vein of other material in
here right yeah one of them the say the wall this this narrow wall of the box on the inside the
whole thing was like slanted towards you like the wall was like this i have no idea why i mean it's
just it's that's what i'm saying it's like it's not it's not simple enough to say the interiors
of the boxes are perfect and they didn't care about the exterior because some of the exteriors
of the boxes are magnificent also but and some of the interiors are very very you know made to a
degree of precision and vice versa it seems like what they were going for was especially on the
interior a kind of perfection like you know these these beautiful 90 degree angles right here that
the lid needed to fit flat or whatever but that there was something else that superseded that
in importance like the integrity of the box or the thickness of the stone that took priority that
they would compromise the perfection of the interior surfaces if they had to so like what
kyle was talking about is there's a box where the entire bottom of the outside the bottom corner
is just cut away for some reason it's gone so it's flattened down here so the interior surface of
the box also has a bevel that matches this cut away so it maintained the right same amount of
thickness yes yeah yeah or they add they just they just left enough stone on the inside to to make up
for yeah some of that it just here's another one with a bunch of scoops taken out of the outside
you know it's just no what is your guys theory on what the purpose of these boxes was
i like destroying theories about the purpose of the box our favorite our favorite thing is to
ask people to send us their theories and we destroyed it i was trying i was trying to pry this
out of chris and he it was it was like pulling teeth the thing that okay i think they make a really
good hermetic seal if you if you have enough precision on the lid and the box itself they
would basically be they would ring together yeah it's it's a way of it's some kind of adhesion
that happens like a molecular flat yeah surfaces that touch each other they can they can't pull
them apart you could slide them against each other but you can't actually pull them apart they make
these um these sets of blocks to use to measure precision um they're they're precision measuring
tools yeah that you can take different thicknesses of block well you know you'd need a certain
length so you grab a couple of different blocks you ring them together you can't pull them apart
right so if you you can imagine a fine precise flat surface on the lid and the box and you slide
those lids together then you may have a hermetic seal so that you could contain something for a
long period of time without it oxidizing or you know whatever being destroyed they also they so it's
like they also act as a kind of a technological gate or a safe yeah yeah right like there's it's
so heavy and so massive and in such a tight enclosure that without some kind of technology like
you know rope cap stand wheels the idea of the lever and pulley you're not going to be able to
open them so you could effectively lock away something in these boxes from anybody that's not
primitive not not advanced enough to open the box and that I love the idea that because you know
all these boxes were empty when they were founded modern times right I love the idea that they used
to have something in them and whoever came and opened all but one of these boxes knew the contents
they knew what was in them because they left one box unopened and it had nothing in it it was
blown open in modern times and it was also empty so if you well how do we know that they
whoever blew it opened didn't find what was like was that marietta did that
I think we couldn't we couldn't figure that out was it vise or marietta I thought it was vise
it could have been vise yeah he liked he liked Howard vise like gunpowder on stuff yeah yeah some
of the corners of these block vise yeah I'm just I'm just telling you what is in the record that
that box was blown open and it was empty okay and he would have loved to have found right like the
apis bull or something in there right right so it's just if if this was a vault that contained
for example documents or you know some kind of knowledge that and that's what I'm saying I just
love this idea that somebody that had the knowledge of where they were and what contents were in the
boxes would have come open them up remove the contents and never touch the one that was empty
yeah yeah leave box number 13 alone it's empty but open all the rest of them and get the contents
out of it yeah and they're all open they're all open to just a certain amount just like this like
if you were a bank robber and you went to rob all this all the safety deposit boxes and you had
information on which ones had stuff in them you would only open those yeah so that's that's what
I'm suggesting here hmm they're not marked are they some of them have writing on them one or two
now when I asked Chris about this he said he you know he was very careful about giving just
random theories about what he thinks they could be without evidence yeah um you know because he
you know he writes books and yeah he wants to be taken seriously he doesn't want people to take
you know clip when I hit something he said out of context and say this guy's a crackpot
which is fine but when I was asking him I was like really trying to drill down like what he
thinks they were he goes he said I need to read the book called engines of creation to understand
what they were have you heard of that book nope but I did listen to that show it's why I need to
read that book also yeah I remember him saying that now that you mentioned it and he was saying
there's a theory like a some kind of battery well yeah so something about like crystals were
grown in there something was oh yeah you could do that that's cool you could grow yeah yeah so you
grow a giant crystal in there and then we get the crystals out and then crystals turn into laser
beams which cut the stones you know what I'm saying I'm like yeah then what and then we put the lid
back on put the crystals in the pyramid so they vibrate yeah yeah yeah I don't know I just there's
a lot of missing stuff too this is the other thing about going through these sites in Egypt is
that like Kyle was saying earlier thousands of years of people have been going in and out of
these places right taking things breaking stuff removing stuff stealing stuff adding things putting
candles in you know setting fires on things right we're shipping worshipping stuff worshipping
things letting camels live in there and goats and and then of course there's all the environmental
stuff wind and sand and precipitation and just time and so every one of these vaults that had a
box in it also had two granite slabs to either side of each box that had false doors carved into
them there's a couple they're left but most of them are all gone so either so then you start to see a
picture of like okay there's a box it's in its own particular alcove into either side are granite
slabs facing it with these false doors cut into it and you know so what does that mean does that
does that make it some kind of resonance chamber you know I don't know I find it hard to believe
because you know this this box doesn't want to move it really badly wants to stay still yeah
this is not I mean but you know the sound waves inside they like to be sustained I mean they're
echoing bouncing back and forth across the wall so you go in there and when you hit the
you know the fundamental frequency of like say the width of the box it's it's just amazing yeah
yeah you know it's incredible and then you can find the one that's the height and the the width
to the height is they're slightly off so they're a little dissonant and if you can kind of get
them both they they put this third bead in there it's just wild it's it's yeah and then the length
of the box is is pretty deep and really hard to reach with my hard to be a deep voice to be able
to get the length frequency but yeah that I mean but you know I it's hard to imagine that okay let
me get down in there and you slide the box closed so that I can resonate the box and you know reach
enlightenment yeah you're gonna let me out right yeah I don't know dude I don't know about that
as a purpose oh man it's just that to me seems to be just a that's just a result of whatever the
actual function was because the function resulted in these geometric proportions that make it make
the the sound resonance inside amazing this is a good example of the like they're aiming for this
kind of perfection like look at this edge the edge is like a razor I mean it is perfect this
prism shape that they're going for it whoops right is uh is awesome but then they for some reason have
scooped material off the front edge here and then and then polished it right yeah these the
scoops are all polished too and you know it's hard to see the polish because of the dust yeah but I
mean it is like it's like a mirror there's a giant scoop taken out of that one yeah that one looks
crazy so it's it and then you see they smoothed it and polished it right so they're they're they're
very concerned with removing for whatever reason whatever was contained in this part of the material
but then they carefully polish the remnant there are certain inclusions I mean you can see this in
in the quarry not that's the quarry where these came from I don't think anybody knows where the
quarry where these came from oh really um but that's one kind of diorite dark there will be spots in
the wall where you can just see like a completely different type of rock yeah just stuck like a
chunk so I'm wondering if maybe some of the scoops were just like let's get that different type of
stone out yeah oh yeah you can see on this one something they cut the entire back corner off of
the they've cut this whole bevel off there and then on this one they've done it to the front side
they've completely chopped the entire front edge right off of there for some reason and then
polished it right you can see how shiny it is right well you said it was also really important
that they didn't want cracks in there to remain it remaining keep the integrity of them yeah so if
there were cracks they wanted to scoop them out that's a question like is is that what they that
doing that is incredible yeah how big that is yeah you can walk underneath so we're all standing on
a floor a wooden floor that's been built this raised up above the floor the block is sit the
box is sitting on and yet you can still walk beneath the lid standing up straight so it's the
boxes are enormous unbelievable man you gotta have them and that that lid was moved how
we don't know yeah who opened them they were opened in antiquity so nobody really knows i
i don't know who opened them and they're all like i said if you look if you've paid attention
they're all just slid open a little bit right just enough to get inside in some cases i'm not sure
you could actually get in that you can get in most of them really well yeah i mean it's like
three feet yeah off this end yeah there's an opening in the back okay i see for sure yeah
because you can see how far and how would you even move that top part like today if you wanted
to move it how the fuck would you do that in that tiny little space yeah you could use hydraulic
jacks hydraulics yeah up against the walls yeah i mean this is bedrock walls i mean you can put
a lot of force against those walls you know frame it out with something wrap it in cable and get a
you know some winches and i have no idea pushing it pushing it would be easier than pulling on it
yeah which is interesting because a lot of them are pushed their lids are shifted towards the
the the central walkway from the back which is suggests you put something they put something
against the wall yeah yeah right uh here's kyle sent this kind of gives you the scale right that's
kyle standing on the upper edge of one one of this is a this is a box made of the the rose granite
so it's different than the rest of them yeah that's one yeah and it has no lid the lid is in the
hallway it's it's gigantic and it has losses it has the nubs on it yeah there he is down
down inside the is he praying interior it's this is completely legal science
totally legal is he praying i was praying praying to the box god
please tell me what these were for the inside of that thing doesn't look smooth
yeah this one isn't finished in the same way that the rest of them are right you can see on
the outside here it's it's you know i mean it's beautiful still but it isn't polished like you
know this just kind of shows you the other thing is that you know they're the question about how
did they get them in there you know they they weigh a lot and they're enormous and then you know
there's no like dropping the boxes in and then building the roof because this is all cut into
the bedrock these are these are tunnels that were just basically drilled through the bedrock right
right right so they had to maneuver them through these long hallways and they were almost as wide
as the hallways themselves yeah like this one holy what the shit what so this one this is magic
this is another it's gotta be magic this is another you know point of the the whole unfinished
concept like they didn't finish the job they were in the middle of transporting boxes to
their places in their alcoves and they didn't quite get it done most of the boxes are in place
they're polished they're finished out but this one is rough cut it isn't polished and it hasn't been
completely moved into place yet and its lid is also sitting it's lid is laying in the hallway
to near the entrance it looks like if the lid was on it it almost wouldn't fit right that's
it does seem like there's two ways to look at this like that maybe why they're moving this one
without the lid that also might be why the lids have bevels those angles oh yeah yeah yeah
i don't know why you would want to move them together that makes it harder yeah move them separately
man this is the biggest fucking mystery it so here's it this is showing you the scale and again
remember that he's standing on a raised platform the box is sitting on the original floor yeah
like six or seven inches down and they built the floor around the fuck but it's still taller than
he is you know you have to look up to see the edge of the box if you if you need to get past this
to get to the other boxes and you open up those other boxes it gets shit out how do you get it
passed there are two ways out there are more than actually i think there are probably three ways
out and maybe possibly more i haven't we haven't there are some places down here that are still
just closed off and some collapsed oh i can go back to the the map here oh okay this is the
this is the box that we're looking at in the hallway this is its lid
so this is the like this is the you know all the beautiful like we showed you a bunch of pictures
of these guys in these and look how they're kind of you know staggered none of them are
like exactly facing each other it's really interesting this whole thing looks like a
key right so you got this box and then and then there's a space that space is opposite this other
box so there's always a wall facing the alcove like if you needed to mount machinery to work on
this box and get it in place you have a place to mount it right here you know push it or push again
push it to get it in there and then each alcove is a deep hole right so you're walking in these
hallways and then where the boxes are lower they're set down lower to the point to where the lids are
almost at foot level like so that you know you can kind of just slide the lid in on top of the box
it's interesting how it's set up like that so yeah this is what we were looking at let me go back to
where we were thanks Gregor for the yeah we really appreciate it this is incredible i've never seen
any kind of map of this like that really puts it into perspectives great and yeah you can see
how this box is you know it's a little wonky like they haven't they haven't wavy they've made it you
know it you know it's going to be a box it's hollowed out and it's got a lid but they haven't
you know flattened it and polished it like and that's this also implies that they did all that
onsite onsite in its place they weren't doing it on the surface and then moving them down in which
is another interesting implication about precision because we were talking about you know the the
precision flat plates that they make out of granite they're in climate controlled places
because if you let them if you let the temperature change or humidity change or whatever it will shift
around the granite the shape and size of it can change yeah so if you want to make a hermetic
seal like kyle was talking about you have to do all the finishing work down in the tunnels
so here's a quick look at the writing on one of the boxes right and this i know you've talked
to ben about this how it's very rough uh you can see they couldn't even really make the line straight
and there's you know there's a big interesting this is a big scooped out piece they've moved a
bunch of material here and polished it and the people who are making these marks are just cutting
through the polish right hammering through hammering through it yeah yeah it just looks
like toddlers came through afterwards with crayons yeah and you can see that in some cases they
couldn't even finish they couldn't make the lines connect you know you sort of get this idea that
like the guy is working along and then the dark in the dark and then he gets tired and then it's
the end of the day and he's just like fuck and he goes home comes back the next day and it's a
little better you know yep yep he's wearing candles on his head dude trying to hammer and
chisel that oh god yeah this is amazing man so just to show you a few more things around the world
this is oyante tombo in peru so look at the you know megalithic same thing yeah you see the same
you see the you see the nubs you see the scoops you see the striations you see the the are those
the drill marks the the vertical strips yeah those those not drills it's flat no i mean that like
that the vertical like in between oh these yeah these are like inserts between each one and they
have a little nub on each one at the bottom so those little things those are separate from the
other stones yeah those are also stones yeah they're little flat inserts in between each giant block
yeah this is also at oyante tombo giant blocks big nubs you know it's just beautiful stuff
this is cool uh a kind of this wall is almost complete but notice how
that the nubs show up around this opening doorway the blocks all get way bigger
and then the nubs are all around here like this is why it seems like this is indicating something
about construction and you can see us a little bit of symmetry in the blocks on either side of that
door yeah it's cool and then notice you know that just how these giant blocks are sort of strewn
around the landscape up here right so this is another thing that you see in peru is like
evidence of some kind of enormous destruction to some of these sites now luke was mentioning
something about some of these sites in peru and how they were built to be earthquake proof
yeah this kind of they call this uh one one term for this type of stonework is cyclopean
you know like it's uh made by giants basically but yes it basically means that the idea of
cyclopean stonework is it's they're non-homogeneous you know every every blocker's piece of stone
is a different shape and size they're dry laid which means there's no mortar
mm-hmm right and then so that means that if you have an earthquake each individual stone
could sort of move around on its own and they'll go back together and then they'll just kind of
go back together whereas when we make a wall out of bricks and mortar number one you have multiple
fracture points that are very that go all the way down the wall right and then also we've glued
them together so instead of each brick being able to vibrate the whole wall starts shaking and then
it splits and falls apart right these are able to withstand earthquakes a lot better but these
are actually no straight fracture lines here i mean you can't you know even with a brick wall
you can get you get these little stair step cracks yeah go run all the way down the wall right you
won't there's no way to do that with these what's also amazing is these are retaining walls these
are terraces holding up the mountain side so it's you know so you know retaining walls yeah
retaining walls there what is it there's two kinds of retaining walls those that have failed
those that have failed and those that will fail all right those that are about to yeah but these
are amazing to have withstood this all that weight of that dirt for so long and still be so
beautifully now those little tiny rock walls onto the side and like on the top that's yes
yeah on the top edge is that same guys same exact same guys dudes yeah the next day
they were like you know what this this other style of construction is dumb yeah we got to
do it this way this looks this looks cooler no i'm i'm obviously right this is the idea of the you
know the three that that there's this sort of theory of i can't remember all the terms but it's
hanan pacha and uh buddhan pacha buddhan yeah there's three different terms but basically is
talking about three civilizations in peru the oldest one seems to have been people who came
along and did rock cut work which is where you don't make blocks you just you just take you cut
something out of the mountain side and leave a temple or a shape right this is called rock cut
instead of uh stacked construction then you have the cyclopean style megalithic work
which is also it's like it's it's still beautiful and it's but it's completely different from the
or what the the rock cut stuff and then you have this uh where's my pointer right here
then you have this stuff right so this is inka and then this is someone mysterious and then
there's hanan pacha which is even older somebody else mysterious and they kind of surround each
other like notice how the this repair or inka work is at the tops of these walls you see it here too
yep and here right so this wall is ancient and the ink could come along and sort of repair it with
their own style of stonework but in some places you'll find the very ancient rock cut stuff and
this stuff is repairing it or enclosing it and protecting it and then the inka stuff is on top
of that so you have three different stages hmm here's uh saxo waman so you again you see all
the same marks scoots right it's the same yeah it's the same man yeah even the way they bevel
the edges towards the you know to where the join is yeah it's it's just like the osirian yep i wonder
if they were planning to go back and flatten this yeah can you imagine being the inka guy that
gets this job you better make it look good johnson oh this is going to stand there against the you
know this work rock work for all of eternity well where where did this block go dude this is
this is incredible this is here's another one unbelievable this is a this one this stone is
kind of famous it has yep yeah but you again you see the divots the scoops the you know the the
nature of the stonework and then the inka stuff up at the tops sort of repairing things now are these
photos that you took no i haven't we haven't been to peru yet i can't wait to go the egypt photos
were yeah egypt photos are all from from our trips yeah okay yeah there's a you know now we're
looking at the moa we were looking at these earlier but this so this is another east rylan
yeah he's in the quarry right so he's unfinished they haven't completely dug him out of the rock yet
this this would and the other thing that's interesting about this is this would have been
the largest one ever made if it had been completed just like the obelisk but it's still in the quarry
then you got ball back this is in lebanon we were going to go see this but you know circumstance
has changed oh god so this is uh this is the quarry for ball back and what's fun is this for a long
time this was this block right here was considered the largest block ever cut by by mankind you know
it's an estimated 1200 tons something like that it's completely removed from the bedrock that's
bigger than the one in at aswan yeah that well the aswan is it is estimated but it's still connected
this one's not connected this one's never yeah this one's completely dug out it was this is called
the stone of the south or the stone of the pregnant woman it's famous from the quarry but then some
german archaeologists went in to start digging down around it because it was buried like the the
the dirt line was like here okay so they started digging around and they found out that it's sitting
on top of two even larger blocks oh my god these are estimated between 16 to 1800 tons
yeah so the story was that they they cut this this top block out and they were like oh it's too big
we'll just leave it here again it's like instead of cutting it into smaller blocks and moving it
that you know there's like put it down no they just it was too big and yet when they dig down
they find out they actually stacked it on top of other blocks so no it wasn't too big this gives
you the scale that is wild yeah it just goes to show that the historians don't really know
no fucking clue what was going on yeah yeah and why didn't so it's obviously they just never
finished the job wouldn't it be great if we could actually like discover what this was all
how this was done and what it was done who was done by in our lifetimes that would be great
yeah i mean the standard story will tell you this is the romans that did this
we know the romans could move some very heavy stones and they built some amazing stuff but
they didn't ever move anything like this you know and the idea that and they did build a temple
on the ballback platform i don't have pictures of this right now right right but uh but the the
trilithon which is the collection of three of these giant blocks they're not quite as big as this one
but there's three of them and they're stacked up and you know 30 meters high it's it's a big wall
is a sort of a separate construction from the entire platform that the that the temple of jupiter
is built on there at the at the ball deck platform right and the temple of jupiter is on a part of
the platform it's got this big pedestal and the temple doesn't isn't quite big enough to fit
on the pedestal that the and it's so it's like it's like the romans found this platform
is very ancient they honored it by building a temple of jupiter there but they couldn't make the
roof span all the way across the this part of the pedestal so it doesn't quite fit it's too small
yeah it's like that stuff the stuff on the bottom was there way earlier yeah the platform was already
there the platform right it's like in japan they have these giant megalithic stone platforms that
for you know the emperors have been building their palaces on for a long time right but the
platforms are megalithic stone constructions that go down into water and they have survived thousands
of years of earthquakes it makes you wonder like how much stuff like this is there underneath the
ocean oh man because what is what does the ocean cover it covers like more than 70 percent of the
surface of the earth yeah 76 percent something like that yeah yeah but i mean the joke is the
continental shelves you can see on the maps like the continental shelves that go way out
in many cases they would have been above sea level yeah before the end you know before mel wat pulse
went a yeah yeah yeah so it's it's interesting with you know with all this stuff and then ben's
ben and chris dunn's work with the vases uh and then the stuff with the the comet research group
in the younger driest that the evidence for some advanced civilization in extremely remote
prehistory that was able to do some of these large megalithic anomalous projects all over the world
and they just almost completely vanished because we know there was a massive destruction
extinction event and flooding event and with the yeah with the end of the with the younger driest
period do you think some of them are still here yeah i do where are they underground and under the
water they're living under the ocean yes and under the ground yeah i do have you heard of a project
looking glass no it sounds familiar what what remind me it was uh i think it was in the 60s or 70s
it was a project done by cia and the air force i heard it maybe the army and it was one of those
like psychokinetic programs they were doing or they were working on during the cold war
and they built they built some sort of a device for remote viewers to go into and in this device
they built at s4 they could look actually remote view into the past and into the future and there
was a guy i can't remember his name right now but he went into the device and he basically saw like a
cataclysm that wiped out the human race and the survivors went underground and built like
underground cities and catacombs and over thousands tens of thousands of years
humans evolved in this weird way because there was no sunlight they human beings
evolved into what looks like these gray aliens because there's no light their eyes got big
their bodies became really skinny and it's a theory now that those gray aliens are like
coming back in time to like visit us and like make sure that we go down the right right path
to result in them exactly exactly to protect to make sure to ensure their survival in the future
love that one that is yeah it just seems like i don't want to completely pick that
skirt now but that's a good one yeah if you're already there in the future and you're there it
seems like anything you do going back into the past is only going to mess it up exactly right
so unless there's some other force trying to change it that you're fighting against all you're
going to do if you go back in the past is going to to actually change the future which is what
you're already in i don't know but the idea which is why the ufos are trying to stay they're not
trying to stay away from us they're trying to observe us right this the zoo hypothesis right
i don't know why do they keep why do they keep starting cults you don't even need the time trap
right really you could just you just have this continuous civilization passing down
knowledge and they've they've been doing this for who knows how long and if they were living
underground turning into the grays or whatever they could still be flying around in crazy ufos
but they're not necessarily time traveling i'm saying you could remove the time travel
aspect from that and still have it work right that they're just involved in things that are
going on today but they're not widely known yeah no yeah you could and they maintain their
technology for who knows how long well i mean i do think that something that you know i think of
this uh like sort of like the third party hypothesis that something has been
sort of injecting information or very slightly interfering with human development for a long
time like paleo contact you know i don't know if it's aliens or if it's a future version of ourselves
or if they're if it's something even stranger i don't know it could it could just be a parallel
track of of human development that went underground or underwater a long time ago and
they're just us but they're they're they treat us like uncontacted tribes right right you know
like a breakaway civilization but we're talking about they broke away 20 000 years ago and they
just don't want to have anything to do with us except then they see we start blowing up nukes
and they're like whoa whoa whoa right right this is our planet too then they start showing up and
like yeah we're from i don't know venus whatever stop blowing up nukes they don't want us to know
that they actually live here you know and then you you get this idea of of
like how often in ancient texts when they're writing about visions or religious experiences
is it is it really an encounter with this other this third party you know yeah and and maybe some
of it is like i don't know project blue beam style where they're just making a projection
here's the angel and it's covered in light and it descends from the sky it isn't you know a person
it's a hologram or what is project blue beam the project blue beam ideas that that that somebody
would have the technology to sort of make a lot of people believe that an alien event had happened
or the second coming of jesus or whatever you know it's like a a mass sigh op you know like
that would be visible to everybody in the sky you know some kind of giant hologram oh like
3d holograms yeah kind of like maybe what happened with joseph smith right he saw something like that
some angel came down and told him a message you know in his bedroom or whatever told him about
the tablets and it was like connected to a beam of light or something yeah i mean bramley wrote
about this you know the gods of eden book was this was his idea he was like i was looking
in history for who like what are the reasons for all the conflicts and wars you know like who
like there's this idea of there maybe there's this secretive cabal of people who have been
profiting off of wars and causing them for a long time like some kind of secret brotherhood
you know that's been doing this for a long time but the farther back he went he was just like well
wait a minute when you go far enough back it looks like they were gods and the the text talk
about them coming down from the sky so he connects it to aliens and ufos but it's just as likely i think
that that it could be something from here and all you have to do is sort of fly over to the
less advanced people and descend from the sky and they'll think you're a god yeah you don't have to
be from space yeah to do that um one of the weirdest things to me about the whole anunnaki
story is how they seemed like very similar to us in a way that they would start wars or be fighting
over things yeah breed with us and i wouldn't yeah i whenever i think of like super advanced
beings i i feel like they would evolve past that like these these deep primordial
instincts of like fighting and being territorial and that kind of stuff and if you're like this
crazy enlightened god why the fuck would you be going like starting wars it was you would think
that they would have a better way of doing things yeah i mean maybe it was just a game to them yeah
maybe you know it's like you like you get to like ant hills and you make sure that they start fighting
each other just just to watch you know we call it hurling humans like you go all the way back in
time and you see like these gods were gathering large groups of humans around them and they would
throw them at each other like my humans are going to attack your humans right oh yeah who has the
best army i've got the best humans yeah my humans are going to kick your humans asses right right
yeah and this guy that guy who i had just had on here was taught telling me explaining to me all
about how apparently according to these texts that we were created and our lifespans were
dramatically shortened and people were living like tens of thousands of years before us and then all
of a sudden we only get to live 120,000 years and you blew my mind last night when you're talking
about how it's in the bible that that's actually in the bible in genesis yeah yeah these days will
be 120 years or something like that yeah it's right after the flood that god basically decrees
that man will live no more than 120 years and before that the the anti-diluvian patriarchs of
the bible were you know it's 600 years old 900 years old 800 years old Noah was old you know
Noah was like 600 when the flood happened something like that Methuselah is you know
famously the most i think he lived to almost a thousand years before he died you know but they
were all they they've lived a very long time and then after the flood no one lives that long anymore
and it's like this decree and there's a similar story with the tower of babel where it's like
god is looking down at the people building the tower first the people are like they they have
survived the flood yeah it's been maybe 600 years or something like that so these people are aware
that the world was destroyed in the past and they're like hey let's let's come together and
we'll build this tower so they have this goal of building a tower to the heavens and being all of
one language so that they won't be scattered throughout the earth again because they witnessed
that you know their ancestors had witnessed it with the flood and then it switches to the god
narrative and he's looking down and seeing that they're building the tower and he's like because
they're all of one language nothing that they set their minds to do will they not be able to achieve
in other words they'll be able to do anything they want so we must go down there destroy the
tower and scatter them and confuse their language so that they will be scattered and it looks like
confuse their tongue so they can't work together yeah it looks like another set of attempts to
prevent us because the the follow-up is otherwise they will become like us yeah is what he says
so it's like so if you're thinking of venting to from becoming like the powerful so if you're
going with you know if you're going with the like the pure religion and like is this this is
supposed to be the creator of the entire universe and he's worried that humans are going to become
him or is this something else this is a story about something else you know yeah because the
the traditional interpretation is that man's hubris makes him believe that he can be like god
right and that's that's true like we we can be arrogant and that is a flaw but the another way
to look at when you just think of the narrative that that that there is some other group of beings
out there that are concerned about us becoming as powerful as they are yeah and when we look like
we're getting to that point they put a stop to it so yeah tower of battle they uh the gods didn't
want us to unite and become them yeah so they made us they spread us out made us have different
language so we were became territorial apes it's a similar story with adam and eve like they they
eat of the fruit of the knowledge right the tree of knowledge and then god is like talk that goes to
the narrative his narrative he's talking to whoever's with him his committee he's like if they then
also eat of the fruit of the tree of life they will become like us if they have knowledge and life
so it's like the same yeah the same deal so it's it's weird well guys thank you so much for doing
