This is my second show at Janice Law, last year I did one with Kodak Black, this year
is my show, me and my homeboy show, me and my other homeboy show, so growing up every
year, you know, so growing up, that's time to pass by.
It's Willman, tell him what he call it, tell him what he call you Willman, he jumping
in the music.
I done did it all, chasers and all, stun-outs and all, you feel me, I get it anything, just
go dumb.
You want me to go hop in the truck right now and go dumb?
Go to the show right now, Janice Law, man, just pull up, hop out, man, hop out, man.
I deserve life behind bars, but look at me, mama, I know that you don't you lost me,
I graduated, still can't use a thing, that they taught me, still bought me, no brand new
beam, I ride that bitch, if I was sitting on my way to the cleaners, time to get clean,
I knew that I never had shit, pull up that bitch with the meaner, been on eating in his
room, be meaningful of this to see, black sheep, but a family, but juicy, we on TV, no time
for these bitches, I'm chasing that fatter cheese, mama say that when I say that, I add
legally, teachers used to say things that make me feel illiterate, let me eat for you,
the day that my name's worth millions, I'm not like these rappers, baby, I'm way much
different, cause I know that these days, they say fake, and I'm livin' you, baby, have
your baby see a part of me that's innocent, they locked down in my cell, I still remember
it, though I try to forget this shit, I try to forget this shit, on the road to riches,
I'm trying to get it by hearing me, I'm on road to riches, if you can see, I'm on
road to riches, I'm trying to get away from the streets, I'm on road to riches, I'm on
road to riches, and if you get in my way, I won't hesitate to eliminate, I'll eliminate
if you get in the way, please don't get in the way, please don't get in the way, I won't
eliminate
