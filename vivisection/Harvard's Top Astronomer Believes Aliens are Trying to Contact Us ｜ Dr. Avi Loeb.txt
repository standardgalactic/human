Hello world! Today my guest is Professor Avi Loeb. Avi is an astrophysicist at
Harvard and his new book, Extraterrestrial, the first signs of
intelligent life beyond Earth, proposes that an interstellar object that passed
through our solar system in 2017 may have been the creation of alien
intelligence. This man is truly a genius who is pushing the envelope in the world
of astrophysics and cosmology. I hope you guys enjoy this one as much as I did.
Please welcome Avi Loeb.
Pleasure to meet you. Avi, is that how you pronounce it?
Yes.
So again, I just asked you before we started recording, have you done any of these zoom
conversations in the past?
Well, thanks for having me. Yeah, over the past three weeks or so, things were very
hectic. I've had about 150 zoom meetings of this type, interviews with either
podcasters or television or newspaper or radio stations and there seemed to be an
enormous interest in the book. And I think part of the reason is that the
scientific community starved the public on this topic of the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence, technological signatures, for many
decades and the public is thirsty for information. And I address this interest
and then it's intriguing to the public. And hopefully the scientific community
will start discussing this topic within the mainstream in the future. That's my
hope.
That's incredible. You know, it's funny that we reached out to you probably
maybe three weeks ago, we scheduled this interview. And then late last week, I
saw you pop up on Joe Rogan's podcast. Right. So did all of this sort of like
spiral out of control after you went and visited him?
Well, it started before that. There was a report in the New York Post that I
did not anticipate that started lit this fire of interest. And just to give you
another example over the past couple of weeks, I had about 10 filmmakers and
producers from Hollywood contact me about the book with interest of perhaps
using it for a documentary series or perhaps a film. And it's just
extraordinary, the response that I'm getting. And as you know, the book that
came out just a few days ago is already, I mean, it has been bestseller on
Amazon for a couple of weeks before it came out, even before reviews came out.
But now that there are a number of reviews of the book already on in the
New York Times, in the Washington Post, in the New Yorker, also overseas in many
outlets. And I get a lot of requests more than I can accommodate. Basically, my
day is full of interviews from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m. every day. And that will
continue for the next few weeks based on all the commitments that I've made. But
I think, you know, for me, as far as I see it, it's a platform to explain the
importance of the issues that I'm trying to bring up to the attention of the
public and the science community, more than a privilege of, you know, raising my
status in any way. So I see it as an opportunity to communicate. And I'll be
glad to discuss with you the various issues that appear in my book. Maybe I'll
just say up front that there are two major aspects of the book. One has to do
with the object that was discovered in 2017 that is very weird and doesn't look
like anything we've seen before from within the solar system. The object came
from outside the solar system. And so I suggested that maybe it's artificial in
origin, not natural. And then the second part of the book is discussing, you know,
the implications that it could have to us as the human species and why there is
reluctance to consider that possibility that I just mentioned. And are we ready
to receive the news? So the first time I heard about you was when I think VICE
released an article about the Amua Mua, the long cigar shaped shiny object that
was traveling through our solar system. Could you start out by explaining exactly
what was this Amua Mua that was traveling through our solar system?
Well, first, also, I should say that I had many years in which I worked on other
topics of, for example, how did the first stars form the universe, the first
light, which is mentioned actually in the first chapter of the Old Testament,
the Bible. How was the first light generated in the early universe? And we
can now address it with scientific means. And I also worked on black holes for
many years. And the topic of the search for life or intelligent life in
particular came to my attention only over the past few years. And I'm actually
in addition to the popular level book, we're about to publish with a former
postdoc of mine, a textbook of 1000 pages long, that will be published in June
2021, that will include the foundation for future research on this subject. And
so I see it as the most exciting frontier that will that should occupy
center stage within the mainstream of astronomy in the future. Unfortunately,
right now it's pushed to be the periphery. And we can talk about that. So
let me come back to your question. And that is Oumuamua. This object was
spotted in October 2017 by the Pan stars observatory in Hawaii, which was
tasked to look for objects that may come close to earth because they couldn't
danger us. Congress gave this task to NASA to find 90% of all the objects that
are larger than 140 meters that get close to earth so that we can protect
ourselves by deflecting them if they are too dangerous. You know that the
dinosaurs died as a result of a big rock. And they didn't have astronomers to
warn them. That's that's the point. So we have telescopes we can tell in advance
if an object is approaching us and devise methods to prevent that from
happening. So at any event the Pan star started this process of identifying
objects and in the process of serving the sky found Oumuamua, which is the very
first object that we spotted near the earth that came from outside the solar
system. And you could tell that based on the fact that it moved too fast to be
bound by the sun. So it suddenly came from outside and it was given the name
Oumuamua because it means in the Hawaiian language a scout or a messenger from
far away. The astronomers at first of course assumed that it's just like all
the rocks that we identified in the solar system. So it probably is a comet
because most of the objects are a rock covered with ice. They reside in the
outer parts of the solar system and the same kind of objects may exist near other
stars and get ejected from those environments and reach us. But the
problem was that there was no cometary tail. We couldn't see any gas trailing
the object. Visually we couldn't see it but also the space telescope looked for
any traces of carbon-based molecules couldn't see it. So it was clearly not a
comet but yet at the same time it exhibited an extra push away from the
sun that is often associated with evaporation of gas from a comet. But
since it wasn't the comet the question was what gives it this extra push? And I
suggested that it may be the reflection of sunlight. And for that purpose the
object had to be quite thin and not naturally produced. It has to be
something like a sail that you find on a boat which in the case of a boat
reflects the wind. But in the case of the sun we're talking about a sail that
reflects light and can be pushed. This is called a light sail and it's a
technology that we are currently developing for propulsion of spacecrafts
in space. And the advantage is that the spacecraft doesn't need to carry its
fuel it's just being pushed by light. I should say there was another object
identified in September 2020 just a few months ago that exhibited also an extra
push away from the sun and in addition to the sun's gravitational force and
didn't show any cometary tail. Turns out that this one was a rocket booster from
1966. Lunar Lander Surveyor II mission that was launched by NASA and it was
simply hollow and thin and that's why it was pushed by reflecting sunlight. So we
know in that case that the object was artificial in origin because we produced
it. In the case of Umuamua we don't know who produced it. And the other thing I
should say is that from the reflected light that Umuamua showed as it was
tumbling over eight hours roughly the size of a football field from the
amount of reflected sunlight we could tell that it's most likely flat not
cigar shape and also that it's very extreme in terms of its geometry. It's
much longer than it is wide when projected on the sky and that fits the
bill in terms of it potentially being a thin surface. So have you seen on a lot
of the articles online have you seen some of the renderings that they've
created of it? Oh yeah so the most popular rendering is that of a cigar shaped
object and that is based on the evidence we have and the most likely
shape is disc shape or pancake shape. Interesting and how far away is it from
the earth? Oh right now it's beyond the the distance of Jupiter and so it's
actually right now a million times fainter than when it was close to the
Sun because it dims very rapidly such an object because the amount of sunlight in
impinging on its surface drops inversely with distance squared and then the
amount of light we see reflected from it drops by another factor of one of a
distance squared. So altogether the the object dims as inversely with distance
to the fourth power which is very quickly. So by now we can't really see it
anymore and therefore we cannot even design a mission that will chase it but
we can search for other objects. You know when I go to the kitchen and I find
an ant by looking at a small portion of the kitchen I know that there should be
many more ants out there and so the conclusion from finding this object is
that there should be many more. If we use the Panstas telescope within a few years
we should find another one but in fact in three years there would be a new
survey telescope called the Vera Rubin Observatory that could then that would
be much more sensitive and therefore could find such an object every month or so.
Right now the the telescope that found this Amua-Mua what what is the I guess the
goal of that telescope is it just like generally blanketing the sky or is it
particularly looking for doomsday asteroids. Yeah so the latter it was
intended to find those near-earth objects called NEOs but then it just started the
job of doing that and the Vera Rubin Observatory would then go two-thirds of
the way towards having a full census. Congress tasked NASA to find 90% but
with the Vera Rubin Observatory we'll find maybe 60% of all near-earth objects
above 140 meters in size. How how much do astronomers your colleagues or yourself
how much of your time and focus goes towards worrying about giant earth killer
asteroids. Very little. There is a relatively small community of astronomers
that focus on on the objects within the solar system and then out of that community
a small fraction worries about near-earth asteroids so it's mainly an observational
effort to identify individual objects that may come close to earth because we can
forecast their orbits using the law of gravity and so it's sort of a practical
matter to monitor and figure out which objects might come close monitor the sky
and you know we can see objects based on their reflected sunlight so the bigger the object is
the easier it is for us to identify it at a greater distance and it also depends of course on the
telescope size and the amount of light that you can collect within the telescope diameter.
Now if there was an object that was similar to the one that took out the dinosaurs
that hit the Yucatan would how soon were we able to find it and would is there anything we could
possibly do to alter its course. Yeah so the dinosaurs were went extinct and in fact three
quarters of the earth's life forms were killed in that in that event. I mean there was this giant
rock that collided with earth it was roughly the length of Manhattan island tens of kilometers and
and then as it approached the earth probably it was a beautiful site but the fun of the
dinosaurs stopped when it collided with earth and caused this huge environmental damage the
chick salab crater and sort of a change in the in the climate of the earth because of all the dust
that was raised and and but perhaps we owe our existence to that impact because it changed
altogether the life forms that appeared on the surface of the earth and then such a big
object can be identified far enough for us to you know plan years in advance what to do
and there are various ideas about how to deflect it you can for example paint a side of it in a
color such that it will reflect or will will evaporate more quickly and then there will be some
push on it and that will deflect it from colliding with the earth you can detonate something on the
surface of such an object and that would also push it aside you can shine a laser beam on one
side of the object and do and achieve the same goal there are all kinds of you can also shepherd
it gravitationally with with a spacecraft all kinds of suggestions for what to do and
it really depends on the size of the object and the composition as to what we want to do you don't
want to for example destroy it into a lot of fragments because those fragments could hit the
earth with a higher chance you know during the Gulf War there was this Patriot missile that
intercepted the the missiles that were sent for example towards Israel and at the early version
of these Patriot missiles they just blasted the incoming missile into pieces and that caused
more damage than the original missile would of course so you don't want to do that and we can
we will have enough time to make appropriate plans depending on which object is approaching us
we will definitely not get extinct as the dinosaurs did the human brain even though it's much smaller
than the body of a dinosaur it's much more precious for long-term survival
now why is it that you think that you're the first astronomer to come out with some some fascinating
stuff like this talking about the Imumu and talking about interstellar potential extraterrestrial
objects right our solar system well first I should mention you know that this subject is
at the periphery of astronomy it's not funded much and anyone that talks about the search for
technological signatures is sort of marginalized sometimes to the point where the subject is
ridiculed and that is unfortunate because it doesn't bring it doesn't allow new talent to enter the
field or to get funded for doing research in this in this field and it's sort of like stepping on
the grass and then saying look it doesn't grow so obviously we don't get major discoveries or
important results because of the this self-fulfilling prophecy that the fact that the community is not
supporting it and I find this to be completely inappropriate because the public is extremely
interested in the question are we alone I'm interested in the question beyond that because
I think that we are probably not alone you know half of the sun-like stars have a planet the size
of the earth roughly at the same separation so you have billions of earth-sun systems
just within the Milky Way galaxy our own galaxy and then you have a trillion galaxies like the
Milky Way within the observable volume of the universe so altogether you know there are more
earth-sun systems than the numbers of grains of sand on all beaches on earth it's just huge
and the chance that we're special or unique is really minute and out of modesty we should
consider the possibility that things like us exist everywhere as the simplest assumption you know a
most conservative assumption if you replicate the same circumstances you get the same outcome
but for some reason the mainstream community prefers not to think that way and say you know
maybe we are unique maybe we are special you need extraordinary evidence in order to argue otherwise
I would argue that you need extraordinary evidence to assume that we are unique because
whenever we thought that we are special we were wrong you know in the past we thought that we are
the center of the universe Aristotle suggested that in his philosophy and for a thousand years
people believed it until Copernicus and Galileo demonstrated that the earth moves around the sun
and even then the philosophers at the time didn't like the idea they didn't look for Galileo's
telescope and they just maintain their ignorance you know that reality doesn't care about whether
we ignore it or not and whenever we assume that we are unique and special we were wrong
it's sort of like my daughters when they were infants you know they thought that they are
unique they have qualities that nobody else has and they're at the center of the world
but once they went to a kindergarten they saw other kids and they got a better perspective
so for us as the human species as civilization to mature we need to find others and get a better
perspective about our place in the universe but many people prefer you know it flutters their ego
to maintain the view that we are alone until proven differently and I find that to be completely
opposite to where they should be but by preventing any research in this subject by ridiculing
suggestions that we might not be alone you know you don't get anyone to work on that
and that's why I'm sort of alone standing against this mainstream and I should say you know I'm not
an outlier I've worked in the mainstream for many years I had a lot of leadership positions
I was the longest serving chair of the astronomy department at Harvard between 2011 to 2020
nine years a position that was renewed twice and I'm the chair of the board on physics and
astronomy of the national academies and at the same time I think that the current view is misguided
and I think that this subject appeals to the public and the public funds science and therefore we
have an obligation to address it with the existing tools that we have telescopes and instruments
and we can do it just to give you an example you know the astronomers are developing the next
generation of instruments to search for and this would cost billions of dollars to search for oxygen
for example in the atmospheres of planets around other stars because the idea is that oxygen will
tell us if there is life on these planets around other stars the problem with this idea is that
oxygen was rare did not exist in the earth atmosphere at noticeable levels for two billion
years for half of the lifetime of the earth for the first two billion years there wasn't much oxygen
in the atmosphere but there was life on earth there were microbes so not finding oxygen is not
evidence that life doesn't exist also finding oxygen is not evidence that life exists because
we can make it by natural processes and if you ask yourself what would be a conclusive
signature of life is if we find industrial pollution in those atmospheres those molecules
that are very complex and are produced by the industries that we have or by refrigerating
systems they are called CFCs if we do find evidence for those then we know that life
must exist so in fact the justification to the future the next generation of instruments that
astronomers are developing is much stronger in the context of the search for technological
signatures than it is in the search for primitive life but nevertheless you would never find an
argument or a motivation for these instruments in that context what sort of conversations have you
had or debates have you had with with your colleagues or other astronomers when it comes
to the pushback that you've received from being outspoken about things like this and the Amua
Mua and intelligent life well I can give you an example there was a seminar about the Amua Mua at
Harvard and when I left the room with a colleague of mine that worked on the solar system for decades
he said this object is so weird I wish it never existed and that illustrates to you that
the properties of this object take people away from their comfort zone and most people prefer not
to change their views and not to update what they thought to be the worldview that describes the
universe and it's sort of like a GPS system when it gets to a place that it doesn't recognize
it says recalculating and unfortunately most of my colleagues do not recalculate they just
want to maintain their views so most of the mainstream would simply say business as usual
I don't care about the details it must be a rock to me that sounds just like a caveman
saying that when presented with a cell phone you know the caveman is used to work you know playing
with rocks all of his life saying oh the cell phone is just a shiny rock and the point of the
matter is since I don't find in technological signatures as a speculation I think it should
be contemplated as a real possibility put on the table and then you know one can gather more evidence
to try and see if indeed it's consistent with that and it should not be dismissed up dismissed
up front and so I think there needs to be a revision in the culture right now that
within the academic community there are also parts of for example physics the physics community
theoretical physics that engage in concepts that cannot be tested experimentally such as
extra dimensions or the multiverse or supersymmetry or string theory these are concepts that were not
yet proven to be correct based on experimental evidence they are highly speculative and for
decades people have been working on them and doing mathematical gymnastics or about demonstrating
how smart they are but you know that doing physics is not about showing off as being smart
it's about understanding reality understanding nature and if you're trying to do that you should
be guided by evidence yeah I mean there's tons of there's tons of money that goes into things
like the LHC that they go to find the Higgs boson and all those other things it's amazing that
I would imagine and correct me if I'm wrong the number one thing on the checklist of reasons
to become an astronomer would be to find extraterrestrial life or to or to find something
out there well in fact a lot of physicists would say that they were attracted to doing physics
because they read some science fiction stories and I think that this is the most exciting question
for us to address because it will change our perspective about our place in the universe
our aspirations for space and it could impact many things we do including religious beliefs you know
and and so I think it's just a missed opportunity for scientists if they have the tools to address
this question and search for technological signatures not to do that and that's why I speak
speak out loud and I use Oumuamua as an anchor to demonstrate that here is an anomalous object
that didn't look like anything we have seen before and all of the mainstream suggestions for why
it looks so weird also invoked something that we have never seen before you know a hydrogen
iceberg or a cloud of dust and then given that we are entertaining possibilities that were never
seen before why not also a technological origin it's sort of like you know walking on the beach
and most of the time you see rocks or seashells but every now and then you stumble across a plastic
bottle that indicates that the civilization might be around so how did you first come across this
Oumuamua well I heard about it when it was discovered on October 19th 2017 and after a week or so
it was it became quite intriguing in the sense that you know we realized it's the first interstellar
object looks a little bit strange in terms of its shape and so I had a discussion with
Yuri Milner a Russian-Israeli science funder in Silicon Valley about using radio telescopes to
which he had access through a project called Breakthrough Listen and trying to see if there
is any radio signal coming from this object we checked it and put an upper limit of roughly the
transmission of a cell phone so clearly Oumuamua was not transmitting at the frequencies that we
were looking at the radio frequencies it could have been transmitting at other frequencies
could have been transmitting in a different direction but we ruled out the possibility that
anything in our direction was more than the power of a cell phone and so at that point you know I
thought well it must be probably natural but then six months later there was the report about
it showing exhibiting an extra push away from the sun and that could not be explained in terms of a
cometary tail because we haven't seen any and at that point you know that was the straw that
broke the camels back in my vocabulary in terms of me saying to myself look it's so unusual maybe
we should look for something out of the box to explain it and I wrote a couple of articles in
Scientific American talking about it being a technological artifact or relic and then
wrote a scientific paper about it in October 2018 that got a lot of attention we didn't have any
press release it just became viral in the media and after that I wrote a number of papers on
Oumuamua and its implications so you mentioned it was moving away from the sun well when we
discovered it it was already receding away from us yes it's sort of like having a guest for dinner
and realizing that the guest is interesting when the guest goes out the front door into the dark
street and that was unfortunate because we couldn't chase it at that point if we were
to discover it in July instead of October and by the way I was visiting that observatory the
Panstar Observatory on Mount Haleakala in Maui just around that time July 2017 with my family
we were on vacation in Maui and I gave a seminar there and at the time nobody knew about Oumuamua
if we were to know about it then we could have contemplating sending out a spacecraft equipped
with a camera along its path and then getting a better view of what it looks like unfortunately
we didn't know and so it was too late for us to chase it afterwards and the the moral of this story
is that if we find another weird object in the future on its approach to us we better send the
camera that will take a photograph of it and you know a picture is worth a thousand words
right now is that something that you think we'll be able to do next time one of these
is coming close to us yeah I think it's quite possible and science is all about the evidence
and it's about reproducibility the ability to study something again and again when it repeats
and in this case given the fact that Panstar's looked surveyed the sky for a few years before
he discovered this object we should definitely find another one that looks like it within a few
years from now because it's otherwise it's very unlikely that we found a rare object just within
a few years now what were the main differences between this and other things that you see like
asteroids or comets or something like that obviously the shape was different and yeah the
shape the shape was more extreme it was projected on the sky 10 times longer than it is wide and
imagine a piece of paper tumbling in the wind even if it's raised or thin the chance of it being
exactly edge on is very small so most of the time you know it would change the amount of area that
you see but the change by a factor of 10 or more is quite extreme and the second is that you know we
infer that it's most likely flat based on the amount of light that it reflected this it was
tumbling what do you think it was what do you think it legitimately was well I think it was probably
a very thin object artificially produced and probably dysfunctional not something that is
being used for spying on us or some other purpose simply because it was tumbling it was out of control
in a way but also if you think about it we sent out Voyager one Voyager two new horizons all kinds
of space junk and a million years from now all of this would be real junk in the sense that it
will not be functional anymore so if you wait long for long times you know the these objects
that are being sent into space may not continue to be functional they don't have enough energy
supply to keep them functional and there might be a lot of them floating in space just like plastic
bottles in the ocean you know that are swept ashore and we find them find them many every now
and then so it's sort of like waste filling up interstellar space and every now and then we will
bump into one now could you define exactly what interstellar does that mean not bound to the sun
if it's well yeah interstellar well in general more generally interstellar means between stars
and then in this so in this context you can say or more more came from the space between
stars it came into the solar system from outside the solar system the question about its origin
is not answered because we don't know where it came from it was actually another weird
fact about it is that it was situated in a special frame of reference it was in the local
standard of rest which is the frame that you get to when you average over the motions of all the
stars in the vicinity of the sun and the umumu was at rest in that frame so it's sort of like
finding a car that is parked at rest in a public parking lot you cannot really tell which house it
came from because all the stars in the case of the local standard of rest all the local stars
are moving relative to that frame only one in 500 stars is so much at rest relative to the local
standard of rest as umumu was one way to think about it it was like a buoy sitting on the surface
of the ocean and the solar system bumped into it because the sun is moving relative to that frame
and you may ask what purpose does it serve being in that special frame you know one possibility is
that there is a grid of such objects and they serve as a road posts when you navigate through
interstellar space you can find your coordinates where you are relative to those objects and
other possibilities that it's a relay station for communication that um you don't need to
communicate across large distances you just communicate by the signal hopping from one
relay station to the next we use this approach on earth now what did you say the name of the
name of the telescope that was being the new telescope the billion dollar there are will
oh the name of the telescope that we surveyed the sky you mean yeah you mentioned that there
was like a billion dollar telescope being built in Chile well there is the vera rubin observatory
that will be much more sensitive than the panstas telescope that was that discovered umumu in Hawaii
and it will be in Chile yes okay and the primary focus of that will be to discover these things
before it's too late yeah discover near-earth objects with much greater sensitivity than
panstas and it will be able to find about two-thirds of those that the congress tasked
nasa to find you know so 60 of the entire population what are your opinions on in the
recent year or two all of the different you know there's been air force pilots in base in
san diego that have come out and they've had their videos of these ufo's coming out of the water and
within one second being meters away do you guys pay any attention to that stuff well i do i mean
i cannot speak for others um and um my view on these reports these eyewitness reports of
unidentified flying objects ufo's that are unusual um my my view is that um these eyewitness
testimonies come from people that are not scientists that were not planning to find these
unusual things and uh we will be better served if we were to deploy scientific instruments
in those sites and monitor the environment um you know what i have two concerns about these
reports of ufo's over the past decades one of them is that now we have cameras and recording devices
that are far better than we had decades ago and back then you know the images were fuzzy
and it was difficult to be sure that what it means and so forth but with present day instruments it
should be crisp clear uh they're much better than we used to have and they are still fuzzy and you
know the margin of believability uh the second reservation that they have is there are far many
more cameras uh available to monitor environments right now uh by orders of magnitude you know uh
people have cell phones you have drones you have cameras on satellites on airplanes on the in the
streets of cities and the the number of uh video cameras looking at what's going on is many orders
of magnitude larger than it used to be a decade or two ago nevertheless the reports on ufo's have
not increased uh so that concerns me that maybe you know all of these reports were sort of uh
artifacts of the instruments that were used or impressions of natural phenomena uh but i think
that it would be appropriate to deploy scientific instruments and and check it out uh it's really
i mean science is about reproducibility of results um so one time events are not believable in science
you should be able to reproduce them by being in the same environment under similar circumstances
and i would trust instruments recording these events you know there is this um biblical story
from the old testament about abraham that they heard the voice of god and that voice told abraham
to sacrifice his only son isaac and imagine abraham having a cell phone with a voice memo
up if he could have pressed the button he would have recorded the voice of god and then instead
of an eyewitness testimony we would have the recording and that would have convinced all of
humanity that god exists and so my point is that by recording things on instruments you get a much
more objective evidence than all these reports that are now being declassified from the pentagon
and so forth we should not obsess with these old reports that were based on either eyewitnesses
or instruments that are much more inferior to the instruments we have now we should simply
use our best instruments go to these sites and see what we whether we see anything unusual
well the pentagon actually said that they were in possession of some sort of
inter or extraterrestrial craft on in the new york times article well what i'm saying is
that it's better you know abraham said that he heard the voice of god right so the question
is do you believe abraham or not i'm saying if he had a cell phone we could have looked at the
evidence he didn't have that and then you have to decide whether you believe the biblical story
or not and the same is true here people report things and i don't know whether to believe them so
the only way for me to believe them scientifically speaking is to deploy recording devices in the
same sites and see if they find something what is your opinion on humans and how long we're
going to be here on earth do you think we're ever going to have to leave earth oh yeah definitely
currently all our eggs are in one basket and everything that is precious to us
could get eliminated extinct if something catastrophic happens on earth if an asteroid
impacts us or if there is a for example a nuclear war or a climate change or something
catastrophic and it would make much more sense to spread our eggs in different baskets and go
somewhere else as well and have duplicates of what we hold important and valuable here it's sort of
like the Gutenberg printing press you know there were very few copies of the bible before the
printing press was invented then they were all handwritten and each of them was extremely precious
but once the printing press came to exist there were many more copies and if something bad happened
to one of them it wasn't a catastrophe you could make new ones and then we can imagine saving life
as we know it on earth and the approach would be similar to what Noack did you know in the
biblical story of Noack's Ark there is the story about the great flood that endangered life on earth
and so Noack decided to build an ark and put animals in it so that it will save them we can
in principle design a similar approach and build Noack spaceship that will save life on earth
but we don't need to put elephants and you know whales on it we just need to put a computer and
a 3d printer and if the computer has the information about the DNA of all life forms that
that we care about then this system can go to another planet and in principle it could make
the life as we know it out of the raw materials that exist there on another planet you don't need to
bring the life with you you can recreate them as long as we figure out how to make synthetic life
you know and that's not speculative because people are as we speak people are trying to
produce synthetic life in the laboratory and so I wouldn't be surprised if within the next
few decades we will be able to do that and so once we are able to do that we can potentially
produce life on other planets without carrying it from earth and just you know using what we
know about the genetics and and so forth in making that life over there out of the raw materials
there how long do you think it would be before we would have to do that oh that depends on us
how quickly we inflict the wounds on ourselves you know if if we are not smart enough we might
not survive for more than a few centuries from now we started developing our technologies about
a century ago and our technologies are advancing with exponentially with a characteristic timescale
of a few years so it's quite possible that within the next century you know we unless we are careful
we could develop technologies that will destroy us and then you know we need to be really careful
about what we do to the planet what we do to ourselves we don't pay that much attention to it
because we are so close to when technology started developing but once we go a few decades into the
future we will be in a real risk of extinction I think and because there would be technologies that
could potentially destroy life on the planet and then we just need to be smart enough to avoid that
and right now I wouldn't say that we are very intelligent in the way we do our politics there
are lots of conflicts and we invest most of our efforts in fighting each other you know among
nations and so forth and that is not the smart approach we should collaborate especially on
issues that science can address you know and you could see that in the context of covid right so
when it started in China there wasn't much sharing of information the world and science is global
science is international it's supposed to be a mode of collaboration among nations and in promoting
a better future for humanity and I very much hope that then ultimately science will prevail
and suppress all these tensions among people that really could bring us down you know if
if you look at the world wars there was a lot of effort dedicated to killing people and that
makes no sense whatsoever yeah I think especially recently I feel like the internet has really
made everything in this world so much more transparent and I think it's it's really there's
a big paradigm shift happening especially with the recent news I'm sure you've heard the
game stop stocks the people online that were buying the stocks the hedge funds bet against
and 10 years ago this is something no one understood hedge funds or the stock market
or or what these bets on them failing even were and people were able to benefit off that
and essentially create this massive gap this massive gap between the the billionaires on
wall street and the average the average working person blue collar worker and now it's becoming
the internet has made this so much more transparent I feel like this is something that has to happen
with side that's you know you can somehow correlate it to what's happening with what you're doing
and now you released your book and you're talking to everybody about it well one thing I would like
to highlight in this context is we tend to think that the technology and science is superior to
the humanities you know so humanities are in decline the study of philosophies the study of
literature and so forth young people are more attracted to science and technology the problem
is that we develop tools using science and technology that could destroy us and the only
way to prevent it is to have the humanists telling us how to guide ourselves towards a better future
you know how to for example how to set the rules such that genetic engineering will not end up
making you know people the type that we want and all kinds of other issues that come up like
artificial intelligence you know if we allow it to make life death decisions on medical issues
we have to worry about the the morality of that and you know at what level do we allow the machine
to decide the fate of a person versus having people involved you know in the past it was the
doctor that made the decision and you could trust the doctor better because the doctor would be a
human that that has a bigger perspective that is more balanced in a way but if you have a machine
deciding you have to decide about a set of rules of what's moral and what's what's ethical and
how the machine decides who dies and who lives you know and uh there are lots of such issues
with modern technologies and the humanities the way I see it plays a central role and you know I
as a young kid I was mostly interested in philosophy I grew up on a farm and then circumstances brought
me into physics and astrophysics but I value these areas of humanities like philosophy very much I
think they are essential for guiding us to a better future without them we could be nerds developing
all kinds of tools that will kill us as as a civilization yeah so how did you transition
from studying things like black holes to studying what you're studying now like how did you make
that transition well it it was by by chance because um for example I was studying the first generation
of stars in the universe the first stars that formed that lit up in the universe early on
and those stars had an impact on their environment they basically broke the hydrogen atoms around
them into their constituent electrons and protons and uh and then if you want to see the scars left
by the first stars on their environment you want to image the hydrogen around them and uh hydrogen
emits faint radio waves and uh therefore I worked on a frontier that talks about you know tries to
map the hydrogen in the early universe and for that purpose you need to develop radio
observatories observatories are sensitive at radio frequencies of around 100 to 200 megahertz
and it so happens that these radio observatories operated exactly the same frequency band as
FM radio stations and tv stations and uh one concern was that there would be interference from
tv and radio stations on earth but then it occurred to me that the same observatories
could in principle eavesdrop on another civilization you know on a planet around another star that
transmits those radio waves and so I wrote a paper about it that was my first encounter with a search
for technological signatures then I was I visited Abu Dhabi for the inauguration of a new campus for
NYU and that was around 2012 or so and then the tour guide when we looked at when we went around
the tour guide there was bragging that the city lights there are visible from the moon they're
so bright and so that gave me the idea of checking how far can you see a city with the Hubble space
telescope for example and we found with Ed Turner a collaborator of mine that in principle the Hubble
space telescope can see a city like Tokyo on Pluto you know the edge of the solar system of planets
and that was an interesting idea that you can look for artificial lights as a signature of
another civilization and you can identify these artificial lights not as reflected sunlight
by the way the source deems as it changes its distance from us so that was my second paper
and then the third one on this subject was when astronomers talked about searching for
biological signatures in the atmospheres of planets and then it occurred to me that
you know if you look for industrial pollution that would imply there is an industrial civilization
there and so I wrote a paper about that and and so gradually drifted in this direction that was 2015
and and then over the past few years especially because of a mua-mua I published a lot on this
subject and in about half a year I will have a book a textbook out of more than a thousand
pages with my former postdoc Manas Vilinga that lays the foundation for future studies on this
subject of the search for both primitive and intelligent life you mentioned earlier when you
were talking about 3d printing and and printing organisms or basically duplicating ourselves on
other planets now I've heard reports of of people who have worked at s1 and area 51 have
obtained crafts that are very small saying that only really tiny beings that have no
reproductive organs is it possible that other that other beings are printing these sort of
cadavers or uh basically like humanoids but aliens that can travel long distances
through different solar systems that don't have to stay alive they don't have to eat
you know everything is possible and there are lots of possibilities outlined in science fiction
stories and uh the key as a scientist is to look for evidence and that should guide you as to which
possibilities are real and which are illusions or or uh you know our imagination of what might be
out there uh it's sort of like a detective story you can have a lot of possibly an infinite number
of possibilities and you just sort them out and figure out which one is realized by collecting
clues and evidence you know and we could think that we you know we are wealthier than Elon
Musk we could have a lot of money um and the the only way to figure out what we actually have is to
go to an ATM machine and check it out and so the ATM machine represents an experiment where you
actually check uh what you have and uh that's what guides modern science evidence and clues
many times scientists prefer to have ideas that do not stand up to the scrutiny of experiments
and that's that's legitimate as long as the ideas can be tested in principle uh the frustration I
have is that some parts of the physics community right now uh you know there are hundreds of people
working on ideas that will never be tested in their lifetime and that to me could be a waste of their
time because it's imagining things that they may not exist if we were to go and put ourselves on
another planet which planet do you think it would be do you think it'd be mars or would it be would
it be a proxima b so there are two planets that are closest to us and in principle
could have life on them or we could imagine going there and changing conditions such that we could
live there uh they are mars and venus on the two sides of the earth uh mars used to have an atmosphere
and probably had conditions similar to earth early on in its life but then because it's 10 times
less massive than the earth it couldn't hold on to its atmosphere so the atmosphere evaporated
and then it lost the potential for for liquid water on its surface because you can't have liquid
water unless there is an atmospheric pressure and so even if there was life on mars it couldn't
continue uh there was no liquid water available and the perseverance mission will actually get
there in february 2021 in about in less than in a few weeks actually and we'll figure out whether
there was or maybe there is some left over signatures of life in the martian soil
and so that would be very exciting and we i i'm very much looking forward to seeing the results
from this mission um but then going there for us for humans would require a lot of adaptation
because uh just standing on the surface of mars without an atmosphere without a strong magnetic
field that mars doesn't have uh we will be exposed to energetic particles cosmic rays
that could damage within a year you will have a substantial damage to
the cells in your brain and you need protection from that and one way to protect our bodies is
to go underground to go into a cave or to build some infrastructure that will protect us there is
not enough attention given to that so just sending humans to mars without proper protection
would be irresponsible it's sort of like a death sentence you don't want to do that
um so we need to come up with the solutions to protect people that go there uh but potentially
it's a place that we could then modify such that we could live there and then you can imagine not
necessarily going to a planet you can put some platform in space you know we we started in the
jungles of africa and we ended up in apartment buildings in cities uh that's a big leap over a
period of 100 000 years um i don't see the leap from an apartment building you know in a city in
Manhattan to to going to space as big as the leap from africa to to an apartment building you know so
we could do it it really requires some time but you know 100 000 years is a huge period you know
over which we will have technologies that are far superior to what we have now so i'm quite optimistic
that we could adapt to like living in space but it will take some time and then venus uh venus
right now on the surface has you know it went through uh greenhouse effect and the surface is
extremely hot it cannot sustain liquid water you cannot live on the surface of venus uh there was
some suggestion that maybe there is life in the clouds of venus so the only way for us to inhabit
venus would be to terraform it to change the condition such that it's not as as hot as it is
but then of course we can go to proxima b we can go to another star the nearest star is
proxima centauri and it has a habitable planet next to it uh and that's planet is star that
it has a permanent day side and a permanent night side and then my daughter say that
the the the strip that separates those two sides is the most would have the highest real
estate value because it would be a permanent sunset strip and have a house there you can see the
sunset forever for dummies like myself who've never heard of proxima b or proxima the other one
can you explain where they are and where what they are yeah proxima centauri is a member of a
three star system that is the closest to the sun right now i mean it will continue to be the closest
star system to us for about a hundred thousand years so every hundred thousand years or so there
is a new star coming closest to us and then it's passing um and right now proxima centauri
is the nearest and it's actually a dwarf star that is only 12 of the mass of the sun so it's
much fainter most of the stars are much smaller and fainter than the sun uh so we live next to
an unusual star most of the stars are are like proxima centauri and then it has roughly half the
surface temperature that the sun has only three thousand degrees Kelvin compared to
almost six thousand that the sun has and therefore it emits mostly infrared light the sun emits
mostly visible light that's why our eyes are tuned to visible light but the creatures if there are
any creatures on the habitable planet next to proxima centauri they should have infrared eyes
which would be very strange for us to see actually uh and if there is any grass growing there it would
be dark red so if you think about interstellar travel agencies designing trips more if more if
most of the living creatures are living near dwarf stars that are the most common uh they are used
to red to dark red grass and they will never come to a planet like ours that offers green grass
that will not be a desirable tourist destination because they don't like this color they enjoy
having a vacation on a dark red grass you know and that may explain why we haven't seen any visitors
can you explain a little bit more what would the eyes of the beings on that planet look like
why would they be what would an infrared eye look like i don't know it would look
shocking to us it would look very different than our eyes so our eyes were developed over time to
take advantage of most of the light produced by the sun which is visible light
but if you are next to a star that produces mostly infrared radiation then evolution would lead you
to be sensitive to that kind of light you know this is the kind of light you get from warm objects
you know like um uh soldiers have those goggles that are sensitive to infrared radiation at night
when there is at night there is not much in uh visible light because you're on the other side
of the earth where the sun is not around and you know and and and but objects are warm enough
to emit infrared radiation and and you can see them with these goggles that's what they saw you
know people that have infrared goggles can see the heat emitted by bodies that are warm
and that's that's the kind of infrared radiation that the the star proximus centauri is mostly
emitting so of course if we had goggles infrared goggles we would see that radiation very clearly
but those animals that creatures that may be born there they have those
sensors infrared sensors and that they are born with because that gives them an evolutionary
advantage the reason we have visible light eyes is because it gives us an advantage we can survive
better if we see the light from the sun because it's reflected off objects so we can protect
ourselves if if there is something endangering us we can avoid that danger by seeing that object
and that's why we have sensitivity to visible light which is the most common type of light near
the sun but if we were next to proximus centauri it would not offer us much advantage and then
probably we would not survive and animals that have infrared eyes would survive because they
can see the danger if there is another animal coming to eat them they would be able to escape
because that's sensitive to infrared light which is the most common form of light in their environment
real quick i wanted to go back to the mission you just spoke about that's about to arrive in
mars in a couple weeks now well what is the purpose of that mission they're looking specifically for
life right so this is the perseverance mission and yes one of the highlights of this mission is to
search for signatures of life and there were previous missions going back almost 50 years
that had some tentative evidence that perhaps there is something in the martian soil that
is going through metabolism that is living because they took a sample of that soil and they noticed
that there is some gas coming out of it that may indicate life and and when they heat that soil
to a high temperature suddenly that goes away and there was a suggestion that maybe it indicates
that there is life in that soil and and so the perseverance mission is equipped with all kinds
of instruments that could then search for life that may exist right now but also search for
life that may have existed before you know if there were rivers or or ponds in the location
where perseverance lands then there might be some leftover signatures of life that may have existed
there and we don't know exactly how it might look it might be skeletons or something else but
the idea is to search for it and it would be very exciting to see what they find yeah i mean it sounds
like we're doing everything we can possibly do within our means to to do these types of studies
and to try to find extraterrestrial life and to find out if we're the only ones here or well
primitive primitive life i should say because technological signatures we are not doing enough
that's what i started from i've heard you compare stagnation of the scientific community to technology
or or to corporate uh commercial technology because you know companies like SpaceX for example
which obviously are funded and they generate a profit compared to um science and the communities
that you're involved in can you speak a little bit to that yeah so one would expect the the
academic world to take more risks than the commercial world because companies are mainly
focused on making a profit whereas in academia there is this concept of tenure where the professor
has a secure job and the purpose of that was that once you get to that phase you can explore
blue sky research and take risks and you know allow yourself to be wrong if it doesn't end up
the way you wanted unfortunately most of my colleagues in academia do not take risks because
they want to get honors and awards and they want to maintain an image of someone that
doesn't make mistakes and they build echo chambers that repeat their voice makes it making it louder
so that the reputation is improved but at the same time they don't innovate much because innovation
implies taking risks and being wrong sometimes and at the same time in the commercial sector
you find companies as you mentioned like SpaceX or Google or many others that that have groups of
people that are thinking that are taking risks and checking ideas out of the box and the reason
they do that is because they recognize that the next major discovery that will make them a big
profit would come in unexpected directions so they are taking risks because even though some of the
directions fail if one of them ends up being real it would compensate for all the losses
associated with the failed directions and if companies recognize the value of that
academia should have recognized it much more and you know it's quite unfortunate that there is not
as much innovation in academia as it should as there should be and that's why I'm trying to promote
an open mind in the context that we discussed before of searching for technological signatures
but more more generally I think it's extremely important for example for federal grants to be
given also to people that have risky propositions people that consider ideas out of the box
NASA for example very often funds projects that can declare ahead of time what they will discover
what they will find and that's contradictory to the nature of discovery very often you discover
things that you haven't expected you cannot tell in advance to the funder what you will find or
else what you're doing is very boring so I think the funding agencies should also allocate some
fraction of their funding to risky propositions to out of the box thinking and allow for that
it all comes together in a culture where innovation and risk-taking is appreciated
yeah it almost doesn't make sense it almost seems like somebody like Elon Musk would have way more
to lose by venturing outside the box than a than a researcher or a scientist what it seems like
I agree I completely agree but it's human nature to drives people in academia towards
and less being less innovative less risk-taking because this way they can maintain an image
that makes no you know of someone reputable so that they get honors and awards and by the way
one way to not not make mistakes is not to put the skin in the game so not to be engaged in
predictions that can be tested experimentally and proven wrong and that's why you find this
culture of people that work on subjects that are sort of phasoteric have no connection to reality
and cannot be tested experimentally because that's much more attractive you can just demonstrate
that you are smart and never be proven wrong isn't that the point of science to be proven wrong
yes I would argue that and that's what I argue yes and that's what I practice I don't just preach
but it's not easy to change the culture and I think it should change and I hope it will change
and my book discusses that as one of the most important messages of the books I very much
encourage people to have a look in it and you talk about Einstein as well yeah I mean Einstein
in the last decade of his career when he was the most experienced and obviously he was the leading
scientist of his generation made three mistakes and these were major mistakes that we now know are
completely wrong based on experiments you know we detected gravitational waves
and he claimed they don't exist we detected black holes he claimed they don't exist and
we also detected spooky action at a distance in quantum mechanics and he claimed it doesn't exist
and but that's part of being at the frontier you never know in advance you know what is the
right direction and even if you are the smartest person around like Einstein was you make mistakes
and that should be tolerated because if you look at Einstein you know he also made important
breakthroughs at the same time or before that time and so the other thing is his generation was
putting skin in the game you know he was making predictions and they were tested the current
generation wants to always be valued as smart without putting any skin in the game so they
you know a lot of physicists theoretical physicists are doing intellectual gymnastics
they're using sophisticated mathematics and that serves the role of demonstrating they're smart
but it doesn't necessarily describe nature do you think some of the reason that you're getting a
lot of backlash is because people are threatened by you coming out and talking about this maybe
they see Avi getting all this attention and talking about this but they've never gotten this
this amount of attention from anyone about any of their ideas well one aspect of that is jealousy
of course for that tension but another one is because I address my main message is that we
should be modest that science is a learning experience and that making mistakes is okay
that's part of the scientific process you know we should be just like kids trying to understand
the world and willing to not be so attached to our egos so I'm trying to remove that connection
between the ego of a scientist and the profession you know we are trying to understand nature we
should engage in a dialogue with experiments we should not consider it as an evaluation of
our abilities it's not about us it's about understanding nature and it's a dialogue with
experiments and we just have to start from a point of modesty you know and that modesty is
communicated to us by looking at the universe you know we are so small we are so so shortly
how can anyone be arrogant okay that makes no sense to me how can anyone be racist you know that
also makes no sense to me because just based on the color of his skin you decide what the person is
I mean that's completely ridiculous so people have this tendency of wanting to feel superior to
other people either by demonstrating that they are smart or by demonstrating that their DNA may be
superior to others all kinds of ways of demonstrating superiority and it all drives it all stems
from their ego and what I say is just leave that aside that causes the worst in human nature you
know all of the wars all of the the worst things that happen in human history were driven by ego
we should try to push it aside be as modest as possible which is what the universe is telling us
stay modest you are not at the center of anything and we might be we might not be the smartest kid
on the block I'm trying to convey this message and the pushback is in part because people are too
attached to their ego it bothers them takes them out of the comfort zone they want to feel as if
they are respected smart never make mistakes never have to revise their view of the universe
just like the philosophers during the days of Galileo they didn't want to look through the
telescope because they were happy believing that they are at the center of the universe
they were comfortable where they were exactly it's sort of like my daughters
saying we don't want to go to a kindergarten you know at home if we have a small enough environment
at home we feel as if we are you know the smartest kid there is nobody like us we feel great that's
our comfort zone we will never go out and you know that's sort of the tendency not to explore
because then you feel proud of yourself you can be arrogant if you limit your view to a small
environment but it's it goes against the fundamentals of science because exactly staying comfortable
inhibits growth the only exactly that's my point right exactly and then and that's why I have this
battle and then by the way I'm getting a huge response from the public a lot of emails also
from people in academia that feel the same mostly young people because young people are not attached
as much to their ego and I'm hopeful for the future you know I I do not care how many likes
I have on Twitter I just I'm focused you know just like basketball coaches advice their team players
keep your eyes on the ball not on the audience and that's what I'm trying to do
now you don't even have any social media right no I don't because my wife asked me
not to have any and I respected that and I don't miss that because it frees my time and also allows
me to be more creative without being biased by the herd that you know view so for my audience that
you don't have any social media so people that are listening or watching this
what can you suggest to them to learn more about what you're doing or to find
more of your writings or your books yeah they can go to my website by putting my name on Google
Avilov and I have a main website where I list my commentaries in Scientific American I publish
roughly once a week or once every two weeks I also have scientific papers more than 800 of them
listed there and books and they're welcome to say anyone is welcome to send me an email
and I'll be glad to correspond so in general I I do have communication with a broad audience
but not through social media that's amazing man well hey I'm super grateful for you
having this conversation with me I really appreciate it I've learned a lot from you
my pleasure thank you for having me
