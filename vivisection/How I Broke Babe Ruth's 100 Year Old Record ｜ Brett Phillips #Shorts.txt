A Grand Slam is because other guys did their job.
So it doesn't necessarily line up like that all the time just because of how hard hitting
is.
Well, I got to come up to the plate like three, three or four times in a matter of 21 days
and I was blessed enough to hit three Grand Slams in 21 days or 19 days as opposed to
Babe Ruth in 30 days and it broke his record.
And I was just like, this is crazy.
At the time, I didn't think I was breaking any records, but then to see that a play has
been around for a record has not been broken for 100 years and they asked me how does it
make me feel?
Man, like I don't know how to feel like I don't, that doesn't feel right.
Put Babe Ruth back ahead of me even though I broke the record.
Keep him above.
