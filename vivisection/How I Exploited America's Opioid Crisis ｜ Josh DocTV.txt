Hello world. Today my guest is Josh from DOC TV on YouTube. Josh did six years in prison
for doctor shopping and essentially exploited the opioid crisis by selling very large amounts
of prescription painkillers like OxyCot. His YouTube channel is all about prison and exposing
the corruption in the Florida Department of Corrections. He does a very good job explaining
his experience in the system and what needs to be changed not only in the prison system
but also in the legal system. This conversation was gripping from start to finish truly. Without
further ado please welcome Josh from DOC TV.
What up Josh?
What's up man?
How you doing man?
I'm good bro.
How you doing?
You got a really cool YouTube channel.
Yeah.
You ain't lying.
Where do you find these people at?
Well first before you get into that tell people out there who don't know who you are. Give
them a brief background on who you are and how you started your YouTube channel.
Alright so my name is Josh. It's DOC TV 813 on YouTube and how I started it was I kind
of fell down the wormhole on YouTube about like two years ago and I saw a lot of people
talking about prison, violence, the corruption and everything that goes on. So I kind of
just chilled for a little bit and I watched some more of it and then I was like man I
got all these stories plus some. So it really did it was I got hired at a gym to be a personal
training manager. It was a gym just opening and the owner when we first started talking
he said if you sell ten thousand dollars in personal training in the first month of us
being open I'm going to give you this bonus, that bonus and he was just going over like
a pay structure. Well the time came and the month came and I did and he didn't pay me
like he I don't know what he thought he was doing but I went to ask him for my paycheck
because I didn't get one and he's like well little things came up and he's like giving
me the run around I'm like bro when are you going to fucking pay me right? So he doesn't
pay me I'd end up suing the dude to get my money and what he told me to my face when
I asked him the last time was no one's going to believe you because you're a felon and
you've been to prison. So I was like. So he was scamming you from the beginning probably.
Yeah bro so it made me like I mean I wanted to work for myself, YouTube there's a you
know you can do well on YouTube if you do it right so that's what made me want to do
it to begin with and then obviously like helping other people from my mistakes and when they
watch my shit I'm sure they're going to be like bro I don't want to go down that road.
How long did you go to prison for?
Total of six years I went twice actually.
You went twice?
Yeah I had to run my head into the wall.
Man was it hard to get back on your feet after getting out? They definitely don't make it
easy I mean just by you know having people in here like Matt Cox and other people you
know we've heard a lot of stories about it's an uphill battle to try to like get back into
the groove of society and make it 100% because the deck is stacked against you once you get
out.
Yeah man it's hard like you you know once you have a felony on your record you can't
buy a house in certain places you can't rent in certain places and I don't have a trade
I didn't go to school you know what I mean I mean I have a trade with personal training
but as far as anything other than that I didn't so that's what I got when I got out of prison
was certified and personal training started doing that and then I ran into the guy at
the gym and that wasn't the first time like I ran into little shit because my record when
I got out I tried to be upfront and honest with people about it when I was being interviewed
and like immediately it's a no and you get like a hundred of them you know what I mean
which sucks.
Yeah for sure. So when you first started your channel what kind of people were you talking
to like what was your what was your sort of like direction you wanted to take it.
So I was gonna start I started telling my personal stories about prison and then I kind
of liked the interview format and I had been to prison with a bunch of people that I grew
up with so I started bringing people on that I was in prison with or in jail or in that
lifestyle and I just started interviewing and then the next thing I know it kind of
blew up.
Yeah there's a lot I'm sure there's a lot of fascinating stories in prisons.
Oh my gosh.
Just from the stuff that we've had on here we know that.
We're gonna get into some of them.
So let's go back to the beginning.

Back to the show.
Well I mean it kind of it goes back even before the charges that put me in really what what
put me into prison was fast money and I made that by you know exploiting like the opioid
epidemic that was going on in the town that I grew up in it was like the capital at that
time of like pill mills and pills and everything going on so I there's a lot of there was a
lot of money to be made then so that's what I would say was that Pasco County like right
down the street yeah I'm familiar I was selling weed I was in high school I was hanging out
with my best friend and we were trying to make money selling weed and doing just you
know like kid stuff I guess in high school and so we're doing that and his dad one day
came up to us and was like why are you guys selling weed there's no money in that y'all
should be doing this and he told us the whole scam about going to the doctor telling me
have anxiety lower back pain and there just happened to be a doctor in the county that
I grew up in he had an office in Newport Richie and in Hudson which what that was part of
his scam so you at that time I didn't have parents so I was on Medicaid and I would go
to his office and they would you know charge my Medicaid on a like Monday on the first
and then on the 15th I would go to his other office and do the same thing which you're
not supposed to be able to do that and he didn't care because my friend's dad hooked
it up with this doctor that we would just give him $500 and he would write us five
scripts of a hundred pills of our choice as long as they weren't like you know fentanyl
and shit like that but they were oxycodone is really what we wanted and this guy so
we entered a friend of yours introduced you to this doctor and this doctor knew that you
guys were buying me getting these scripts from him to sell in the street yeah bro he
knew he knew everything and it was my friend's dad he was like in a biker gang and all his
like buddies were doing this so that's how we got turned on to the doctor because he
was like y'all need to go here on Trouble Creek and 19 this is what you say and I like
he didn't even he acted like it was nothing bro it was like just sitting down with somebody
and then the next thing you know they're like okay and you're like Xanax you know oxy and
you're just naming off what you want so where that went bad um that kid that his dad introduced
us his name was Joe and one one day we had all this money and we were like bro let's
throw a hotel hotel party in Clearwater so he's like yeah yeah yeah so we're like getting ready
for this party and we had gotten scripts from that doctor and we had got everyone was asking for
like oxy cotton and that really wasn't a thing yet but the hardcore like pill users knew about it
because that's what got them you know the most the most high so we get oxy cotton 80s and we
didn't know at the time um how it worked with them like the coding it's time release so we didn't
know anything about that because we were young so that night it's me my friend Joe and the kid that
lived across the street from Joe Justin was in the car we go to the hotel party and they were like
they would pop pills every now and again and I wasn't into that then because they would get so messed
up I'd have to babysit them you know so I was like man I don't like this shit so we end up going to
the hotel party they both ate an 80 right and then like two hours had gone by we're at the party
and Joe was like man I don't even feel this this shit's weak right so he pops like a couple more
so does Justin a couple more yeah yeah like so now they're on three yeah so then the party's coming
to an end and like there was a fight that broke out so we're like man let's just leave here for the
cops come I drive Joe back to his house and drop him and Justin off I go home and then like the next
morning I'm not hearing anything usually like he'll text me and he's like bro come on come over let's
go and we'll go like so we eat and shit yeah so I didn't hear anything and then I'm like man I'm
just gonna drive over there and see what's up like we had hung out every day so that wasn't like
out of the ordinary or anything um and when I pulled down in street there was a ambulance there
was a bunch of cop cars I creep up to the house in the car I get out his mom's in the front yard
crying and I'm like what happened well that night Joe died and while I'm standing there and watching
this I see people coming out of the cross the street the kid Justin died too so they both died
that night it was fucking crazy man damn fucking yeah bro and you would think with me seeing that
like I would be like this life isn't for me you know what I mean like I don't know what it was
about me man I guess I was just like attracted to the chaos and the like the violence and all the
shit that came with it so I didn't stop at that point like I just kept going doing what we were
doing and eventually it took it went to another level because then the pill mills were really this
was like before the pill mills you know what I mean what year was this like 2001 bro like 10 years
of my life is like a blur honestly so I'm pretty bad yeah I'm pretty bad with like dates and stuff
but this was before the pill mills really hit like Tampa and you were hearing about it you know what I
mean this was it was probably like a year before it really hit and then there was like a problem
because they were you know there were so many people there were seven Floridians dying a day due
to opioid you know overdose right so how I it took to the next level for me was is you know once you
get in the game and you go to a doctor you meet some people at that doctors and then you start
selling them pills or you start buying their pills and the next thing you know they're like oh well
this doctor down the street will give you this many and there was no Florida database in effect so I
could literally go to like six doctors in one day as long as the time was there for me to do it like
within an eight hour period in the day I was sitting in the doctor's office because I was just like
going to multiple doctors and then when you meet those people and you're in that game there's a lot
of people that get their pills on the first and do them all so then they don't have any to get through
from like the 10th to the 30th so then that's when they would call me and be like hey bro I don't
got anything I'm going to be sick can I get this many for this many back when I get my shit filled
so if I give them a hundred pills that are you know let's just say ten dollars a piece thousand
bucks then when he goes to the doctor he gives me 200 back so it's one for two the deal right
and you have that with like one person and then the next thing you know you have like 15 people
like that and each one of them knows like two or three people that will need the same thing and
usually what it ended up happening was the people would go to the doctor they get their pills they
do them they call me for a front you know let's just say a hundred for two back and then they would
get those and do those too so by the time their doctor appointment came for the next month now
I'm paying for the whole visit I'm paying to fill the scripts and now they're giving me all their
pills and I would just like you know give them some so they wouldn't be sick basically to get
through the month or I would give them like methadone or some shit like that Christ what kind of
people are these where are you finding these people not people you would normally like chill with
you know what I mean are these just like straight out like trailer park hillbillies like other kind
of like people you see in like Appalachia kind of man it's like it's kind of like that but then
it started to be everybody man yeah because in the county I was in like it was nothing for you to
like go to a gas station and see somebody you went to high school with and next thing you know
you haven't seen them in five years and they're coming up to you and they're like yo bro what's
up you got those like everybody was doing it you know what I mean so it wasn't it was kind of like
all walks of life but yes it did start with like you know the backwoods hillbilly person right
and then eventually in the county like it was just like if you didn't do pills like you were like
the outcast you know what I mean right you were rare yeah it was it was nuts man wow so how long
did this how long did this last for you and how much look at what kind of money were you making
doing this so I mean the most I made in a month was probably like 50,000 doing it um but it was
more like five grand a week guaranteed no matter what and then it was a bunch of other things too
like I don't know if you know but when people get hooked on pills or drugs and you know they don't
have money they can't get any next thing you know they're giving you shit for it so I would end up
not only with the money but like tons of useless shit yeah like night vision goggles and whatever
bro like a broke toaster if you know what I mean yeah you could make a dollar on it it was they were
trading it right exactly wow so I'm so wild I know man it was it was a crazy life like because
I eventually I started taking the pills it's really like oh did you yeah really where it turns so
when I was 19 I was in Tampa I met this chick that was like 32 she was like a dentist assistant
or something and we were we moved to Ocala well she's going to a doctor already because she has
like anxiety and something else so she goes to this doctor and usually like back then if a doctor
would write you Xanax that means he would probably write you something more you know what I mean so
she started going to the doctor and asking him like you kind of had like a spiel you would say
you know like my back hurts right here it goes into my my ass cheek and I you know my legs hurt
because of it and there and you would get an MRI too which I was in a car accident later on and
broke my sternum so I had a legit MRI for my back so when we were in Ocala we kept having
a drive back to Tampa though to go to the doctors and I was just like man this drive like it's a
lot of money but why are we even living in Ocala you know what I mean like let's just move to Tampa
and we'll be close so we end up moving down here and that's really like when it started to get bad
and that was because like I was going to five doctors she was going to five doctors and then all
the other shit that went on that we were taking and buying people shit and after the car accident
I started to take pain pills like for pain you know what I mean I didn't like because you had been
right because you were actually physically in pain right and I didn't like them bro like when I
first started taking they made me nauseous I like it just wasn't my thing but I was in pain at the
same time and you know back then the doctors were giving you whatever so they had me on
shit that I probably shouldn't have been on that was more for like a cancer patient you know what
I mean right so he was just riding me a lot of shit and the next thing I know fast forward like
eight nine ten months later like my habit went from doing the prescription to now doing like
kind of like what happened to those people that I was selling with you know what I mean like I
just the tolerance bro like it just like went through the roof so and I mean I'm not proud of
this but like I was literally like taking like 30 to 40 pain pills a day plus like Xanax and you
know muscle relaxers and what else so that's really when it started to get bad and we had moved
into a condo in this like uh like kind of like apartment complex but it was like a condo area
and we had just moved in so we had no furniture so I mean I'm not super bad yet I can still sell
pills and do everything I need to to make money I was just like getting high for free at that point
because it was just so easy what's so great about mixing the painkillers like the oxycodones or whatever
it is with the muscle relaxers I feel like so many people do that I didn't like it I like the pain
pills in Xanax but I don't like the muscle relax you didn't like the muscle relax but it's a popular
it's like a popular thing right it was a popular people that people that are addicted to eat a lot
of those a lot of like whether whether they're Vicodins or oxys or whatever they are they usually
mix them with muscle relaxers yeah I know people that have done that the reason why I don't like
muscle relaxers is I was getting arrested one day and I had like 15 somas in my pocket somas that's
what they're called yeah yeah and I knew I was getting arrested like I could feel you know the
cop was gonna it was just a matter of time for he put the handcuffs on me and I had these pills
that I'm prescribed but they're out of the bottle so I'm kind of freaking out in my head like here's
a possession charge so I just ate all 15 of them oh man so by the time I get to the jail and they
like bring me up to the computer I was like foaming at the mouth because a muscle relaxer
like relaxes your muscles but your hearts are a muscle right right so I was literally like a wake
in my body looking at you through my eyes and knew what I wanted to say to you but I couldn't
make my mouth do it so I was like sitting there bro like helpful yeah bro it was so so that's why
I don't like muscle relaxers and and pain pills mixed together in Xanax I've had a few close calls
in my younger days with the like one time I had my wisdom teeth pulled out and I got prescribed
Vicodin and they gave me this giant bottle of Vicodin that's how they do it I remember one day
I mean back in those days I was like drinking and partying all the time and one night me me and a
couple of my buddies were we were drinking a lot of Jack Daniels and partying doing some other
substances and I ate like the last four Vicodins that I had in my prescription and boy did that
fuck me up I was paying for that for like the next two days I was fucked up bad because you didn't
you didn't have a tolerance no so you were you were high and sick at the same time yes bro I was
fucked up that was one of the last that was the last time I ever fucked with anything like that
I mean it was only because I got prescribed it I would have never had any desire for that stuff
right unless the doctor prescribed it to me yeah that's kind of how it was for me man like I didn't
it wasn't like I went out one day I was like man let me get some heroin because that's basically
what the pills are it's just the synthetic form and I didn't like it either when I did it man and
then like I don't know I guess it's because I had that gene in me or whatever I have like an
addictive personality and at that point like in my life like things weren't going great like they
were going great because I could pay my own bills make money and do all that stuff but like internally
like spiritually it wasn't going great like I hated who I was I hated the life I was living but
I just couldn't see it any other way at that point in my life it was like you know tunnel vision
and so when we moved to Tampa we went we were going to the doctors well we had just moved into
that condo I was telling you about and when the day like after we moved in I had to go take like
five people to the doctor so I go do all that I get like what they owe me I get my shit and I'm
on my way home I get home and there's this chick that's been hanging out I guess with my girlfriend
that lives like in the same place as us and so I had some people coming over so I was like
yo you need like who is this chick like get her out of here you know what I mean because I didn't
want her to see everything that was going on right so she tells uh she gets the keys and tells me
well I'm gonna go do laundry at the laundry mat and grab something to eat with her I'm gonna
bring her with me and I'm like all right whatever so my they leave my friends come over I do what I
have to do and then like probably an hour later they come back and like right when she walked in
the door I could tell something was off you know what I mean like it wasn't like you know when
something's off of your girl you know what I mean so I was like well I was asking her and she was
just playing it off like oh nothing nothing and then like five minutes later there's a knock at the
door so I'm like oh I'm thinking it's somebody like that needed more stuff or whatever and just
forgot it or something so I answered the door and when I answered the door was a cop and she's like
is so-and-so here and like it was a small condo so he can see her standing behind me in the living
room so when they were out at Chili's they left and they rear-ended someone at a stop light and then
took off didn't stay because I guess she had a suspended license and I didn't know it but she
knew it and that's why she took off and someone got her plate so they were there to arrest her
so they're taking her to jail I tell the girl like hey you gotta go I gotta bond her out I gotta
figure out all this so she leaves I call the bondsman they're like it's just a minor charge
she'll be released at like 6 a.m. so I took a bunch of Xanax and went to sleep so the next morning
I wake up to get ready to go get her I go out in my living room and the girl that I told to leave
is on the couch with like pills all over the coffee table pills on the ground and I'm the first thing
that went off in my head was like dude this chick's trying to rob me when I was asleep and took too
many pills and passed out or whatever so I go over to wake her up and right when I touch her to
wake up she starts going into convulsions and like flopping violently like on my couch so
I'm freaking out bro I'm there's so much shit in my apartment I got weed a safe full of shit
pills all over now I don't even know how that happened so as this is all going on and I'm trying
to pick up and put the drugs back in the right bottles there's a knock at my door so I'm like
wow she's convulsing yeah like seven o'clock in the morning man so I'm like I'm tripping so I'm
like fuck I go into the door and when I answer the door it was her grandma and she's like have you
seen so-and-so and I'm like move out of the way and she can look on my couch and and see her
granddaughter so I'm like oh my gosh she's like call 911 and I haven't put the pills in their
correct bottle so I'm like freaking out I don't want the cops there you know I don't want all this
shit to be under investigation right so I dial 511 on the phone and I'm like 911's not answering
to her grandma she's like what because I'm like paranoid so I'm just like man like I'm a good
dude you know what I mean I'm not like I was doing some shitty things in life but when it all comes
down to it like I have a good heart I'm a good person so I'm not gonna let this chick die on my
couch because I'm you know worried about getting arrested so I call 911 they all like I would say
10 or 11 cop cars came into the complex two ambulances she gets taken out in the ambulance
now the cops are in my house they're doing their thing they're picking up every pill that's not in
the right container and they're putting it in the bags by the pills so like Xanax oxycodone
shit like that and the cop the detectives are questioning me they already knew about me too
you know what I'm saying like I've already been pulled over by some of these cops and let go
because at that time you could have pills on you as long as they were prescribed to you so
there wasn't really shit legally they could do but they knew you know what I mean they knew what was
going on all right so so they knew what was going on and they they were like they wanted to get me
and this was just their perfect opportunity to not only be in front of me but in my house
where there's tons of shit going on right right so the detectives like they're they're being assholes
telling me I'm I'm screwed you're going to jail da da da which I already knew I was going to go to
jail but so as they're like talking all this shit they're like that girl just died in the ambulance
you're fucked and I was like what and like I was like in shock right so he arrests me he
arrests me on sales and delivery of Alpreza lamb trafficking oxycodone a delivery charge of some
other I think it was a muscle relaxer I forget and so the whole time I'm thinking this girl's
dead in the ambulance I go to jail when I get to the jail there's like cameras on me like the news
stations were there and so I knew like this was like serious man and I was freaking out so
I go to jail I can't she's still on life support at this she didn't die the cops are saying that
thinking I would like have a mental breakdown and tell them everything but there wasn't really
anything to tell them other than what had happened right but they had it in their mind I think that
they wanted to get me on every little thing and that's what they did at first they charged me with
like eight different charges and I'm in jail she's on life support I'm here talking to an attorney
telling me if she dies I'm going to get capital murder and all this crazy shit so she ends up
pulling out she she ends up living they take her off life support they question her and everything
I'm sitting in jail I bond out well all this is going on and she just disappears
like the she wouldn't show up to depositions she wouldn't come to court and say like she wouldn't
say anything and so she had moved and I forget where she moved but it was far away and kind of
just like detached herself from the whole thing because her family I guess you know didn't want
anything to do with it and so I fought this case like you know back and forth for like a year and
a half they were changing like this is how they would do it they would give you a trafficking
of oxycodone and then let you sit in jail until they could leak like by the statute formally charge
you with that and bring you to court and then right before that would happen they wouldn't
and then they change the charge from trafficking to sales so now they can keep you again if you're
in jail and you can't bond out or you don't have a bond on those charges because they're like
giving themselves enough time to to build their case basically even if they don't have one
they're gonna bluff and you know tell that you they do right and that's how the system works
man like that's and it works because they keep people in jail they know don't have the resources
to get out and then when they're in there for a while the first time they come at you with something
crazy like five years then you sit in for like three months then they're like oh you know 48 months
or four and a half years or whatever and they just keep doing that and they even if they don't have
a case they don't pull you out and say hey we're are bad you know what I'm saying right right like
they just they just that's what they do man and that's what they did to me and I you know I didn't
even want to plead guilty to anything like the sales charges or anything because they didn't
really have me on a sales charge you know what I'm saying they just thought but that's not enough
but then you know after sitting in there for a year they came in with five they came in with
like three and a half and they finally said 28 months no probation afterwards you'll be done
and I already had like so much time in so I was like all right so I took to 28 months and went to
prison in the state of Florida 28 months and you were in a state prison yeah I hear state
state prisons are way worse than the federal prisons I mean I haven't heard Jake we had Jake
in here and he was in he was in Florida state prisons for a long time and and this guy was in
for the same close to the same thing you were doing he except this guy like he robbed a pharmacy
and stole a bunch of oxys and he was in prison for like I think total close to seven years
in different places but he said that state prison especially in Florida was the worst experience
he ever had yeah it's bad like violence and just fucking lord of the flies type shit yeah yeah
the hills have eyes type shit yeah yeah yeah um the first time I went to prison man like I'm not
even gonna lie it wasn't that bad for me because you when you get to state prison you go to a
reception center and that's where the state decides how they're gonna classify you in the prison system
depending on you know your charges and everything so what everybody wants when they get to prison
is to be a permanent at a transit like at the the reception center because you can make a lot of
money because you got inmates coming in right and if you're a permanent you already have like
you know a line for cigarettes and and k2 is what they all smoke yeah whatever so when the
transits come in from jail a lot of them been sitting in jail for like eight nine ten months
sometimes more the first thing they want to do when they get to prison is get high or smoke cigarettes
or do all the shit they couldn't do in jail that now they can do in prison right so when I got there
I luckily became a permanent at the work camp which was in Orlando so and that's like an hour and a
half from where I was living and my girl is still going at that time was going to like you know five
doctors shoot me money in prison and then I found out through a guy that worked on outside grounds
they called it it's like a where you take care of the outside of the prison you go to like some other
places too so he was working out there and his girl lived actually in Pinellas right so he was
like bro we need to do something and I'm like what do you mean he's like bro we could be making
money in here this is the fucking lawn guy at the prison yeah yeah yeah so he was in my dorm
too we just happened to like get the same job and our both our girlfriends at that time lived in the
same county so I was like so he's like I can show you something and I'm like all right what's up so
we're on lunch one day and we're talking and he's telling me how he's getting pills in through
visitation right so I'm like okay I was like doesn't your girl live in Pinellas and he's like
yeah I was like my girl will pick her up and bring her Saturday to visit us if your girl shows my
girl what she's doing right so I could get them in so they you know she picks her up right I'm in
the visitation right and you when you go in you get strip searched before you even go in like the
girls when they're coming in they don't really get strip searched that you just have to like shake
your bra and like you know I think they take off their pants but leave their underwear on or something
like that so I change out I go in I say what's up to her we go over we buy some food we go out on
the picnic table and when I'm sitting on the picnic table she just slides over in a cellophane
like 10 blues a couple Xanax which a blue on the street at that time was like eight ten dollars but
it is a blue on oxycodone 30 oxycodone 30 is a blue yeah that's what they call blue boys
yeah is that true I haven't heard that one I've called I mean I've heard it called a bunch
things I'm sure they did though man yeah all right um yeah they're the like littlest blue pill man
and but they pack a punch really yeah you would not not think it you know what I mean until you
actually take it so what are those worth in prison I was getting 85 dollars for him but that was low
man like I could have probably gotten more um and you know they go more up north so pills down here
are like the cheapest at that time if I take that same pill to Kentucky and I sell it in Kentucky
it's a dollar a milligram wow so that I mean I ended up doing that too but we can get into that later
but the prison so where she slides me the pills I do what I gotta do bring them back to the dorm
and I sell a couple and the next thing I know like I got people from other dorms coming to me
like yo what's up with them things and da da da da da so I had met another dude that worked on an
outside grounds like place but it was in the city of Orlando and they had like a sweet ass officer
that used to like take him around to all their jobs so he he would let them go off and kind of do
what they wanted so I had the girl drive to that spot where this dude was working that was in my
dorm and drop off a lot more you know what I mean because he would bring him in so it was different
than me and visitation where I really right you know I didn't have anywhere to put him so it was
kind of this guy could just freely come into the prison and just well he would sneak him in he
there was a rear gate guy that worked the rear gate when you come in on the vans you got to get
stripped searched and shit but if you know the the guy at the gate they take the trash from the
chow hall down to the rear gate to let the like the guys come pick up the trash so he would use the
trash like he was wheeling down old trash right throw the old trash and then he would grab the
shit from the dude at the rear gate put it in the trash and bring it back into the prison oh wow yeah
that's probably too much detail I don't want to give anyone any ideas so I mean like the main thing
that I don't understand that I can't wrap my head around like the whole the whole thing is people
like you you're going to these doctors and you're getting all these pills but they're already so
readily available at the doctors like if you want them why can't you just go to another doctor and
get a prescription like it's it's amazing to me that there's such an underground market
such like an illegal market for these pills when they're so legally available like you mean back
then you could just go to a doctor and get them yeah because it feels like there's so many doctors
I mean Purdue Pharma was the one that was selling these to the doctors offices right
and they were incentivizing them to push them out as much as possible so if they're
so readily so readily available legally how is there such a big underground market for them
because not everybody could get them like it wasn't that easy like you had to have an MRI
that was legit which people make fake MRIs but you had to have an MRI and like there was so many
doctors but it was mostly like people at those doctors that go every month and they're like you
know every month patients so when you're a new person you're trying to go in first of all none
of these doctors accept anything but cash so you can't use a really nothing oh yeah yeah so a first
visit if they wanted to they could charge you eight hundred dollars like it's whatever they wanted
so that's what would keep people because they would be on pills and can't save up that much money to
go to the doctor and that's where like I or you know one of my friends would come in and they would
pay for them for everything so insurance wouldn't pay for any of this stuff no no I mean you could
if you were like older I think you I never had insurance pay for anything so when you go to the
pharmacy you're talking to the pharmacist like me and you are going out to buy weed on the street
they're like oh you want generic I'm like yeah whatever what's cheaper he's like well if you do
the generic I'll do him for a dollar 19 a piece if you get the you know there was it was like wow
yeah it was like a drug deal basically wow yeah that's insane man yeah and when you go to these
doctors man like you everybody knew what time it was like there's people you know shitting on
themselves because they're sick throwing up in the parking lot and there was a at a point where
I'm telling you about the Kentucky thing is that I met a lady who had a son that lived in Kentucky
so I started taking the pills up there to sell them for a dollar a milligram and well now how
much of a of a increase was that in your profit was like doubling your money or was it yeah no
it was like tripling it really yeah well depending because if I buy like you know
let's say I buy awesome when you turn the air down it's fucking hot
so if I if I say I buy a 500 pills off somebody that went to the doctor and I get a good deal on
him let's I mean we could just say let's say 10 a piece that's not a good deal but it's easy so
I buy all those pills for you know let's say five grand or whatever it is if I go up to
Kentucky now I'm making $30 a pill versus 10 so you're doubling your money on everything wow yeah
so it's like and they would charge more they were going for like 60 at one point up in Kentucky
and even down here they they went up but not like that what do you think is the biggest problem
with like the last 20 years with the opioid crisis and all the all the addiction all the people that
died and all the overdoses I mean it's really it's it's kind of it kind of clouds the whole argument
over legalize all drugs well yeah because you know what I mean because so with all the people that
were dying from from oxy oxys and and you know people doctors over prescribing all these painkillers
do you think it was because they weren't is it true that they weren't warning people that like hey
this is really addictive this is really dangerous or did these people know this already
uh they weren't weren't they weren't warning anyone yeah like I never had a doctor say hey
yo you could die from these they were just like well it was so I think what you knew right because
you knew you knew people personally that had died yeah like my two friends and then a countless
other people that have died from it but I think man that money money will money will change anybody
man like you can and these are people that never were gonna have money in life and now all of a
sudden they're making 20 grand a month so whoever sees whoever they know that knows them is gonna
see that and then they're gonna want to turn around and do the same thing and I think that's
just what happened is so many people got like hooked on the game and got into the game and
everything with the pills and it just like I don't think anybody saw it coming you know what I mean
like how powerful the pills are because they I mean it's like crack man like they have that much
power except maybe even more because when you don't have crack like you can get through that if you
don't have pills like you're dope sick which is like the flu times you know 20 for like you know
seven to ten days depending on like what your tolerance goes yeah yeah I mean obviously yeah
the right approach would be to tell somebody if they're gonna if you're gonna give if you're a
doctor and you're prescribing these people you gotta be like look this is what's gonna happen if
you take too many if you take this many and you get you're gonna get a high chance you're gonna get
addicted to it and if you get addicted to it this is what's gonna happen you're gonna feel like
fucking death for 10 days after that would probably you know you might take a little bit longer to
make your decision if that was okay yeah right but I think it affected those doctors the same way
with all the money I mean they're making oh exponential amount of money just prescribing
pills legally as many as they want to everybody you know and a lot of those doctors ended up
going to prison as well yeah they did it's funny that you bring that up because I remember there
was this doctor that was giving me like 330s 480 oxy crazy yeah so we're in the office one day and
he's like you know he's writing me on my scripts talking to me like he was a he was a character
man so he hands the nurse the script she goes out to copy them he walks out of the room I walk
out of the room he goes in his office by the before I could walk through past his office in the hallway
he was like hey come here so I'm like all right so I go in this dude's office he has like three
monitors set up on his desk and this was before that was a thing you know what I mean just because
he was making so much money yeah they're falling yeah crazy he's doing stocks on one monitor and
even better bro I go in the office and he's like yo check this out and he moves the mouse to
you know make the screens pop and there's three screens filled with mail order brides from three
different countries and he's like what do you think of this one she's fine huh nice so the guys
and the guys ordering brides he's got an MRI machine in the parking lot in a van so that way when
people come to him and they don't have their MRI he sends them downstairs they go into this van a guy
will take an MRI off a 60 year old that has you know back hit problems and copy it on to the 20 year
old that just went out in the van and then he turns around goes back up and sees the doctor and gets
the pills wow and then the doctor refers you to his friend who's the pharmacist or they're in
house yeah or they'll literally have their own pharmacy at the doctor so he probably has a Ferrari
parked out back oh yeah like yeah bro I mean they were busting doctors with like yachts and
yeah and money over shores and shit they were I mean if you think about it if we if us three went
to the doctor right it's a hundred dollars a visit after you pay for the initial visit they
booked their patients at eight patients can fit into one hour right so it's like every 10 minutes
or not less than that even yeah like I forget what it is but like eight an hour there's like
six so 64 patients in a day at a hundred dollars a pop cash cash money so it ain't on nothing that's
just for the appointments just for the appointments yeah and and then they would you know they'd
hit you with other shit too like I mean some of them were corrupt so they would be like today it's
200 if you don't have it you don't have it you're not getting seen yeah and when you're in that
shit and you got five people in the car in the parking lot waiting on you you know what I mean so
do you remember the story from the uh the HBO documentary where there's the guy in Florida
and one of the sales reps from Purdue pharma went down to meet her meet him and uh they basically
wanted to like test their new their new pills and and you know they were they kept trying to figure
out how they're going to make more money how they're going to you know at this point they're
making like three billion dollars a year so they find this guy who's been in like a crazy car accident
had crazy like spinal surgery and he had like a super high tolerance so this this sales rep went
down to go meet this guy and like uh I think it was Naples Florida and uh all right and uh yeah yeah
yeah and they started giving him like uh the 30 milligrams like okay take 20 30 milligram tablets
a day like a lab rat yeah kind of like a lab rat and they were giving them for free she didn't
like met him in the parking lot of the uh of the the clinic see that that's that's how I don't doubt
that though one bit man and he's like yeah hell yeah I'll do it he's like I'll take this stuff yeah
it's called oxy content okay sure I'll try it then he's like this is not doing anything for me like
okay they will give him 50 milligrams started giving him 20 50 milligram tablets a day still not doing
anything so they up them to like 100 milligram tablets take 20 a day and after everything there's
they give him the they give him the biggest dose they ever created which was 160 milligram tablets
I've seen those and he's like I'm eating they told me to take two that's great take 25 tablets
twice a day of 160 milligram tablet he's like it took me 15 minutes to take all the pills to eat
these pills he's like it was like eating a giant bowl of Cheerios he's like it it was took 30 minutes
total to eat 50 pills a day that's crazy I can't believe he lived to tell that story and he's on
the documentary just talking about it so fucking crazy he just reminds me of like so many different
Florida men that we've run into yeah that's what I'm saying like down here it seemed like it was
worse than like we were the last state to get the database if that tells you anything yeah that's
because what is the database so the database is if me and you go to doctor you know Bob on Monday
we can't turn around within that 30 day period and go to another doctor and get narcotics prescribed
especially not the same ones and if you do when you go to the pharmacy and they put your name
into the database if they see that you bend it to you're automatically red flagged in the system
and you can't fill anything else and usually they're calling the DEA after that too okay
that's why I that's where it all came to an end for me man when I was in prison selling the pills
doing the shit in there and the like what prison I landed at was it was like a sweet camp so
there wasn't like there was violence and shit but not to like a crazy level to where you're like
all right like this is real in the battlefield but so I got out of prison that time I go back
I'm living with the same chick when I that I went in with and she's been going to multiple doctors
and it was like a month I had been out I think and we end up going to one of her doctors we go upstairs
go to the doctor go downstairs to the pharmacy she hands in the stuff and like 10 minutes later
he comes back and he's like you went to this doctor this doctor and he had all her shit
so it was like at that point where I was like yo what the fuck am I gonna do because I had been
planning on doing this like the rest of my life really yeah like because of the money and then you
know I became addicted to them so I was like well I'll just keep selling them make the ones I take
for free and then just make a little money and I mean not a not a little it was a lot at first
like it was a lot of money at first actually um but later on like when the pill mills were getting
busted the price of pills was going up on the street because the price to fill them in the
pharmacy was going up I mean it got to like six dollars a pill one time in the pharmacy which
that's like street prices back a year before that you know what I mean yeah so um it was at that
point where I was like I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do so obviously I saw one doctor still
and kept getting my scripts from them filling them selling them keeping some you know dealing other
drugs now and then it was like just to the point where like I didn't give a fuck you know what I mean
like I didn't give a like at first I was selling the pills and doing shit like that but it got to
the point where like nobody wanted to hang out with me because I was just like I was just jack
boi and people shit like I'd be like oh you want 100 pills yeah all right meet me at 7-eleven and
then they get in the car and I'd fucking yoke them up and pass them out and then push them out the
door grab all their shit and keep going oh shit yeah that was one time I did that to a kid out of
doctors too bro after he got his shit he says yeah so it became like like savage mentality and that
and this was all due to you know me being in the car wreck then starting to take a little and that's
how quick man it like I didn't even notice when like it went from a problem you know what for him
went from making money to a problem like me personally I could see it in everybody else and
I could be like oh he's fucked up oh she's wasted or whatever and watch other people's life like go
down the shambles but I wasn't seeing it in my own life at that point so I just kept selling drugs
robbing people you know doing anything to make money on the street and then finally I got hit
again with like a grand theft and like three new sales sales charges I got the grand theft
because I fronted a chick like so many pills to go down to Miami she was doing like some photoshoot
and sell them and then come back and bring me the money well when she came back she didn't have the
money or the pills so I was in her apartment I'm just like look when you pay me you'll get your
shit back and I reached over and grabbed like a Movado watch and some some type of camera I didn't
know anything about cameras then yeah so I go home within 10 hours the cops are at my house she
called the cops and said I just took the shit nothing about you know Mio and her her own me money
none of that so I go to jail I bond out on those charges so then I'm at this house like selling
all night I go to leave and I guess like it was a known like house so cops were down the road
waiting for people to leave and they got me with the three sales charges because they were in bags
and shit oh and they got me yeah and and I had cocaine on me too I think crack cocaine
so then I go to jail now I can't bond out because I was already out on a bond and when you catch
new charges they pull all your bonds so you can't get out until you go to court and see the judge
and he decides like you know what he's gonna do with it right so I sat in jail I got the same
attorney I did the first time and this time like they came at three like two and a half and then I
took 18 months when I went to prison this time though it was a lot different so I went to their
same reception center and I'm like yeah this is gonna be sweet I'm just gonna stay here one night
they come over kick my bunk and they tell me I'm you know I'm being transferred to one of the 160
prisons in the state of Florida so at you never wanted 160 prisons in Florida I mean I don't
know if that's the exact number but it's over it's like 130 150 somewhere around there can you find
that that's fucking crazy yeah well they're working is there even that many counties in Florida I mean
there's I think there's like counties with they're well Sumter right up the road has like Coleman fed
Sumter prison the jit camp 143 facilities statewide yeah I knew it was up there 50 correctional
institutions seven private partner facilities 16 annexes and 33 work camps three reentry centers
12 fdc operated work release centers 18 private work release centers two road prisons one forestry
camp and one basic training camp Jesus Christ they got it all the smorgasbord that just says
something to you though that's an industry like bro we're like that's insane I know man tell me about
it so I mean that that's kind of right Florida is not like when you look anything up on prison
about like you know in Florida none of their shits correct so they have all those camps
but usually at every camp there's a main unit and there's an annex and there's a work camp
so the main unit in the annex will hold any type of prisoner you're you know someone that killed
50 people or you can be in there for you know two ounces of weed like there's no like system in
Florida to where like okay they're murderers I'm gonna keep away like the drug addicts or the you
know right away from them it's not like that so you like literally the when I was in the reception
center the dude that was my bunkie had a life sentence and he was like 23 so they'll put he had
life sentence for armed home invasion and he had just got out of prison and then committed an armed
home invasion yeah so I mean not too bright but and then in Florida they have prr so when you get
released from prison if within three years you commit like aggravated battery burglary I think of
an occupied there's certain charges right they can give you a day for day what that charge carries
so if you get out and commit a second-degree felony that's prr now a second-degree felony
usually carries 10 years in prison 10 to 15 I think so now you're getting that with no
gain time nothing and there's no way around it because it's a lot damn bro what is this
prr in Florida yeah so second-degree 15 get five for a third that's insane man
and there's a lot of people in prison bro that are doing like 30 years because of that law right
there and it wasn't it was like you know where most of the people that you met in there in there for
drugs I would say 90% of the people 90% yeah are in there because they were doing drugs selling
drugs or you know we're caught up in some time mostly pills I mean yeah pills were big I think
more at that time in like the white white trash the you know white suburban that was really where
the pills like really started to like you know destroy that community and then I think over time
they you know in the ghetto started getting them because back then you know you didn't go to the
the ghetto to buy pills or the hood or whatever you want to call it right you know you would go to
a fucking math house in Intersbruck and his dad would have a script yeah that's how it kind of went
for a while and then the next thing you know like it just was everywhere man like there was like
yeah man it was great like watching that documentary and seeing all the fucked up people
like all like the fucking the picture those two people the parents in their car like slumped over
passed out I saw that kid is awake in the car seat in the back like that's fucking Christ like this
isn't a very good argument for legalize all drugs no I was like whoa how the fuck does this work
right but those were legal drugs that's what I'm saying yeah they were perfectly that's the fucked
up part and that's what they were doing right you know what I mean usually it's when they make drugs
illegal and there's a whole underground you know illegal right fucking market for them with cartels
and whatever it is that's usually how the bad shit happens and this is completely legal there's
these are doctors that are giving people all these drugs and this is what's happening yeah all for
money man you saw it was all about money yeah Purdue was like literally lying like they weren't
even telling oh yeah like they were passing like you know they'd have to go get this drug tested
they're paying off the dude tested them and we don't know the long-term effects and now you see
it you know what I mean yeah we're you know 10 15 years later and usually somebody you know
is either an addict or they know an addict and it and it's just they're everywhere man the one of
the crazy things about that whole Purdue thing was in 2007 I think it was when they had to pay
their first settlement and it was like 30 million bucks I think they had to pay it's nothing and they
were making like three billion three three billion dollars a year they had like their their record year
after right after that and that's crazy that's when when that happened that sparked all those other
companies to start up and start doing the same thing because they're like they're like holy shit
they just got away with this yeah we're gonna go do the same thing are you kidding me I'll pay 30
million for every billion no problem that's more than selling the pills I mean you are the you're
the connect at that point right so you make the prices it Purdue man there was a time when they were
like getting under investigation and they were starting to get like maybe it was around the 2007
I can't remember but you could literally like your doctor would mail your scripts and then they would
send you the pills in the mail and they were like not generic they were the real one so you
can make more money and they would just like show up in your mailbox like it was literally like
Amazon but with pills you know my god dude it was nuts and that like what he was saying man
they're legal so I was getting pulled over fucked up driving had pills all on me passengers had pills
the cops knew what was going on but they just couldn't do anything prescription right it's got
your name on it and then they they started to like get hip to that they started to see that so then
you would get pulled over and they were able to count your pills so if you got them on Monday
there should be this many in here and that's kind of what they went to but with the town I was in
man the sheriff the whole like police department the mayor of the town that I grew up in is sitting
in prison right now because he was selling crack and doing meth and heroin and all this shit and
the cops raided his house and he fired off a gun so now he's in prison that was the mayor of the
town I grew up in so if that who was he um I forget is I did an episode Ocala no uh Newport Richie
oh Newport Richie okay yeah he was all on the news and shit but he's like he was a drug act he was
selling drugs and he was doing prostitutes Jesus Christ yeah it's crazy this dude was a fucking
being a real Florida mayor we should look at it we should look that guy up that's insane I'll forget
his name I'll figure it out by the time we're done but yeah I mean the I mean they were getting away
with I mean the government let them they gave them the fucking the green light to do it by by making
them get away with a 30 million dollar settlement yeah well you gotta think man that those companies
like Purdue and you know whatever I forget all the other ones but they're paying for politicians
campaigns right they're backing campaigns with tens and hundreds of millions of dollars that's why
Rick Scott was the right he was the what governor something yeah yeah governor yeah and he wouldn't
pass the database yeah because he's probably got someone on the phone with him back in the back
saying if you pass this shit you're done because there's billions bro and there's money and there's
no there's no makes no sense to not have that database in Florida when they got it everywhere
else when like why why would you hey we don't want that here exactly but why so I think the company he
he was partnered into paid out like the biggest pharmaceutical settlement of all time Purdue
paid out the biggest right they just paid Billy and they just what happened to Purdue what's the I
don't even know what maybe he was part of Purdue they shut Purdue down I know they shut it down
right this was recently yeah it was because of deaths I think it wasn't because like there was a
medical thing it was it was because people were dying like our like I was saying like eight
Floridians I I mean you could probably look it up at eight Floridians a day were dying
due to overdose of opiates and then I wonder what happened to the guys who own Purdue the two guys
what was their last name they have their names are on like the most prestigious museums in New York
yeah that's what's got me bro imagine how many bodies those dude have right like selling those
pills and killing people yeah and then they have a fucking monument oh yeah they've they've
fucking donated money to these museums and they have their names inscribed in some of the most
like infamous museums around the around the country well that just shows you where our country's at
you know what I mean like reward I wonder where those guys are now I don't know but they're probably
on a fucking island somewhere with a boatload of money you know they like they're hanging out with
the CEO at Enron yeah they probably had so many people like Epstein did that they could just like
freaking you know oh you didn't know about this like so they probably had so much dirt on people
and again an addition with that is the FDA they they the people that worked for the FDA
ended up a year later working for them they had people that were FDA employees that they hired
to work for Purdue oh yeah yeah to approve their shit right to approve shit yeah that's yeah that's
crazy man so I just saw something recently too um I forget where I saw somewhere on Twitter I think
I might have saved a screenshot of it somewhere but it was saying that currently 75% of the FDA's
review budget is paid for by like Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson right that's kind of creepy dude
like that's insane yeah bro that is that is definitely insane I gotta find that's 75 yeah
I think that was it let me find it right now I know that Florida or maybe it was the United States
as a whole but had the most like opioid prescriptions prescribed I think it was Florida we had the most
yeah so they were literally just like giving the shit out yeah bro it's fucking insane that's
what Purdue did man it said we're not gonna tell you about it we're just gonna give you this pill
and it literally would make your pain go away and oh yeah feel good but not knowing the whole time
like right you're gonna get addicted claws into here it is biopharmaceutical industry the buy the
whole biopharmaceutical industry provides 75 75% of the FDA's drug review budget that's posted in Forbes
by John La Matina that's corruption right there bro it doesn't get much like noticeable than that
but YouTube yesterday or today or yesterday they announced that they uh they're come they're they
used to uh like suppress videos that talked about like misinformation like about the vaccine if you
talk about the vaccine or say talk about like any kind of bad side effects now they'll delete the
videos they used to shadow ban it now now as of today they said they're going to start deleting
all those videos yeah if you talk about like covid or certain topics yeah so this video will
probably be deleted by next time damn don't talk bad about the FDA all right um so yeah man it just
like it it got bad for a minute you know what I mean and I ended up getting sentenced to prison
again and like I was saying like I ended up going when I was in the chow hall at the at the um the
reception center the officers are all walking back and forth with files because there's a bunch of
bluebird buses lined up ready to take us to one of our you know glorious destinations in Florida
so when we're in there I'm like yo sarge where are we going because I'm like you know what camps
like we call them camps in Florida they're not like you know people watch you probably think
like day camp or some shit right but these are violent places they're just happen to be called
camps so you know you hear about when you're in the reception when you're in jail because people
will be coming back from prison or you'll just hear it like on the wire like oh this prison's
sweet you can do this and this so there's always like three prisons that are sweet in the state of
Florida so when everybody's waiting to go there they're always like man I hope I'm going here I
hope I'm going there so we're in the chow hall and I'm like yo sarge where are we going and
we're all sitting down on the table he's like you don't want to know where you're going I was like
like where am I going like what I don't understand what do you mean he's like you're going to the
gulf which is like the gulf yeah they call it the gulf it's a golf correctional it's it's a violent
camp man so I I didn't know like how bad it was when he said that I figured oh he's just trying to
like boo me up and scare me and shit so we we drive like eight I forget how long it took but
we get to the prison up in the panhandle like close to Georgia Alabama area and we get off the
bus like four or five redneck hillbilly fat obese the women look like dudes you know you could put
three teeth you know between the five of them to make a you know and they come over and they
we're all standing in line and they say welcome to we while hitchka Florida and we go and hit you
and then they just like started screaming in our face like get your shit get to the
fucking like it's like a boot camp they run Florida like a military kind of in prison so
they're all with uh in your face like oh you want to I fuck me motherfucker like right in your face
looking at you and that's really like well first when he's when they said that I was like yo where
the fuck am I at I felt like I was in what did he say what what did he say it was there was a
town called we were hitchka yeah the the prison's in a town called we while hitchka we while hitchka
yeah okay so he said welcome to we while hitchka and we go and hit you meaning like we're gonna beat
your ass like whenever we get the chance and they weren't lying about that they should put that on
the sign when you pull when you drive through the road right well there was supposedly like
all these like rumors like the KKK a lot of the officers were KKK sure they are yeah and that's
like pretty known in Florida yeah because there was actually dudes that got busted two guards that
were announced like they were KKK members really and you see like you don't feel it man like for me
to tell you like like you could hear a mouse piss on cotton that's how like high your nerves were
when you were in there like because you just didn't know like what was gonna happen like
when I called home for the first time you know I only have my grandparents I don't have any other
family and well she passed away but she's alive at this time and I call because I just got to
the camp I know I'm gonna be at I know I'm gonna be here so I'm like all right let me order my
winter clothes like my packages and everything so they're trying to figure out how to do the packages
and I'm like I'm at I'm at golf correctional so she's doing the stuff online I call back like
probably an hour later and she's like are you gonna be okay I just googled it yeah I just googled it
and there's 75% murderers and and you know like Florida puts everybody together people think it's
like California in Florida you can be in the cell with the chomo with meaning you know what I mean
chomoluster yeah so I mean obviously if you're a stand-up dude you're gonna you know you're not
gonna sleep in the same cell you're gonna either smack them or something's gonna happen but what
I'm getting at is Florida is like a cesspool man they literally just put everybody with everybody
so you have you know Aryan brotherhood unforgiving crypts GD's bloods all in the same like dorm
with 120 people so I mean they're they literally like don't care first off or they wouldn't do that
and you don't have to really worry so I didn't really have to worry so much about the inmates
after I'd been there for a little while it was the guards that like you really had to like worry
about and I didn't find how about how serious that was until I went to confinement and I was only at
golf for like I think three weeks before I ended up in confinement so when I got there they put me
an m dorm m dorm has a one and a two so you can go in one side like a and a b right and they have
like I forget a hundred inmates I think in each one so I get put into m2 I'm in there and they move
this dude in right he as he comes in there's three officers with him so I don't know any of this at
this time but apparently this dude had been at that at the main unit remember how I said there
was like an annex in a main unit well he was at the main I was at the annex now they're bringing
him over to the annex because he got into a relationship with one of the female officers right
and she I guess was like obsessed with him or she fell hard for him you know what I mean but the
dude was a booty bandit what is that so in prison you have dudes that are labeled like booty bandits
and that's literally from the time they wake up to the time they go to sleep they're they're hunting
ass like who they're gonna fuck bro like like they're looking for people they can finesse
meaning like like I mean I don't know how they do it but I know how other people get finessed and
that would be like you know I come into a dorm he would come up to me and be like hey bro my cousin
knew your cousin on the street and he robbed them and now dude's gonna have his whole gang beat your
ass so then he would turn around but at the same time and be like listen man you know I'm gonna take
care of it but you know I'm gonna need something for that and then that turns into two suits and
then a month later he's getting his whole fucking order and the kid just doesn't even know because
he just wants to stay alive oh my god so I this guy he gets brought into the dorm but all the
officers they bring him up to the officer station this is my luck right I'm in the corner bunk on
the wall it's an open bay dorm with bunk beds on the on the outer and then single bunks in the
middle so I'm on the wall back oh shit I'm on the wall back to the camera good I mean you're good
man it's all right which one did you hit I think I just went like that I don't I don't think you
touched it this should be good okay so he gets into the dorm I'm sleeping in the corner bunk right
yeah they move him in the bunk next to me like on the other side and the other aisle so they move
he comes in he goes to the officer they assign him the bunk I can already tell like I'm pretty good
at like reading people to see if like you know I can pretty much tell if I'm gonna like you or not
I mean I think everyone's kind of like that but in there that sense on me was like turned up really
high because you don't want to open the door to people like you know because then once that door
is open it's hard to close it hence the kid that you know started with a soup and now he's given
his order right because a lot of people in there don't get money so they're gonna I'll get into
that later but okay so this guy I looked at him and I instantly knew like I'm not gonna like this
dude just the way like his mannerisms were he was really like loud and disrespectful and I don't
like that like I don't like big mouths you know what I mean so they move them next to my bunk
um you know I go about my day I'm in the day room I think I was working out or doing something
and I came back around the corner and the officers were there this dude had left the dorm I think to
go like to classification or something they you get a box in prison they call it a footlocker it
sits on the ground where you put all your personal property in it and as I'm turning the corner they
got this dude's box and dumped all his legal paperwork I mean the dude had been down for like
15 years so he's accumulated a lot of shit when he's been in there excuse me so when I come around
the corner they're dumping all this shits dude all this stuff's dude all this shit in the fucking dorm
and they just whip out and start pissing all over his shit in the middle of the dorm like three
officers so I was like oh man this is bad he just moved in next to me all the officers don't like
so I know like my little area where I'm living is going to be hot because they're always going
to be over there fucking with that dude so when he got in the relationship with the woman officer
at the main unit she caught feelings I guess what is it what was this dude what do you look like
he was a black dude he was probably like uh five ten like two fifty so a big dude big jack dude
I mean he was not not super tall five ten but yeah he wasn't jacked he was just like big bone you
know okay okay so not like a super intimidating like Debo looking kind of guy yeah I mean not
intimidating the only thing like that where I was having like second thoughts is he had like
like 29 years he had already been down 15 so like usually those dudes like aren't fighting
they're stabbing shit so that's really like when I saw him I was like man I know I'm not
gonna like this dude but I'm gonna try to just because like he's he lives next to me but once
I saw why wouldn't now why wouldn't he why wouldn't he fight and he why would he stab instead of fight
because they're not it's that it's that type of violence like they're right and he's been in there
a long time he's over fighting people probably right he's fucking doing 30 years and yeah that
that too but even young people man that come in like that's the new thing in prison like there's
not any fighting if you're gonna fight man you're there's gonna be a knife at some point okay it's
just Florida's crazy man then you I mean there's a lot of shit that goes on but I'll get into that
in a minute um so they're pissing on his shit I see this I know off rip I'm not gonna like this
dude right so time went on and they moved like there's a difference between a gay guy and a booty
bandit right okay so in there like you're not like me I didn't talk to any of them because I don't
want to be labeled that and when you're talking to them somebody sees that and they're like oh man
that white boy likes it like that you know what I mean so I don't I didn't fuck with them when I was
in there but in prison you have gay dudes that are like feminine like paint their nails and put
Skittle like for blushing shit they moved one of those into the dorm and when they do that man
like you'll be in a dorm and like we'll all be hanging out playing poker playing cards and
everyone will be like oh all convict shit but then when one of those dudes get moved into the dorm
all of a sudden that tough guy gangster tatted up is like over on the dude's bunk sitting down
having long talks with them and there's literally like five dudes that are trying to do this because
they're trying to get her they call it a her in there right and you watch this go on well my
bunkie the booty bandit you already know like he's already on that so he's loving this so he's now
on the bunk trying to get with the punk and they would wake up on saturday morning this is kind
of where it started with that me fighting that dude so he was bringing his friends over to his
bunk and they were all chilling talking about oh they would be like he ain't gonna get her i'm
gonna get her and they would like talk about like how they're gonna finesse the gay dude to give it
up right so on saturday they would all wake up like four or five of them and they would sat on
saturdays they give you coffee cake in prison right so they would all go to the chow hall
to get the coffee cake not eat it bring it back and see who could get it to the punk first because
then they would think like they won something it was like on that type of level like predator type
shit oh my god so they're doing this i'm watching all his friends talk about it and like when you're
on your bunk and like you're trying to just like escape from everybody and now i got like the gay boy
gangsters over here like talking about how they're gonna you know get this punk oh my god dude that's
really like where i was like this is gonna happen because he was already disrespecting me from having
that shit going on where i'm trying to sleep and the fact of just how he is so it was like
but what what it did what did do it was we were in uh we were in master roster count they come in
and you have to sit up on your bunk and read off your dc number as they walk through the dorm
every inmates and they're counting so when they get done counting the dorm they'll say relax and you
can lay back on your bunk and kind of hang out for like 10 minutes until the cap uh telehassie
will clear count right so then we can all get up and do everything so there was this lady that worked
the dorm and like in there there's gunners i don't know if your audience or you knows what that is
so a gunner is if they move a female officer into the officer station and she's in there and she
works night shift the lights in prison are out when i was in i think 10 or 11 i forget that
oh no this is when the guys like they wait for the woman to walk by and they start jacking off
yeah oh my yeah or like they do it any which way like you literally will get up at 10 or 11 when
the lights are out and you'll go to the water fountain in the day room and dude is literally
the water fountain's like right here and the officer station's like right here so he's just
standing there with his shit out jacking his dick to her and she's just sitting there watching it
and likes it that like some of them like it it's freaking crazy but a lot of them don't and that's
where you get that you can get charged and shit for that they you go to confinement and all that
shit and they torture you so but so this dude right he has all these like punks going on over
near my bunk and finally we're in master roster that night and that this officer they all like
to gun down when she worked was working so instead of waiting until we clear count i had rolled over
to face the wall to take a nap right like during the 10 minute like a little cat nap so i hear like
commotion like laughing and all this shit going on so i roll back over and this dude's literally on the
butt ass naked jacking his dick while we're all sitting in master roster he's gunning the lady
through the window at the officer station like she's not even looking at him like she's like
turned around and he's just like oh she's a neater dog she's fitting to get it and then he would just
start so i roll over and wake up to this so which is really like disrespectful you know to do to
somebody in prison and so i didn't say anything i just put my shoes on stood up and we just i just
took off on and we started fighting and we were fighting for like a minute a good minute and in
there like a minute's a pretty long fight you know and really anywhere was he fighting back
yeah yeah we were fighting this naked guy with a boner well he had his boxers on okay but i think
they ended up fucking because we were on the ground like fighting and like it ended up going to the
ground that's when we got sprayed by the mace so they all come in they handcuffed us they take us
to the shower we have mace and shit he's lumped up right bleeding out of his eye so they take him
to medical to like get stitched up and shit and they're taking me to confinement they just literally
just walk you from whatever dorm you're in across the compound there's a confinement wing where the
all the people go to the box and so the warden happened to be making rounds on the prison that
night as i'm walking out you know i'm fucking got his blood on me i got mace which is another thing
you don't want to fight like booty bandits or people like that because a lot of them have aides
so oh that's why a lot of people don't like do shit to them you want to get their blood on you
yeah you don't want to get that that antibody karate so so i'm walking across the compound the
warden is like doing his run walks through the compound of shit and he comes over to the two
officers that are walking me you know my hands behind my back and he's like and he and so he's
like what happened and i was like fucking pissed because now i know i'm going to the box you know
it's winter i'm gonna be fucking cold so i was like dude listen the dude was gunning next to me and
i'm not i'm not living like that i don't respect that so i did what i had to do and he's like are
you a b like thinking i was an arian brother or some shit oh so i was like no man i'm a neutron
like i'm solo and he's like all right so he you could tell like they were like that's what's up
you see what i'm saying like the warden kind of like you're hearing them be like yeah bro
he got him decent like they knew this dude so and everybody knew him so when he was a problem
he was like a constant problem yeah and like everybody knew about that fight because everybody
knew of him and how he was and then nobody really knew of me it was just like the white boy that beat
dirt's ass you know what i mean so we get i get into confinement i'm in my cell and they bring him
from medical into the confinement wing and right when he gets in like the officers i guess had like
said some shit to other inmates or whatever and so that when he walks in they're like oh you let that
white boy beat your ass so now they're like booing the whole situation up again so i'm like man like
i'm gonna do you know 50 60 days in the box i think it's 30 and i sat in there for a little while
to wait and go to dr court but now i'm gonna get out and i'm gonna have to go right back in because
there's no way this dude is gonna let this be known you know what i mean like you know he's gonna
fight you again or try to stab you or something yeah and so i did i think i did like i forget how
many days but i was back in confinement and that is when i saw how the officers really are and like
when i saw that is really when i was like i laid down that night after all that shit had happened
what they did and i was just like bro like i could not go home and it doesn't have to be like a gang
thing or anything like that like they were literally killing people there like it's in the it's in the
paper and everything just instigating situations and shit they well yeah well they would definitely
do that but what they did was they targeted the gunners so when you go to confinement and you go
for gunning they put a one dash nine on your door and they do that for like each charge and they have
your charges when you're being released your picture is all on your door right the two like
two cellies got the pictures on it so like they would see the one dash nine on the dude's door
and they would like instigate him and talk shit and be like you know that officers would do that
and sell them out and then one day like there was a there's a captain in florida who's usually in
charge of like 10 officers or i don't know but they're like the upper dudes in the system right
they wear a white shirt so he i guess the gunner had said something to one of the officers when
they were messing with him right and the captain came in and he literally just walked in the middle
of the dorm and there's all cells going down here and then there's a top tier where they go up top
so there's two levels and he stood in the middle of the dorm at first he told us all to get off
our windows and then he just said if y'all want a gun my white women get your ass on the door
like he was begging somebody to like say fuck you sar or fuck you cap you know what i'm saying
and there's always one motherfucker in there that'll be that dude like no matter what so this dude was
like fuck you da da da da da and he starts selling them out through the door right so the captain and
like three officers go over to this dude's cell now they open his flap he's still talking shit and
they they're supposed to turn on a like back then it was a handheld camcorder and they when an
inmate was bucking they call it bucking like when you're kicking the door screaming so they would
turn the camera on and they would have to record what was going down as they extracted the inmate
from the cell to make sure like you know they didn't break the law which right so what they do is they
would literally have the camera the camera guy would be behind two other officers they go over
to the door with the camera off talk a bunch of shit to this inmate get them going crazy and then
boom they turn the camera on they're like inmate stop bucking stop like like they make it seem like
he just started to go crazy for no fucking reason and they're trying to get him to calm down
so they sprayed this dude through the food flap with black jesus is what it was back then i think
they took it out but it was like a strong ass oc spray that like if we sprayed it in the front
parking lot or like 50 yards away like we would be like choking that's how powerful it was like we
in confinement it would come through the vents in the cell so a dude upstairs got sprayed the air
the the return vent would bring it into all the other cells so you're literally like 10 cells away
and you have to take your shirt off and you wet it a little bit and you like mask your face to kind
of stop from the shake it in your nose jesus so this dude's in the cell they're after they spray
you they're supposed to take you out and put you in a shower because that shit's that powerful like
it needs to it needs to get off you so they didn't do that with him and they just left him in there
for like an hour and that that stuff not only gets on your eyes it gets on anything it touches so
like your hands will be burning just from getting the like you know the residue on you
and he was literally like screaming for his mom like that's how much like he was like going through
it in there and that's really when i was like because these are hard like these aren't no bitches
you know what i'm saying and when you hear a grown man and know like there's nothing he can
can do to control this situation it's totally out of his hands like he is literally at the mercy of
whatever they want to do to him so they did that he's screaming he finally like calmed down from
screaming but he couldn't breathe so that's probably why i couldn't scream and they ended up having to
go in on a stretcher and get him out of there and the dude ended up dying like a couple days later
some shit we found out i don't know if that was true because that's through like you know the inmate
right telephone type shit well so what was the black stuff what what black jesus it's called black
jesus yeah it's a big oc mace oc mace but the shit shoots like a fucking fire like it's like it
shoots like so it's like big hands like a trigger on it yeah yeah and it was black like a trigger
like that they would put it on their belt you know i didn't walk around with it but yeah it was i think
they took it out of the prison system because of just how like ruthless and you know like people
that had asthma yeah there you go black label pepper spray yeah jesus black jesus fuck man
yeah i don't know if that was the real name i think it was though but that's what everybody's a good
name for it yeah no for real right just to make you see jesus yeah um and that's like really man
like where i was like that that was the first time ever in my life i was like man i need to change
my life because i'm in there and i'm in the dorm and i'm going to like get on the phone and you
look around and there's dudes that have been in there for 22 years who haven't gotten on the phone
or talked to anybody in like 15 years haven't had no like you know why because they're their family
died or they don't have any shit and nobody wants to talk to them but majority of people a lot of
that goes on in prison and you know like through my life i don't know about like you or anything but
like my parents would always tell me shit when i was younger right like you don't want to be a
drug dealer and i was like yes i do and now i'm in prison because of it so it's like i was like i
heard all that shit when i was young but i just thought i was different i could i was unique and
i wasn't going to get caught or whatever and now i'm sitting in prison with old guys like you know
in their 60s that got life or never getting out never seeing the daylight and they're telling me
like man if you keep doing what you've been doing you're gonna be me and that was really where i could
see it at that point i could see like like i could always tell myself man i got 10 more years to keep
getting in trouble but then it got to the point where like i was worried about the charge that i
was gonna get because the violence and the crime just keeps getting bigger and bigger when you're
on the street like it starts from you know selling pills to robbing pharmacies to writing scripts to
you know a bunch of different levels and then you know you're robbing people so now they could
have a gun you know so you never know like i lived for the day you know what i mean and it was then
that i was like man like i really need to get my shit together but i didn't know how to do it you
know what i mean i'd been like so caught up in the in the game for so long that like i didn't
really want to work a normal job because i i would always tell myself why am i going to go work for
you know 400 a week when i could be making five grand and that's what kept me in it but when
they put that database into effect and i went to prison again that was really like i was like
man like i want to do something different in my life you know i don't want my legacy to be
like a fucking low level drug dealer you know what i mean it's still doing the same shit yeah
what so like after you went to confinement after beating up that dude who was uh jacking off on the
lady uh what do you call him gunner gunner after you meet up the gun and they try to instigate
obviously like if you're gonna get out it's gonna be conflict between you guys again what happens
when you guys get out so we both got released the same time right it was like me him and like two
other guys so we we have our shit with the we go out to the bubble where the doors open and they
tell us what dorm we're going to so like he didn't say anything i didn't say anything we walked out
of the door confinement to go to our dorms and i just like i just stepped off over to him and i'm
like bro listen i'm done with that shit if you're done with it we're good but if you want to run it
back we can run it back but we might as well just do it here because we're not gonna you know we're
going right back here right so he was like no bro it's straight it's straight but still even then
like when i went back into the dorm and you know got in the groove of that dorm and like started
knowing people and shit like but when that was going on i was still like you know this dude could
come stab me when i'm sleeping it's nothing for him to leave his dorm and sneak off into my dorm
because the guards don't really give a fuck you know what i mean so it was like a probably a couple
weeks where there's nothing in between you and then when you're sleeping oh no no so like you're
sleeping as close to you are right now but we would just be laying down and that's how it is
but there's like no doors on your bunk not in an open bay in a cell you're you can have doors in a
cell it's called a t building and there you're gonna have doors but not in an open bay and even
when you have a door they make shit to pop the locks like you can get a you can get a soda can
and take off the thing under the lip and you can use that to pop your door or like there's other
shit too but so you're not you're not safe like and and and i'm not a small dude i work i was even
bigger in there i worked out all the time kept up top shape ready at any time to go and like i'm
i'm worried you know what i mean so i know like now i'm in a place where like like i graduated
to the next level of you know problems and i didn't gang bang when i was in there i you know after i
thought that dude and i got out of confinement i was on the yard and everything all the white boys
that are in like unforgiven and there i think there was some ab there and some other skinheads
they were like yo what's up bro you want to probate like to like probate to get into the gang like
you have to do like certain shit to get in and i was just like nah but i didn't like disrespect
them because at the same time like i didn't know what was gonna happen with the dude and i'm new in
this prison so i need to make some friends right in case like you know people are gonna try to stab
me or whatever but nothing ended up happening i ended up uh getting moved over to the work camp
and i but i didn't go outside the gate i didn't have a gate pass so i mean that was like a work
camp which is kind of different it's kind of more laid back but there was the same shit was going on
just not on the same level you know what i mean it was kind of more like chill it's crazy however
those people in prison are just reduced to like the most primitive form of humans
like jacking off on the girls walking down the hall that's fucking crazy it's like it's like
monkeys at a zoo i know it's what they do it would bro i was so disgusted with it like i had no idea
that that shit was like going on in there and then when you see it bro it's like the way i look at
it is he's raping that chick and we're all watching yeah you know what i mean it was so like we were
on the yard one time bro and they have gun towers in the prison yard like where the gate is so they
can see the whole prison and the yard and around so there's all these inmates on the yard right and
if you look up in the prison tower there's windows where the officers are so there's these like this
group of dudes that's over to the side where the picnic table is like there's like a blind spot where
the officer on the yard couldn't see them and they're jacking off to the person in the gun tower
except that gun tower nobody went up in it because it was under construction they were gunning a mop
turned upside down leaned on the window they thought it was a chick holy so they're gunning a
fucking mop bro that gives you any idea bro yeah that's crazy yeah so i mean if that gives you
any idea of what type of people and that like that was part of that was a big reason too why
i didn't want to go back is is because it was getting to the point where there's like so much
disrespect like you know you're just crammed in there with everybody you can't get away from anybody
and you're around a hundred different personalities from gunners the freaking murderers and i was just
like man like i could probably do more time but i can't do it with these people and i know if i come
back i'm gonna be doing it and it just got worse too as time goes on because in there everybody's
doing tucci and k2 so like they're literally strung out in prison and now you got all the
bullshit that comes with drugs and that lifestyle going on in there so it was there's an epidemic
like people are dying left and right in florida prison right now because really yeah is it true
most people i talk to they say they have like a super boosted immunity like immune system when
they come out of prison just because of all the shit they're exposed to like they don't yeah well
yeah you are sick like many people just say like they never get sick because they were exposed to
so much bullshit in prison and so much fucking i've seen a dude in prison right his arm was like
sitting up like this and he couldn't fold it down so he was walking around everywhere in his armpit
was a freaking thing like a softball and it was red and gooey and shit he had like either
Mercer or staff or whatever he had it could have been a spider bite so he goes to medical to be like
hey i can't put my arm down and they're like here's three ivy profan go back to the dorm you'll be
okay and that's their medical like that's all they do it's either Tylenol or ibuprofen for
everything unless you are like literally like you know you're about to die then they're gonna
like bay flight you out of there and shit but my god yeah the medical like that's scary too man
because you never know like you get bit by brown lakoo switcher everywhere up there in prison like
they're planting shit in you and next thing you know your pinky's falling off oh my god that's
fucking brutal yeah so all that shit man just like i think it was just all of it combined and then
you know when i got out i wanted to change you know what i mean i just didn't really like
know how i didn't know like what to do for what did they tell you when like right before you got
released did they say like we're gonna like i didn't even know when i was being released i had to have
my people that i was calling home to like tell me like my classification officer told me like three
weeks prior but it was just like hey here's where you go you got to go report when you get out to
the state of florida and you'll get a food stamp card and i think they gave i don't know i didn't get
i got picked up but usually they'll give people a bus ticket and like $50 i think it's even lower
than that it used to be a hundred a bus ticket and $50 yeah after like 10 years good luck buddy
i will see you back we'll see you in 48 hours yeah so i i mean i got out and i wanted to do the
right thing i like still was still fucking up a little bit um like with drugs and selling them
and doing them and just like not wanting to work a full-time job because i couldn't find one and if
i did it was like mcdonald's or and i just i don't know i guess my pride like wouldn't let me do that
i don't know why but so um i ended up make a lot of money working at mcdonald's now
yeah nowadays so um i just i tried to change at that point but i was still like one foot in one
foot out and like my grandma that raised me because my dad died when i was seven my mom was a
drug addict and alcoholic and still is um i was at work one day i'm working at the gym now so i'm
starting to like make that transition into like legal work and shit and i had met a good girl so
that helped a lot someone that never been in the life or you know any of that type stuff um i'm at
the gym and i'm leaving i'm going home my grandfather calls me and he's like hey go to uh
st joes in tampa that's where they're bringing your grandma so all this time like that i was doing
the pills and everything like my grandma had like anxiety because my dad died and my aunt died so she
buried both of her kids when they were like in their 20s so she already had like anxiety and then
she had um fiber myalgia so she was on the pain pills and the xanax like for her own shit
but i think along the line like even though like she didn't do crazy shit but she was addicted like
she had to have it every day or she felt like shit so she ended up getting put on oxygen because of
like you know that shit slows down your respiratory so you can be shortness of breath and shit like
that so they put her on the oxygen they put the thing in the garage of my grandparents house and
they run the cable into the living room and then she can walk into her bedroom so she can still use
it and she was trying to quit smoking but i guess she wanted a cigarette so she lit a cigarette and
the oxygen caught and burned her like literally gulfed her body and my grandpa's in the front room
so he he can't hear her scream because she's literally on fire and and can't breathe so like
i think that went on for a couple minutes and then he finally had went out and saw her and like you
know did what he had to do to to get her to the they ended up bay flight and her to the burn unit
and she had like third degree burns over i think like 80 percent of her body like she was she was
like in a coma or whatever they had did to her when i got there and she had a dnr so there wasn't like
like there was nothing we could do to give her back her quality of life you know what i mean so
yeah so and she i think had a dnr man because like she buried both of her kids and then she
helped raise me and now here i am you know fucking doing dumb shit so i think she was just
done with life man honestly like she told my grandfather if anything ever comes down to it
don't save me let me go Jesus fuck man so that happened and then i kind of was like
fuck everything you know what i mean i kind of wild out for a good minute like a couple months
or something and the girl i was with like stayed with me and she was like you're better than this
so over time man i just like finally had started to like understand like what life is you know what
i mean like i didn't i never had like responsibilities i never i never showed up where i said i was
gonna show up at what time you know what i mean i was always like i was just like like holidays
would pass and i was like dough christmas was like two months ago like i was so in like a
a fog man where i don't even know how i'm alive honestly like the shit that not only i put in
my body but you know just being in that life like you know you're getting robbed you're robbing people
like there's a lot of shit so um you know having a good woman in my life i think was like one of
the catalysts to me making changes because like i didn't i don't have any family you know what i mean
like i don't have anybody really other than like my wife i ended up marrying her and uh so she kind
of like i i i guess i was like just ready to change too but i just i wanted to do something more
with my life and then i started doing the personal training i got really good at that and i started
making like bonuses for being like top seller in the state and shit and then the shit happened
with my grandma and i was working at one gym and i kind of just like fell off you know what i mean
i was like i'm like i was just ready to kill myself honestly because i didn't you know it was like
it was upsetting and then so i stopped working at this one gym and that's when i meet the dude
saying like you helped me open this gym like he made me a personal training manager and
i started opening the gym with him and i did exactly what he said i didn't do anything wrong
you know what i mean and he was just like no one's gonna believe you you're a felon so when this was
going on i was i you know suit the department of labor sued him because he did this to three
other people so there was gonna be like a like an investigation on it and i was calling him on the
phone because i couldn't get him to give me my checks and then he finally just said like i'm
gonna give you a trust passing warrant if you come up here and ask for it like he wouldn't
even do it he'd have somebody else tell me that where's this guy now he ended up losing the gym
because he's a fucking scumbag and that's karma but he he's i don't want to his name's joe so but
anyways i recorded all his phone calls and i did an episode on it on my channel and told the whole
story and like put him out there on it you know what i mean and then you know after i did that
don't talk some yeah exactly so um and then that's when i found out about the youtube man like
we were kind of talking i was you know on break at work i was watching youtube next thing i know
there's like all these people that have been to prison telling their stories and like i watched
their channels go from like 10 000 subscribers to you know 100 000 200 300 000 and now they're
like making a living feeding their whole family and just from telling like their life you know like
what they went through yeah so i saw all that going on on youtube and i was like well i can do that
and i got a lot of good stories i could tell and i know a lot of people that have been in trouble
so it's pretty gonna be easy for me to find people right so as i'm watching the youtube like there
was like you know there was a lot of drama in the prison genre like between channels and shit so
i never saw a channel man where somebody like went on told all their stories and then like
use that turned it into a positive and then would help people that are still stuck in that
like where i was confusion on like you know what am i going to do with my life i don't see a
i don't see a way for change and so on my stuff like i you know i did an episode on the mayor i
was telling you about i do like stuff like that but when i do like interviews with people or i'm
telling like you know one of my personal stories like i don't i'm not just glorifying it you know
what i mean like yeah i made 50 grand one month selling pills but that was one month i made a
lot of money but i don't i didn't have shit to show for that when it was all done and said you
know when you're making a lot of money you spend a lot of money and then when you get high you
really spend a lot of money on shit that you don't even know like i would wake up and be like i bought
that like not even know yeah so i wanted to like you know make my channel different obviously
and i just want to you know spread the message that like people can change because i didn't
think i could you know what i mean and if like i've been with nothing you know what i mean i've
been not knowing where i was gonna sleep at night like that's where i got to and then having no
family even makes that more of a you know so i just want i want to i wanted to help people
is why i started and i also want you know to be able to like this is like a side hustle work for
myself and hopefully something will come out of it and if not i'll just do personal training you
know what i mean yeah man some of the most interesting people ever met have been on this show
people that have been in prison for a long time yeah you know people that have had a lot of time
to reflect you know i mean they have nothing to distract themselves with except look inward and
you know i mean reflect on their own lives and and you know that combined with the people that
they've met and the story that is most straight up the most fascinating people are people that have
you know done a lot of time in prison yeah i think it makes you appreciate the smaller things in life
what what do you what do you think the i don't know like how bad the opioid epidemic is right now
or like since Purdue has been shut down i don't know like what the statistics are on deaths or
anything but what what do you think the answer is for to you know to stop all of the overdoses
and you know obviously it's it's you can't make this stuff illegal you know if it's
if it stays legal and it's still prescribed you know to people who who need it or who are in pain
or who have cancer or whatever it is like what do you think the answer is to stop all the deaths
and all the the overdoses and everything i don't think you can man i think it's been going on since
you know the mafia was bringing heroin in like people i think now it's just on a bigger level
and it's more accessible and i think they're trying to not make it as accessible as it used to be
because like there was a point where my grandma couldn't even get her prescriptions filled because
of all the corruption and all the people dying and all the doctors being under like like they're
under watch now and now a normal person that really needs pain medicine because they have cancer or
you know a muscle disease or whatever that they can't get it because they're all being like we were
prescribed the most opiates at one time our state in the whole world like from other countries like
our country gets the most pills right so when that started happening and people are dying then the i
guess i don't know who's in charge of it but they were like all right we need to crack down so they
cracked down on purdue and and all those other you know manufacturers and then that's when i think
the fentanyl really started to take off and now it's which is a what is it a hundred times more
potent yeah like if you get it on your skin you can od right like there's a video of a cop arresting
a dude and he reached in his pocket and grabbed a bag of fentanyl it was open and didn't have gloves on
and he you like there's an actual video and you can watch the guys standing up and the other cops
like oh are you all right and the guy falls over right you say you saw that yeah crazy and he dies
well he didn't die but he he would have if they didn't hit him with narkin jesus you know it's
bad when all the cops have to carry narkin like that should tell you the level of what it's what
it's become that's fucking crazy i didn't know that i didn't know that video existed yeah it's like a
i think it's like a cop in arizona yeah i forget where but i remember seeing it it's it went viral
though yeah but he just gets like because he gets like dizzy and then just falls well i mean the
fentanyl thing is crazy especially because it's like someone like cocaine is being cut with it
yeah well like there's like three people that were just partied in la got like a month ago or whatever
and like or four people and two or three of them died and the one lady she lived she lived but she
was on life support or she like barely barely survived yeah bro that's like i've known probably
a hundred people in the last like two years that have died from either fentanyl like now they're
how many over a hundred man definitely over a hundred i used to know a lot of people that were
like i would help guys that are in programs like rehabs or i'd went to one a long time ago so i knew
like everybody in that whole thing and there's people literally dying like you know every week
there just because they leave and go get high and now they're doing fentanyl and well the problem
is if you make it illegal then cartels are just gonna are just gonna push it and that's what happened
with the now it's like fentanyl and meth i think are really like the top like i don't know if they're
the killers but they're up there with like ruining lives you know what i mean right yeah so i don't
know the answer i don't know the answer but i i would imagine that you know at least for prescriptions
for doctors who are prescribing this shit at least you gotta there has to be some sort of some sort of
something they have to communicate where they say that like this could ruin this could destroy your
life like this is what happens like make them watch a video or something like this is what
happens when you don't take when you take them for four days and then you don't take them for another
four days you detox you fucking get the shakes whatever it is like at least like scare the
shit out of people before they decide to take it if they don't know what it is i mean if you
already if you're already addicted to it you're kind of already fucked yeah exactly and just just to
give you an idea on why i don't think it's going to change is because i will go to a doctor now
like say i need to go for a monthly checkup and i'll go into the doctor and say hey i'm an addict
and i can't get narcotics because i'll fucking you won't recognize me you know what i mean right
and he'll at the end of the visit we'll talk and he'll be like okay so you had anxiety you
won't xanax right and i'm just like bro like i so if that right there shows you like where are i
think it's the medical community that's responsible for pretty much all of this and then they paid
everyone else off through the process right it seems like that way anyways like when you watch
like that documentary there's tons others like wasn't even that documentary again i gotta
have it on my phone it's on hbm it's a fucking great documentary it was done by um alex gibney
who did um i believe is alex gibney he's the same guy who did the Scientology documentary
going clear that was a good one too yeah he's fucking yeah that's like what i would like to
get into is the documentary type stuff the fuck was it called oh the crime of the century
yeah so if you're watching go check that out because it's a good documentary that gives you like
that really puts it into perspective how big yeah alex gibney same guy who did going clear
yeah so i mean yeah but if you are you should be able to go to the doctor be like i'm addicted
like give me a well now they give you suboxone or methadone for that so it's literally like the
government's dope is the same is it do the same thing i mean the suboxone doesn't really get you
high i think it does when you first start taking it but then your body gets what it does is it blocks
the opioid receptors in your brain so if you take a pain pill the suboxone attaches an opioid
antagonist attaches to your receptors in your brain making your brain think you're high but you're
really not because you're not acting high so if you take a pill when you're on suboxone it can put
you into immediate withdrawals because if it crosses the brain the brain blood barrier you're
like having that is like it'll put you in i don't know what causes the exact reaction in you
but you'll literally just be like you're dope sick when about five minutes ago you were you know
cutting the ham at turnt or Thanksgiving Jesus Christ yeah so i mean it's and then you know
it was methadone and then now they develop suboxone subucade where they'll shoot it in your arm and
it's good for like 30 days or something yeah but people man are just gonna get high they'll find a
way to get high on that there's people that are shooting suboxone that are sticking it up their
ass all kinds of shit man like they're if an addict will figure out a way to get high if they want
to like you can you know move to fucking indonesia and you're gonna find the dope man right if you
really want to and fentanyl where did fentanyl when what year did that come on like when did that
become popular that it was around when i was doing shit back in the day but it was the patches so like
only like really fucked up people could get it and there was like time released and you just stick
it on you and it's a transdermal like type deal yeah and now like i mean i don't i would never
really like i've never actually had fentanyl in my hands or like seen it but i know from watching
all the people i know die and you know or odn that like it's they're putting it on everything
oh this is the cop yeah yep that's him don't put the audio on because oh fuck yeah he he just like
fell out bro jesus he just touched it in a guy's pocket that's what i'm saying man that and what
is this thing called narcan narcan narcan yeah and even with that sometimes though you won't
like he's completely out bro yeah in san diego yeah wow that's fucking terrifying so and people
are using that bro like they're addicted to fentanyl that's how like it's so when a drug addict
takes pills for a while like his normal dose ain't gonna get him high and that's where the
tolerance and that's where like you know the money you know some people spend five hundred
dollars a day just to get high and so but now their tolerance is so high the fentanyl so prominent
everywhere that it's on everything like people are lacing xanax with fentanyl so you don't know
what you're gonna get it's like playing russian roulette one day you know what i'm saying and
now the drug addicts are addicted to the fentanyl like they're doing fentanyl as an everyday drug
so imagine it's just straight fentanyl yeah or they'll cut it like with heroin or a lot of it's
in heroin could you imagine like that's that's the drug you're doing like the drug i do is so
strong i have to cut it with heroin right it's next level yeah bro so i mean some of them don't
even cut it it's just they'll just do it so now you're addicted to a drug that kills somebody
that's my camera oh went out oh oh i didn't change the battery can i use the bathroom yeah yeah
it's a hyperbaric chamber it's like an oxygen chamber what for what does that do it like it's
you sit in it like anti-aging and stuff like it like what it does for you like like a lot of
like a lot ton of NFL players use it and what it does like after games obviously you get beat the
fuck up your whole body is destroyed and they get in those things and what it does is it hyper
oxygenates all the cells in your body and makes them red it like it like super charges like
repair of all your cells and like all the tissue everything in your body do you like feel have
you been in one i've never i've never been in one you're about to but i saw i've seen lebron has
one and he goes in it like when during the playoffs like the NBA playoffs he goes because
they have sometimes they have like games every other day yeah it's crazy you got to be like
tipped off tour to france guys do that i'm sure they do yeah tons of athletes do it yeah to get
there like blood right or something the crazy thing is when i called the place there's i think
there's like one dealer in the u.s who sells them and i called him like hey uh can i get one of those
hyperbaric one of those lebron james hyperbaric he's like yeah he's like yeah i have a prescription
though i'm like okay so you gotta go to a doctor what we're talking about we gotta i gotta go get
a scratch i gotta get bro it's all connected yeah yeah it's made by purdue it's made by purdue
i feel like it's time to go to work he's gonna be like i'm not leaving my chamber yeah oh it's
fucking hilarious yeah well cool bro that was a girl uh we had to cut take a cut a little break
but we're back and we can wrap it up now well what tell me so like what kind of people are you
interviewing on your channel so i interview bro like i interview a guy that had a life sentence
for weed he got out he did like 20-something years i interview a gang member that was stabbing
everybody he saw in prison and then i've also interviewed a dude that was paying rent and
getting his shit took and getting his ass beat and tortured every day in there so i try to bring on a
wide variety of people at first i was kind of like a guy who's getting his ass when the guy was
getting raped oh no i never had that oh his ass beat oh okay okay and they and in there bro like
depending on where you're at you can literally be tortured like at the jit camps in florida
juvenile prisons yeah and there are literally like five dudes that hold an inmate down and the other
dude fucks him in the ass with a broomstick like that's the kind of torture i mean not like you
know somebody just punches you in your shit like like you have to fight one of them and then when
you're done the next one comes in and you got to fight him and they call it uh like lining it up
where they'll line like 10 dudes up and you just got to fight every one of them back to back to back
but eventually like you can't do that like i don't care who you are like so you end up getting stomped
into the ground and some people that have that happen never fight back or never do anything so
and when you do that now you just told everybody like basically do whatever the fuck you want to
me and i don't care because they're just so scared and then you have other people that that happens
to and then they fight back and that's what it takes you got to fight back because then they see
like they called a toh was like a test of heart so they're kind of testing you to see like are you
really about that life right are you going to make it through this and then when you do they're
like all right that's what's up but i didn't get that shit like i'm not i'm not that type of dude
like if we fight i'm not we're done we're not talking i'm not going to be your friend you know
what i mean right and so yeah so that goes on all the time and then i bring the guy that i brought
on he was getting beat up they were taking his shit and stuff like that they called a jizzle in
florida like all that dude's a jizzle meaning he'll like pay you and wash your boxers and do
shit like that and like when i first went to prison and i saw that happen because i never
really had that happen to me like i was blessed i don't know i guess i just skated through or
whatever but like i fought but no one ever took it to that level and tried me like that you know
what i mean but i you know i bring people on that has had that happen because the majority of people
that go to prison end up becoming a victim whether it's in you know people are taking your money
they're taking your canteen your washing clothes like boxers type clothes washing or you know you're
you're doing dishes after they eat at night or you know they there are a lot of people bro that
go there they get caught up in like either they join a gang and that shit comes with the gang
because now you got gang members that are above you if you get money now you know you got five
other your gang members that if four of them don't now you're feeding them and it's like kind of like
a hierarchy i guess but um in florida man it's just like if you're white you're the outcast and if
you're not in a gang you're definitely an outcast so i but i did it bro so it can be done you made it
yeah it's scary here in this kind of shit man especially come on with the when you hear statistics
like the united states is the number one has the number one like is the number one country in the
world of the highest incarceration rate with the highest incarceration rate than any other country
and the most opioids prescribed and the most opioids yeah it's a and it's a fucking cycle
yeah they feed each other and cycle definitely is man i know a lot of people right now man that
are still in that life that are still that are never gonna like see that light you know what i mean
they're just like they have this saying you either like you either go to jail or you die or you go on
to the bitter end meaning like you're okay with how fucking bad your life is because
like you just can't see it any other way because you're like when you can't stop taking something
to act normal or you'll be sick everything else doesn't matter anymore because if you're sick
you can't do anything else so that become you become a slave and i think that's kind of like
what perdu wanted and i think that's why their shit got you know eventually got caught up with
and everybody found out what they were doing because they were paying those fda people to sign
off on their shit knowing telling people this is a short term solution when really they knew the
whole fucking time once we got them they're got right and how do we make higher doses how do we
come up with more pills how do we give out more right so i don't know but i don't see it changing
anytime soon and it's just i mean you you probably know somebody that's had problems with it before
lots of people man tons of people way too many people it's crazy i look back at people i like
went to school with man same here like i've heard so many fucking stories it's it's it's
fucking frightening how many stories i've heard i mean especially especially when i was not younger
in high school too like i knew so many people that were fucking caught up in that shit people dying
all the time and i know man it's sad bro now it now i'm lucky i never got caught up in it i'm just
lucky i guess that's that's see that's what i i was like damn how did i get caught up in this
because my mom was a drug addict my you know uh she would get drunk around me when i was a
kid and her boyfriend her boyfriend had been to prison like seven times or beating her ass so
i'm seeing all this go on you know what i mean but watching her get drunk and her get high i was
like man i don't like i don't want nothing to do with that and i never drank alcohol and then you
know one day you know you're in school and somebody's got some shit and then you start doing it and
even then bro like i didn't like it i think it's just like i had that that gene in me you know what
i mean like a predisposition to being an addict right and i kind of saw it more in the beginning
of my life because i would get addicted to shit like if i played paintball i needed to have five
friends that played it we needed to build a fucking field out back with bunkers like i took everything
like i have that gene too i have that same gene like addictive personality oh yeah i gotta be
careful i gotta be careful whenever i try new shit addicted to video games is one of the worst
things too yeah that war zone i'll get you god damn war zone fortnite yeah fucking
pg i've been on pga2k the golf the golf game i only played war zone that's like the only i've
never played war zone i've tried call of duty i've tried tried call of duty a few times i can just
never get good at it that's not your thing yeah the video game thing is like once you get good
at it then you start getting addicted but if you suck it's easy to not want to play yeah
that dopamine yeah exactly i want what i want when i want it yeah exactly right now yeah well
cool bro tell everyone uh listening and or watching where they can find your your content online so
you can go on youtube uh type in doc tv 813 and i'll probably the first one that pops up i just
made it like i think a year ago actually uh today so not today but round here so yeah man show i love
your videos man they're really cool i saw you went on mat and mat or you went on mat show that was
really cool yeah yeah that's another guy that's another guy that's similar to you he you know he
got out of prison with nothing and then he just turned turned this his youtube channel into all
these just opened up all these opportunities for him yeah and i met matt from youtube that's kind of
oh really like the first month i had a channel i had watched him on like date line or one of those
fucking shows like 10 years earlier and then i have a channel now and i'm like man i want to
reach out to some people that got some crazy crimes and see if i can get them on you know yeah and i
just stumbled across one of his videos and i was like man this dude looks familiar he looks younger
though yeah and i come to find out he had like plastic tons of plastic i was like damn he spent
about ten thousand dollars on his hairline i know hey that shit looks good though it does it looks
fucking better than mine i know right me too but yeah so i met him and and we kind of like connected
like we kind of hit it off now we're like even more you know friends than we were then yeah he's a super
cool guy i think he probably thought when he met me i was kind of like flaky because i just made my
channel you know everyone when they first start youtube they're like oh i'm gonna i'm gonna this
is for the rest of my life and they get so like addicted to it and then they don't go anywhere
and they kind of fall out so but luckily for me man my channel's just been steadily growing i think
i'm at like 3,500 subscribers that's sick oh yeah yours is like the biggest channel i'm gonna be on
so hell yeah well i'm sure it's gonna be more after this i hope so man i'm i'm just i love it
bro i love doing youtube i love all the editing i learned how to like not knowing i didn't know
how to do any of this bro i edit all my own shit i do all my own thumbnails i do everything myself
and i'm not i don't see that changing unless i start making like crazy money yeah oh yeah well
once you start trying to make more and more stuff you know what i mean it makes more sense to get
people to help you do certain things you know things that people some you know find somebody
who's good at doing graphic design whatever get them to do your thumbnail and that way you can
make more stuff like that's what matt's doing man i think matt has like a team of people like matt's
got more people working for him than i have that i have helping me i know and i even text his editor
i'm like you know what about this you know sound mixer and he's like yeah that's good so yeah i'm
trying to kill it man matt's matt's doing a great job i love i love seeing like how far he's made
it just from now because i saw him like literally the week when he got out of like the week he got
out of whatever the halfway house yeah the same week he came in here and then like for more reason
now he's fucking doing flying people flying him to europe to do tv shows and i know it's crazy how
much he's doing man you need so many different like but it's hard to you know you gotta have the
disc he's got the he's got like the the he's able to like put in the time to call his probation
officer and do get all these documents to travel and like he has to jump through so many hoops just
to do this stuff that's what kept me from going on his channel man his probation officer wouldn't
let him interview me oh really yeah so we had to like wait i think he changed probation officers
or some shit happened or she gave him like go ahead on something else and they got they got
his bank account locked down because he's got restitution he's got 11 million dollars restitution
has to pay back to the wells fargo it's comical and it's fucking comical yeah like they're gonna
get all they're gonna make him drag that ball chain forever i know man and that's crazy bro i feel
like once you do your prison sentence like you should be done man like now you get 20 years and
fucking 80 years probation after it yeah well there's your life are you selling probation
no no okay that's good yeah well thanks for coming on man i really enjoyed uh i really enjoyed this
conversation i really appreciate fascinating stories man i really appreciate you having me on
too man so absolutely to both of you guys absolutely man well thanks again yeah all right
goodbye world
