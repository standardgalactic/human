Will Grant is a professional BMX racer and bodybuilder who sustained some
horrific knee and shoulder injuries through his racing career, which crippled
him for a very long time. It wasn't until he discovered the use of breathing
techniques like Wim Hof, meditating, fasting, and these strategic muscle
balancing techniques that we talked about. He's not only been able to heal his
body 100%, but he's back to racing bicycles professionally again. So if you
are even remotely interested in optimizing your mind and optimizing your
body, this podcast is definitely for you.
Talking. Talking. I'm not very good at it, which is why I started doing this. I suck at
talking. This is like just like a challenge for me. I think we have the
same watch except you have a gold one. 12 bucks on Amazon? 10. I think you paid
too extra because you're just gold, dude. Is it the Casio? Hell yeah, dude. It's sick.
Yeah, it sucks. So all right, so for people out there who don't know who you are,
just give me sort of like a brief introduction to who is Will Grant. I mean,
I'm still trying to figure that out myself. Yeah. I mean, aren't we all? Yeah, always.
Who is Will Grant? I mean, I could tell you a little backstory. I guess I was born
in Washington state. I moved here when I was like eight, nine years old with my
mom, my brother, a couple of dogs, a bunch of cats, like dude in this tiny little
U-Haul truck. I was a five day drive and we got here and I mean, honestly, my mom
was like addicted to hell of drugs. Like that's a huge reason of what
got us to Florida because like in 99 to 01, that's when Florida was getting in
all that trouble for like like pill mills. Like they were just giving out like
oxycode and all those drugs from the doctors. Yeah, so Florida's famous for.
Yeah, and we lived out in the middle of the woods. Like it took us probably half
hour to get to the closest gas station and so my mom broke her back and then
she had some family here from Brooklyn and plus like she knew about the care
here. Yeah, we ended up moving to Florida then and started racing BMX when I was
like, I think 10 or 11 years old. My brother actually got me into it. He was
stealing everybody's bikes around the whole neighborhood like bringing all
their bikes, taking apart, spray-painting them and then like selling them back to
people and like he was talking about getting a race in and I was just three
years younger wanting to do what my big brother did and that's awesome. But
except I had a dad, he didn't really have a dad. My dad bought me a bike for
Christmas. You guys were stepbrothers? Yeah, so we're
half-brothers. I got two, but we don't call each other half-brothers. My mom
told us from a young age, your full brothers, there's no such fucking thing as
half-brothers. So we were raised thinking like we're all we got, you know what I'm
saying? For sure. Yeah, and then I ended up getting a bike. Actually it was for my
birthday and then so yeah, I was living with my mom and then when I was like 10
my dad said that I can move in with him and pursue BMX like full time as like a
10-year-old, you know? So like I did I left the trailer park, I moved in with my
dad who I thought had all this money, all this opportunity and we traveled
around the world really racing BMX and then when I was 15, dude, I mean it was
tough living there man. It really was. It was actually a lot tougher living there
than my mom's house and at 15 I ran away. I just said peace, see you later. You just
ran away? Yeah. Why? I felt like I could do it better on my own. Yeah? Yeah, honestly like
dude, I mean at 15. Dude at 15 years old like I moved in with my dad to race BMX
you know for this like opportunity to like yeah really race BMX that's all I
cared about. You know I was young and crazy anyways and then I mean it he like I
was getting in so much trouble all the time like he was so strict with
everything to where like he would get home and there was like crumbs on the
table for me making a sandwich and I get the shit beat out of me you know like
dude he would check my homework every single night and if I had like a letter
that was a little slanted to the left he'd make me rewrite my homework 25 times
and then he'd find another letter that was messed up and then I would be
writing the alphabet for hours every night like he would walk up and if my
shoes weren't tied tight enough he would flip me over and say what's wrong with you?
You can't tie your shoes little boy you know what I mean and then like it just
kept like small like small things where I couldn't do anything like it felt like
I was living in prison you know like all I was really allowed to do was train for
BMX and then when something happened. So he was kind of like was he was he really
pushing you hard on BMX or was it kind of like you he was just supporting what
you wanted to do or do you think that was coming a lot from him kind of
pushing you to do BMX? I mean it was I mean I wanted to do BMX right for sure
you know what I mean but he had the mindset as if I didn't do everything as
best as I possibly could for that then he wasn't gonna take me to the races you
know so he would come home and make sure my bike was clean like everything
around my whole life was perfect you know so so I focused on that but then
after when I was like 15 like I kept something small something stupid he just
said you're not racing anymore and then I mean it wasn't a good healthy
relationship and then once I realized I wasn't racing like I just left like I
mean BMX was everything that was important to me and then I was supposed
to go live with my mom but I knew I wasn't going back to that trailer park
like so I just left I crashed I mean I had friends I slept on the floors I
slept on couches I slept slept outside you know what I mean and then when I
turned 16 actually there was a family in BMX after eight months of after
running away he heard about my situation and he said yeah I own a business my
kid races BMX and I'll let you live in my house if you just train my kid to race
BMX because I was only 15 16 then but I was like national champion you know I
like won everything so a lot of people I guess look or a lot of even kids younger
than me looked up to me at that age and then yeah so I moved into this house he
gave me two rules just respect his house and stay away from his daughter and yeah
I end up getting engaged to his daughter oh my god yeah that's a whole
different story and then and then yeah then I was like I'm going pro 16 years
old and I turned pro at 16 and then I end up tearing my ACL MCL PCL meniscus
everything like three months into turning pro when you were 16 years old so
like I turned pro and I was 16 and then like my my birthday was like the next
month so then like a month after being 17 yeah I tore my ACL I tore everything
so you just exploded your fucking knee yeah exploded yeah I wanted my first pro
races too and then and then it took me a year to get that healed and then my first
race back didn't even crash put my foot down retort everything like oh yeah
dude because I was a minor you know with free insurance comes free doctors
yeah three doctors comes some guy that's just rushing and hacking up your
body you know so I mean I didn't even crash I just you know I did physical
therapy perfect and everything but I just put my foot down and it retort
everything and then at that time off I became a personal trainer you know like
I wasn't able to race so I you know and I had this passion for fitness I had this
passion that's when you were like a bodybuilder right yeah when I was yeah
during that two and a half to three years that I was injured I just started
training my upper body as much as I could you know and I was still keeping my
legs fit as much as I could because I was doing like I'm trying to strengthen
my leg and doing my own like physical therapy for the knee but that's hard to
do leg training when you have a fucked up knee right well yeah so so when I
became a personal trainer like the first surgery I got I got because I was a
minor so I got the free insurance but then after that I was I was 18 and the
only way I could get individual inch or really insurance to get my knee fixed
was I had to have a job that offered the insurance so I became a personal trainer
at a gym I did there three four months so I can get their insurance yeah and
then and then I found the best doctor I could but then at that time I was a
personal trainer I thought I knew everything I was the shit I don't need
no physical therapy you know so I started doing my own like training for my
legs to build up my strength and I thought I knew what I was doing and I
ended up building up a lot of bad habits of movement to where like I had all
these imbalances you know so so when you have a surgery or when you have any
trauma to your body there's muscles that get extremely tight to protect and
there's muscles that turn off and then physical therapy is really meant to
rebalance okay muscles to turn on those muscles and to relax the muscles that
are too tight why do you think your muscles were so out of balance was it
because of the bodybuilding or because of the BMX so so after that second
surgery on my ACL I did all my own physical therapy and I didn't know what
I was doing you know honestly like like I just went right back into training
instead of fixing the issue right you know it's like any problem that you have
like if you just try to mask the symptom it's gonna cause bigger different
issues later on yeah you know and that's what happened was like I never kind of
relearned how to move properly so then like just every little movement that I
was doing like I just wasn't using my body properly you know but and that's
something that almost everybody's doing right you know like almost everybody is
using their body improperly because we're a sitting culture we sit down all
day which brings our chest our quads our hip flexors everything too tight while
our glutes and our back just don't know how to activate so then we have all these
imbalances in our body and and you know depending on who you are is what's
gonna hurt first so if it's your knees if it's your back if it's your shoulders
or whatever it is but it just comes from the imbalances and then what happened
to me was what would have normally happened to me if I was 40 years old it
happened really quick because I wasn't athlete getting injuries right you know
but like I said if you talked to the the normal 45 year old his back hurts his
knees hurt you know his shoulder hurts and it's just from bodies being in
balance from whatever they're doing I just went to the chiropractor for the
first time in my life like two weeks ago like because if my lower back started
really fucking hurting I don't know why there was no trauma there was nothing to
really explain it and other than the fact you know I like go to the gym just
like anybody else I do you know cardio I try to balance my workouts with everybody
they found out and my yoga instructor actually pointed out that my like my
IT band and my hamstrings were like unusually tight and that's what was
contributing to my lower back being so much pain so now I'm been like using a
what do you call it a tennis ball to like roll out my legs a lot more and like
focusing on that and that's really helped a lot yeah yeah really good stuff
just imbalances what all those pains are and you know and it's the way we're
living really you know like with the way we're moving and using our body and
even like the way we're moving and using our mind is just not really balanced
with the way it should be so it's causing like chipping or pain in some way
at what point when I saw you the last time like I said earlier the last time
I saw you was at Josh's wedding and and I asked you what you've been doing and
you said that you don't work you like I don't work out my upper body anymore I
just do legs all I do is legs and it just the rest of us works itself out like
I work out my legs and it makes my arms strong like what were you doing at that
point so then I was just training like full athlete for BMX okay and like and
yeah I really wasn't training my upper body like going into the gym and doing
bench right I mean dude if you're doing like compound movements like
deadlifts like power cleans you know front squats like you're bracing you're
using your body using every part of your body yeah yeah you're using your body
the way it's supposed to as one full moving piece not necessarily targeting
your chest or targeting your back and then I still had that muscle tone when
you seen me because from like 16 to 22 I was lifting my upper body like a body
builder trying to get jacked for the honeys you know right yeah but then yeah
and then when I was just racing for those from pretty much when I got back to
like 21 to 25 yeah I mean I was training hard not necessarily the smartest way to
train you know like I I should have had a coach you know what I mean you know like
I should have hired somebody who was smarter than me but it's hard to learn
when you know everything you know what I mean of course yeah and I was in that
mindset of like dude I was the shit I knew everything you know what I mean like
you know I spent my whole life like building up my ego and to make myself
seem as great as I possibly can yeah and then well how could you be a fucking
bodybuilder doing bodybuilding competitions and like without a massive
ego to accompany it it's tough it's tough how could you you have to align your
purpose with something else which right definitely wasn't you know like I was
trying to get as jacked as possible right like you know people feel like they
care about me or they love me right you know to get that value in right in most
kid I mean most kids that age group are doing sure and like my whole entire life
Danny my whole life I put all the value in myself and what I could physically do
and what I physically look like like and that's what I put all my value in and
that's what I work towards and then when dude I lost all that you know then
all of a sudden my body started breaking down my mind started breaking down like
what I did when I was 21 22 wasn't still as cool anymore yeah you know what I
mean like you know and even my racing like I wasn't getting the best results
you know my even my career in BMX was just getting like worse and worse and
yeah I was getting less and less relevant and like all this stuff that I put this
value in was just dwindling away and then all of a sudden my body started
breaking down like I mean I'm talking I had so much pains in my bodies from my
ankles to my knees to my hips to my back I couldn't even open my hands all the
way and it's just from like I was going hard too like not just in BMX but just
in my life and partying and yeah like in all this stuff like I was going so fast
and so hard in my life and like the more pain I felt physically mentally
emotionally you know the faster I went you know because I noticed when I started
slowing down I started feeling that pain if it was mentally or physically or
whatever it was so I would just try to go as fast as do as much as I can and then
it was just causing more chipping of my body of my mind and then and then it
took to the point where everything literally broke I broke my leg you know
my whole knee exploded my femur cracked like dude my collarbone broke like was
the femur cracked was that in a bike race or a bike accident so not
necessarily but it was in training like in like this okay so it was on a bike
yeah yeah so um so let me get this straight to make sure I don't femur
that's fucking gnarly yeah yeah so like so I built up all these bad movement
patterns right so I had all these awful imbalances like where I was walking like
shit I was moving like shit and then it hurt so bad to use my body
when I wasn't training I was just sitting on the couch and then it was just
getting worse and then once I started realizing like all my shit was out of
balance I started working on rebalancing it and then when I was working on
rebalancing it you know like starting doing yoga and starting doing movement
therapy to help rebalance my body um and I started but I never took a break you
know like I never took a break from the training I never took a break from the
riding I you know I just started to rebalance something but when something
is out of whack or twist and turned and then you align it read back but the old
grooves are still there it's going to cause something to crack you know it's
going to cause something because if something was moving like off balance
are you talking about like bones right there yeah yeah so or really anything
a joint yeah okay one thing always works the way everything works everything's
yeah right so like so it if your knee is supposed to work in alignment like this
yeah you know and perfectly and then if you have imbalances it's slightly
turned or just going off that track a little bit right it's going to cause
potholes it's going to cause chipping away and okay to chip like any machine
and then when I slowly started working at realigning that the grooves were
different so then it caused it to crack it caused it to explode because I just
kept riding I kept training I kept and then it was like a stress crack almost yeah so
then literally I'm riding a practice you know my knees starting to feel funny but
I didn't want to stop you know like like anything when I was feeling this pain I
was mr. tough guy you know what I mean like I wouldn't admit I felt any pain
because I'm tougher than that or yeah I thought and then I just kept riding and
then all sudden then all sudden it just like exploded and and and dude what was
crazy was when it exploded like all of a sudden it hurt so bad to walk
just to put my foot on the ground I was in so much pain and I didn't know like what
was going on you know I was like oh this is going to buff out you know but yeah yeah yeah
two three days two three days later it didn't buff out and it was getting worse
and worse like I literally couldn't put my foot down you know without like just
extrusioning pain in in my knee and I'm thinking like what the fuck you know yeah
and then Hurricane Irma came you remember the big oh yeah I fucking remember that
shit yeah so Hurricane Irma came and we lost power for like two weeks and that's
sucked and that's when I fasted that's when I did that eight day fast oh really
yeah yeah um so what now what I don't want to I don't want to jump ahead I
don't want to jump ahead but I want to get into fasting we don't have to get into
it right now because this is obviously happening way before Irma dude yeah dude
the knee stuff the thing with your femur well dude my femur broke like a week
before Irma oh shit okay yeah yeah so like so while I was riding and training
like pushing through all this pain that I was dealing with like like my knee
exploded and then Irma came okay and then Irma was a big
hurricane that hit Florida and we lost power for two weeks and then
it's weird I kept hearing about these small things of like how fasting helps
heal your body right you know like and then I was hearing that it just helps
like rebuild your cells you know yeah where'd you hear from like dude I'm
just around it all yeah yeah like I'm around health people all the time yeah
I originally like who was telling me the most about it was actually my old
racing buddy Mike Caldwell he used to live with me okay you know and like dude
he tore apart his body where his whole like adrenal fatigue got so gnarly like
his whole body shut down so he had to rebuild his whole entire body and like
he was telling me how fasting is literally like the best thing you can do
but then I just could never have time to fast because I was too busy training so hard
you know and like you know dude it's hard to train if you're not gonna you know like
you can't train if you have an empty stomach like that like not over days and days so then
dude hurricane I had no power the only thing open was
McDonald's yeah I couldn't ride I couldn't train because I can't freaking walk
and then oh and I couldn't get a doctor's appointment because everybody was out of
power right so I was like all right what a weird time that was do with Irma the whole
town was like a fucking ghost town it was weird right it was like eerie yeah dude and I'm just
sitting in my backyard like dude full hunger mode like dude reaching different levels so at what
point did you decide to fucking fast like before the hurricane got here or after you lost power
dude the hurricane got there and then we all lost power and the only like dude everything
just set up perfectly to where like the only thing that I could have eaten was McDonald's
okay you know what I mean so you're like fuck it yeah so then like I was like dude
my knees fucked up the only thing is McDonald's I can't get a doctor's appointment like
I'm just gonna try 24 hours right and then the goal is to do 24 hours and after I hit 24 hours
I woke up the next day and I'm like shoot I think I can go two days you know and then during the
two days my buddy Mike Caldwell was telling me shoot you know if you hit three days your body
has already rebuilt its whole entire immune system right and I was like I'll make three days
hell yeah right so then you went for it yes so then I made three days and then he's telling me
you know after three days when your body rebuilds its whole immune system
then that's when it really uses all of its resources on rebuilding all of your cells
and rebuilding your cartilage and just rebuilding regenerating your whole body yeah it's like being
born again right yeah so so so then I went and I just kept fasting and and then I couldn't get a
doctor's appointment either so then and then he was telling me after like six seven days like
dude it starts getting like spiritual like this different level of perception this different level
of understanding and like what it's from is like your body or most of us our bodies and our stomachs
are always working on digesting because we're eating all day right you know what I mean other
than the first hour or so that you're awake your body is using most of its resources on
digesting food right so it's truly amazing what your body can accomplish when it's not working
on digesting food like all of our organisms and all of our biology and our chemistry and our
physiology wants to fight for health so when when it's not being preoccupied by all this
bullshit that it has to digest it instantly goes into just start healing and rebuilding and cleaning
and we have all this all these toxins that are in our body yeah every time that we eat a bad food
or breathe shitty air or breathe in exhaust fumes or even have a bad emotion you know if somebody
cuts you off on the side of the road and you think oh fuck that guy that just produces toxic
chemicals that are released inside your body right and we're 75 percent water and that's
where they all sit you know and like all of our these emotions sit in our body as like toxic you
know whatever so um just for our body to start cleaning that out dude you feel it you smell it
you taste it you taste all these toxins just releasing your body like you smell bad like you
taste it like like after three days like you know going to the bathroom is a lot different too like
it just gets empty and yeah you're seeing this all this nasty stuff that's in there did you have
the mucoid plaque come out dude like it's hard to tell you know that line you know there's the
stuff that lines inside of your guts that's like it's like old sewage like old plumbing it looked
like it yeah but like i mean i didn't like you know analyze it you know how many how many days did
you do eight days holy shit i did eight days and and this is what's crazy um you know and this is
not like scientific fact but they say that like about a one day fast we'll clean out about a whole
years worth of toxins okay wow so like if you don't eat for 24 hours your body cleans out about all
the bullshit that you've given it for the past year yeah like i'm not sure if that's science you
know but that's just what i've heard right and then they say so if you went through some big like trauma
especially big emotional trauma that might have caused a lot of toxins you almost regrow through
that while you release that so for example if your mom died like four years ago on that fourth day
you start having those emotions come up you know and you're releasing those emotions you're learning
from those emotions like a crazy thing is going on there and like it's really hard to explain
unless you experience it but what's crazy is after eight days i weighed the exact same weight as i
weighed eight years prior and something like all of me running away from home and all that craziness
that happened when i was like 15 years old was about seven years prior and i refelt all that going on
and then afterwards i never felt so like clean so pure like my my understanding my you know my
paradigm just felt almost better than it ever was but when i first broke my fast i honestly was
thinking what the fuck where are my superpowers you know what i mean yeah because i heard about all
this crazy like suit like dude i just fasted for eight days why don't i feel like jesus yeah you
know what i mean like did i mean did you have any kind of like peak state that you were in during
the fast dude was there any point where you felt like did feel like jesus or felt like you could
fucking do anything or felt great um anything notable or you never quite really feel great yeah
you know what i mean right but you're diving into such a deep depth of yourself you're learning
what the fuck you went through you know like fasting is you'll learn so much you learn more from
an empty stomach than almost any other thing on this planet yeah food is is the the number one
drug that we're addicted to dude it's worse than detoxing off of probably any drug as food is
probably the hardest thing you're so right and you know and when you can withstand from food
you gain this inner sense of power this inner sense of strength that you take in all different
areas of your life when i was younger i grew up so poor so hungry to where like food was
something that when you have you had to get as much as you possibly could the second you got it
and i had this really bad relationship with food every time i was hungry i remember growing up
poor and i got upset you know what i mean and then it built all these more toxins that's
you know that's within my body but then as but then as you work through this and you start fasting
like your perception of food changes like you learn that okay like i went eight days without
eating i've only you know if it's lunchtime and my body's feeling hungry my relationship is not like
oh my god i have to eat right now and get as much food as i can but i'm more in control over those
urges 100% and then now it's like if there's bad food and i want it i choose to you know instead of
like having no control to where i need that bad food and that is one of the biggest strengths that
helps you with all different areas of life yeah it's food sex drugs yeah you learn a lot about
discipline when you try to fast for that long especially and you know it's weird is like the
way i felt i did a five day fast about a year ago and on the fourth or fifth day i was playing
basketball with my buddies and like normally if i play basketball it's high intensity you're running
around full court and usually after like one game on the second game i start to feel like that side
stitch where i gotta take a break or i'm winded i gotta take a break i gotta breathe i gotta drink
water i swear we played probably four games back to back and i felt no fatigue it was weird dude i'm
doing like high intensity cardio running and you're probably not supposed to do that's probably
not smart to do while you're fasting that's right but like i had no fatigue i didn't get that stuff
that side cramp i normally get and then i went to the gym and i can normally do i'm like i'm a
pussy i can do maybe eight pull-ups on normally like just per one set of eight i could do like 20
dude no lie it was so weird i could not explain it how on a fast i could have so much more endurance
yeah um but then i saw i read i listened to a podcast uh tim ferris podcast where he interviewed
i forget the guy's name dr dominick something south florida doctor who studies fat like really
studies nutrition and fasting and he talks about like the key tones in your blood and how um like
our ancestors when we were hunt when we used to hunt food old human monkeys yeah that we would have
to go you know seven to ten days before we would eat and that's when our mind and body has to be
working at its best right because we have to find food right and at the seventh day tenth day you
haven't eaten how are you gonna how are you gonna stock down your prey how are you gonna chase down
whatever the fuck it is you're trying to eat and you have to have energy so those key tones that
go in there in your blood after you haven't eaten for so long the way it breaks down i don't know
the i can't remember exactly the science of it but the key tones in your blood basically give you
a longer sustained amount of endurance yeah it's a different type of energy it's a different
type of energy and it lasts longer it's crazy dude it's fucking gnarly you know and i think like
we don't activate that or get into that much because of our modern day lifestyles for sure is
always being available for sure like we lose so much of our inner powers and inner abilities and
strengths because we kind of donated away to these modern technologies yeah you know yeah just
building disciplines you that fast was definitely by far one of the best things i did in my life
you know because i needed to get all that toxic emotion that toxic bullshit out you know especially
in my early 20s i was sick in the head yeah i mean like there was something wrong with my head i was
living not the way i should just doing fucked up shit you know like living a toxic lifestyle
and then to get all that shit out of me and then almost like like you said like being reborn
yeah you know to where like i didn't feel like anything was crazy that first few days but it
all started settling in where i just felt better in my body yeah like a better understanding of
everything you know did you work out or do any kind of exercising when you're fasting i couldn't
because my not at all nothing like you couldn't do like like any kind of like pull-ups or push-ups
or anything no no no okay no because i like i was actually healing from a broken collar bone to
oh shit wow fuck dude you were jacked out so like i was fucked up man like i was stuck in my house i
couldn't raise my arm above my head i couldn't walk like dude i couldn't do and it was the only
and it was the best thing that could happen to me because it was the only thing that had me slow
down you know like it was the only thing that slowed me down that had me stop to to start processing
all this shit that was going on you know to get myself outside of myself and to start you know
seeing what is going on because i was going so fast you know like the dust would never settle so i
could never see what exactly where i was and what was going on and then when i slowed down and stopped
everything became real and started speaking to me and then i had to stop and listen and then
that's when i started meditating and breathing really everything changed that's when you found
out about wim hoff dude yeah like everything changed like i actually i saw you into switzerland
and and yeah you got some cold water yeah so so that was pretty sweet too but like so that summer
was yeah i think it was summer 2017 when i started doing like when i did the fast when i did the
wim hoff and like so i broke my collarbone i was healing from the broken collarbone
and i got clear to start riding three days into it like oh and during that time that i was healing
for my broken collarbone that's when i did a lot of the realignment therapy with my body and then
so then three days into training that's when my knee exploded and then that's when the fast happened
but when i or but that summer is when my brother um you know i was trying to find other ways to
train uh other other ways to better myself yeah to make myself great yeah you know um and i couldn't
train myself physically because my whole body was shutting down and then that's when i i kept
hearing things about meditation you know and i was understanding that well like if physical
exercise is the way to train your body meditation is the way to train your mind and i i never done
that before but i knew i needed it yeah right yeah so then you know i i would meditate here and there
and like never consistent but i knew when i did it it felt good and it was helping for sure i just
could never like build a habit of it and then when my brother told me about wim hoff um i got back
from washington state that summer and i was like i'm going to do this every single day and then
that week was the week that my leg broke and then i did the fast but i was doing the wim hoff
like every single day and my whole bot like i was starting to get outside of myself like get
outside of my ego and see myself from outside of myself like look you just lost everything
you put your value into yourself where are you at now yeah like your best thinking got you here
you know what i mean like you you don't have nobody around you you're sitting here miserable like
you're lost like dude are you living by yourself are you alone or would you have a roommate sir
i was alone really like i have a roommate but i think he was racing in europe at at the time
or something or like he was out of the country or you know or out of the state or something but
but yeah it's crazy and then i started there's something about that being alone by yourself
and being miserable what dude 100 like that's that's when you're going to grow and learn
the most dude and that's dude that's what happened like dude i just started blocking everything out
and connecting with my breath and then like our breath is our spirit like that's our doorway
into everything internal like every emotional pain every emotional joy every physical pain
physical joy like you know the doorway in to understand that is through our breath so then
when i just started connecting with my breath i was connecting with myself and then one i started
realizing that i put all this value in trying to make myself a badass and i'm i really ain't shit
you know what i mean like you know after all this like i realized i ain't shit because like
i ain't doing nothing for nobody you know i'm saying like like what am i contributing what value
am i bringing right and then when i look like i realized dude i've been doing all this for
for what for nothing and then and then that's when everything changed you know i started
like starting to put things into other people and then you know the more i started helping out
you know like the people closest to me like the better i felt like energy is energy right so if
they say that you become an average of the top five people around you like if you can just help out
you know people closest to you it's going to make you feel better you know and if you want to help
out you know the people closest to you if you just help yourself and make you better it's going to
help example around you yeah yeah exactly and then when i began breathing and and then that's what
for the first time i was able to stop and like understand what was going on like understand
this pain understand these emotions understand all this bullshit i went through as a child you
know instead of just blocking it out and trying to go so fast so i didn't hear it yeah you know i
i began to listen to it and like understand you know the depth of my self and my personality
and my purpose and you know and then i started like and the more i became in tune with myself
you know the more i started understanding why i'm here you know and what my gifts are and what my
talents are and like how i can really use these to contribute to society to the world to the people
i care about and that's when i created this whole plan and i've been going out of ever since hard
for like two years so what is what do you actually do with breath like what do you do with like what
is your like the breath just fucking breathe man yeah but when you focus on when you sit and focus
on you obviously meditate while you breathe yeah so how what's like the actual it's just like a big
the big end and then like the push out like the there there's a million ways to do it you know but
the simplest way to do it is to stop set a timer for five minutes three minutes ten minute whatever
you have and just feel your breath start breathing and notice the feeling of your breath going in
and notice the feeling of your breath going out and like normally after a few breaths then your
mind will go towards this you know or go towards what you got to do later or go towards what happened
right just notice that let it go and connect back to your breath that's the mindfulness of it yeah
exactly and then that act there of just noticing where your mind went and bring it back to your
breath that's strengthening your awareness that's strengthening your self-awareness that's strength
and knowing where your mind is going yeah and and that's the practice of being present right you
know and the more present you are in everything from your doing from a podcast to making a movie
to having sex to a relationship you know the more present you are the better you're going to be
not so much from sex i figured sex helps me more when i try to get myself out of the moment so
that way i last like an extra 30 seconds let me think about a chair yeah that's true that way
i go longer than the average uh two minutes yeah anyways but um yeah so then the breath so yeah just
connect to your breath man yeah you know and then you'll start to notice like the way you breathe is
the way you live yeah like if you're a shallow liver or if you're a shallow like if you live very
shallow you're most likely going to breathe very shallow right you know and like when you just start
connecting with your breath with no other distractions you'll start to know where your
mind goes you'll start to know where your mind goes when you're feeling good and when you're
feeling bad and you'll know how to kind of jump into the mechanics like like think of like an airplane
you know like a pilot they have all those different buttons and all those different controls to control
that airplane we have that too we just only know three buttons but we have hundreds of different
rights available to us right that we just don't know how to activate because we've lost through
this modern day culture of inside and fake lights and you know nice air condition like we lose our
ability to connect with ourselves and to use our tools that we have and to connect with our breath
you start to dive into those you know and start to understand yourself and the more you can do that
the better you're going to feel and the better decisions you're going to make and then one good
habit led to another led to another led to another and then my whole life my whole paradigm my whole
perception changed and now like I've never felt better like you know I mean like I've never felt
more confident and faithful and yeah where I'm at right now today yeah um but for Wim Hof isn't
isn't there a specific technique where you have to almost breathe where you feel like you're about
to pass out where you feel like really lightheaded so so Wim Hof is great because most of us ain't
fucking breathing right we're barely breathing like we're barely living you know what I mean like
we're hanging on right no one no one's most people haven't ever thought about breathing right no one's
ever thought about they just do it four years ago I never thought about my breath right you know
but I never really thought about where my life was going either you know I'm saying like and
and Wim Hof is getting people to breathe and breathe deep and when you okay and all it is is say
30 breaths 30 breaths of the biggest inhales you possibly can right 30 30 to 50 okay like 30 that's
a lot yeah yeah so like after 10 to 15 your body is not used to that because your body's not used to
all that oxygen because we're usually breathing so shallow you know unless you play sports or do
some sort of training you really don't breathe heavy that very often right so then to start breathing
in as deep as you can all of your cells all of your systems are being activated they're getting
woken up and they start to speak right and then after 30 of those deep inhales you possibly can
and those exhales you just released your body all that toxic carbon dioxide and replaced it with this
fresh new blood and or fresh new oxygen yeah you know straight into to your blood and then after
30 of those breaths dude you're lightheaded your hands are like shit you're about to pass out you
feel like dude this feels crazy yeah then one big last breath in and let it all out and then hold
and sit there empty yeah I mean empty lungs right yeah yeah yeah so just on that last exhale just
hold and sit there and witness be the observer you know and notice what comes up because your
body is going to be speaking to you whatever it wants to say like our bodies are speaking to us
all day but we don't understand the language we're only hearing our bodies when it's absolutely
screaming at us and we don't know what it's saying we're just like fuck it hurts you know
but our bodies are speaking at us all day and and when we stop and just listen and the more we listen
the more we can connect to that and the more we'll be able to understand that language and then
soon as something is off our body tells us immediately so then it never gets too far off to
where it feels pain right you know we can go around a lot of the suffering that we go through if we
just get really in tune with ourselves and in tune with our breath and understanding like yeah just
what the fuck's going on and that's with your breath so during that time of that breath hold
dude you start to learn about yourself like what comes up and then if you're timing those
breath holds like and this is what I did was to for a year too straight I was timing my breath
holds and I was journaling and writing all of this down to where like I had all these
new ideas of this way that I was going to change my life and change my body and change everything
I was doing but it was getting mixed up unless I started documenting it so I started documenting
my breath holds and then after doing that for a while you start to really notice when your
times were really good you're like when you could hold your breath a lot and when you can't
you know and there's a few things that I just kept noticing like patterns like
when I was focusing on the result or the number my breath holds were less
but when I was just in the moment just relaxing and let things be how they are my times were
way more you know like if I was doing it with other people the more I tried to compete with
the people next to me and try to hold my breath longer you know the worse my breaths were but
the more I sat there and thought like I hope he has a great time you know trying to give all the
people around me really good energy the better my times were you know and then I started taking
this into my daily life and I started realized like I started learning so much about how my
mind works how my body works and how everything is working just from connecting with my breath
because connecting with your breath connects with yourself and you can't understand anyone else until
you first understand yourself so your level of understanding of other people is just the level
of understanding of yourself you know if you understand yourself on such a shallow level
you won't really be able to understand another human being right you know so then I just started
understand myself more and then understanding other people more and then understanding how the
world works and yeah you know and I'm still learning every day like you know I'm not saying
like yo I figured all you know yeah for sure I'm not saying I figured all this shit out but
I'm figuring shit out every day from just connecting with my breath and just stopping
and being the student of life you know like every single day every experience that happens
is an opportunity to learn to help you to learn and to grow and evolve to your best self and
you know the more you you can do that the more you can help out the people you care about
how often and how long for it how long do you meditate for and how often you do it um now then
or like currently right now so currently I wake up every day and I like to hit a 15 minute timer
okay you know so usually one of the first things I do in the morning is I I like to get blood and
oxygen and blood flow moving throughout my body yeah so I'll do some sort of breathing and some
sort of movement therapy so I like to set a timer for 15 minutes I said okay this is just
15 minutes I'm going to use to connect with my breath and to be present you know and to just
connect yeah and I'll usually do about three to four rounds of Wim Hof and then just regular
can you know noticing my breath until the timer goes off yeah sometimes I'll be doing
Wim Hof breathing until the timer goes off okay sometimes I'll only do two rounds and just
sit there and regular meditate till the timer goes off yeah but I just have to give myself that
15 minutes and then a lot of times I like to do a second session too in the afternoon or okay at
night like if it's with friends yeah like um a lot of my friends are pro athletes as well okay and I
got all of them doing this do you really do they do it like yeah like they when you do it and you
feel it you get it like dude your body goes to a whole different place and like you know the longer
that you're holding your breath do the deeper you're able to go into your brainstem like you're
able to really activate that fight or flight to where your body can fight off the disease fight off
that infant inflammation and like dude and the more I started doing this like the more I started
being able to control what was going on like okay controlling my moods to my immune system to my
body yeah like I got to the point where I was doing it so much I could just lay there and
with my mind I mean call me crazy but I can consciously feel my inflammation draining
through my body wow you know just laying down and doing a certain type of breathing and and
putting my mind to it I can feel the inflammation draining through my nasal right into my lymphatic
system and then I could just pop my ears wow drain it back down and like I learn all this
from my breath yeah like all the answers that we search for like we're all looking for something
you know like all the answers that we search for are within us we already know everything yeah we
just don't we're just so distracted by all the outside you don't listen to our bodies that that
we're not listening you know but all the answers are within us we just have to stop and connect
that's why I love fucking talking to people like you man because so many people are just
not worried about that kind of stuff they're not worried about how to get better or fix themselves
or how to eat better or how to and a side of that yeah it's what I said and then a side of that is
selfish selfish yeah yeah because if you're not wanting to get the most out of yourself like
how are you contributing right you know what I mean like it doesn't matter what team you're on
if that's your family if that's your co-workers if that you're right you know if that's your friends
like you know the better you make yourself the better you can help and contribute exactly whatever
team you're on right you know so like I believe to not work on bettering yourself every day is selfish
you know like for sure yeah and and you can't really help other people until you can truly help
yourself I think too once you learn how to truly help yourself and you and you really understand
yourself you know and that was something that I learned through all this like I realized
before all these injuries I was putting all this in and trying to make myself great
then I realized fuck that was the wrong way to do this you know then I started realizing that the
more you know like if I wanted to be loved and valued I had to bring value you know I'm saying
yeah so then I started realizing that you know the more I help other people then the fucking
better I felt you know what I mean yeah I believe that the most selfish thing that you can do is help
out you know the people around you for sure definitely um I was going somewhere else with
that but I want to say the same the same thing with eating too like what not only like about
breathing but with eating what you eat is honest is truly what you are you're you're made up of
what you eat bro they're finding so many different connections with your gut from your yeah dude your
gut is connected to everything it's like our brain you know I think I don't remember who it was but
it's like another brain I should say yeah no yeah it is they're saying that your gut is definitely
like your second brain yeah they asked this guy somewhere in Asia who was like the oldest person
ever recorded living and I forget fucking how old I think it was he lived like 120 maybe and they
asked him like his last interview before he died like what's your secret right and he goes uh
take care of your gut the first half of your life so that your gut will take care of you the
second half of your life that's that hit that's it that hit hard because for me the first half I'm
fucking half my life's almost over I'm 30 years old and I've never gave it I never gave a shit
about taking care of my my gut or thought about what I ate yeah you know that's what got me into
my whole yard project like yeah it's oh yeah your your fucking yard is full of what you eat you eat
everything out of your own yard yeah yeah so like dude so like what's crazy is they're finding out
that like our gut microorganisms and our gut microbiome is so connected to our soil
and like it actually works almost the exact same way so like we have all these so for example a lot
of people thought that okay if you eat a vegetable then your body absorbs those nutrients and the
vegetables and that's how we get healthy and just like in trees they thought okay the roots of the
trees absorb the nutrients in the soil and that's what makes the tree it's not the case it's actually
based on like millions upon billions and billions of like microorganisms of like fungi of like this
microbiome that works as like a network that that has this perfect relationship that breaks down the
food and feeds it to whatever we need it just like in the soil and and I learned so much from
just watching my yard grow about how my own gut works and about how everything is aligned with it
and the more that we can eat in a line with our gut the better everything will connect so for example
we are eating so much of this industrial food from these industrial monocrops where yeah you have
like a certain vegetable or a certain fruit grown in like tens of acres with just a bunch of that
and no ability to connect to other plants or animals because they spray it with a bunch of
shit too yeah and that's what not only with vegetables obviously like factory farming with
that's even worse but the vegetables in the same way it's terrible dude and this shit wasn't around
in the 70s I don't think I don't think it was as nearly as bad as it is now I think it started I don't
know maybe like the 40s or 50s when they started like industrial farming that's pretty much when
everything started going to shit like dude cancer went up like ass burgers like yeah to dementia
dude all that stuff started going up because all this toxic pretty much the way that we're growing
food you know the way that we're growing our food is killing us and our planet yeah like 100%
and and when I started to wanting to heal my body I started to just start researching like what is
the best nutrients I can have you know like how am I supposed to eat to heal my body and it just
kept coming down to of course like you know the most organic and the more naturally it's grown
like eating from the earth you know like so are you are you vegetarian vegan meat you eat meat
okay yeah yeah okay I love a nice what's your what's your diet like like what what is your diet
considered like what's the balance um so the balance is I like to break my fast every day
with a super smoothie okay and that is pretty much where I just take a blender and I blend up as much
of the most nutrient dense foods I can find okay if that's from my yard from the grocery store
whatever's in season you know and dude and that gets my gut happy dude that helps all the all the
bad shit that I'm going to do you know I'm saying because yeah like I'm a strong believer is I don't
want to fight all the bad shit you know what I mean because that becomes a hard battle to battle
against of this temptation of oh I can't ever have chocolate again right right I fucking love
chocolate yeah but what I'm going to focus on is just doing the good so I just to start my day
with as much nourishment as possible because most of us are overfed and malnourished so let's
you know instead of fighting all the good foods that are all around us let's start with just nourishing
ourselves so that's what I like to do is um I source the best fruits and vegetables I can find
that's halfway convenient and I blend it up and I'll break my fast with that and then it depends
on my day or like how I'm training but um usually like sweet potatoes a bunch of vegetables you know
as like I really try to eat as much vegetables as I possibly can right and then I'll take my
carbohydrates like sweet potatoes or or fruits um based on how much energy I'm going to be giving
out yeah it's different for when you're doing high intensity shit like BMX yeah exactly but pretty
much do like the main thing with my diet is I like to have that super smoothie to make sure that
I'm just properly nourished okay and and then I just all vegetables and that smoothie it's just
like a lot of fruits and vegetables fruits and vegetables like spinach kale blueberries
yeah bananas avocados carrots um dude I got haranga a katuk that's from my yard like dude
you were saying you were saying something that you had like some ice cream flavored bananas or
some shit ice cream flavored bananas how the hell did you get that um just like I've never even heard
of that so just how there's like a hundred different varieties of apples you know there's
like granny's yeah yeah dude there's hundreds of different varieties of oranges there's hundreds
of different mangoes bananas okay dude there's hundreds of different strains of weed just like
different strains of yeah every plant on this earth dude I need some fucking ice cream flavored
bananas asap I got yo I got bananas that taste like apples and and the most beautiful thing about
bananas is so you have one banana plant right yeah you plant the one banana plant if it's happy
nine months it's going to give you a rack of some fruits yeah and four other banana plants
really yeah so you cut down the one that just gave you a rack now you got four other banana
plants to put over your yard to give to a friend to sell whatever so dude I started with like
three or four different banana plants that were four different varieties now I got just a whole
border of the whole border of bananas where it's like constantly have one I always have bananas
did you have you ever made like any kind of video on like how you made your your garden that you have
or you grow everything dude um because I want to learn how to I want to do that I need to figure
that out dude so the main thing is soil just the soil dude like everything can like dude we live in
st p florida like yeah it's beautiful weather year round like everything wants to grow the hardest
part about growing here is just the soil so if you build the soil everything dude all you gotta do is
just plant whatever you want it to grow really and building the soil is so easy it's free and easy
all you gotta do is call your local tree companies and ask for them to drop off their wood chips their
mulch and that's what breaks down into the best soil the best dirt so just the mulch yeah yeah just
so for example if you go into these forests yeah every fall every autumn what happens all the sticks
and the leaves they fall yeah and then that's what makes that hummus that um that micro biome that
fungus right underneath that's what breaks down into the soil okay so when you go to like you know
the northwest like washington state you know that has like the biggest trees and the biggest forest
and if you go and they have this most beautiful soil and it's just from years of like dude it takes
like a hundred years for a forest to build like an inch of really good top soil and all that is
is from the sticks and leaves falling okay you know what I mean okay you know and of course like
there's the nutrients from the animals dying on it right yeah for sure you know like the animals
like pissing on it or whatever but the bulk of it is what breaks down from the trees right and if
you call a local tree company who are like trimming up the oak trees so the oak trees are a pioneer
species they've been dialing in this climate this soil everything in this environment for hundreds
of years or for how long florida has been around yeah right so then when you break down that tree
and cut it into wood chips that's what breaks down into that perfect soil that's gonna perfectly
help your plants in this climate in this environment okay and that's what's gonna align that kind of
like your gut that gut microbiome with everything that's gonna help feed all your plants and give
it that internet system where it can communicate with so you don't actually use dirt you just put
the wood chips down and then how long does that take to turn into soil wood chips break down into
dirt how long does that take in florida once like two months of summer really yeah all right dude so
we laid like three four feet of mulch okay you know and then it broke down into like seven inches
of soil damn you know i'm saying and like bro we're constantly adding more mulch because it's
like mulch is the nourishment mulch is the energy you know so like you know mulch is one it's the
carbon too yeah you know so when you're putting that into the soil and that process of it breaking
down is what is the process that feeds all your plants okay and that's the soil and
yo our guts work the same way yeah yeah for sure 100 and that's what's crazy like and then when
we're eating the the foods from like you know the soil that is around us that's when our guts can
align with our environment we're not going to be struggling with allergies we don't get sick because
when the weather changes our gut changes you know and when our gut change like everything changes so
we're aligned with our environment so every time the weather changes it's not going to get us sick
right for sure um yeah and dude and it's crazy it sounds crazy but just putting your bare feet
or bare skin on that soil is what's going to help strengthen your immune system because
like dude we're all electric like all those neurons are rebalancing itself to like connect with
you know the microbiology in you in your gut is connecting with the microbiology in your soil
right that's so important just aligning ourselves with the earth and the more we're aligned with
the earth the healthier and happier we're going to be and do you so do you intermittent fast
or no yeah I mean every day dude like all the intermittent fasting is is going what 12 hours
without eating 12 13 14 hours like that yeah I do that all the time you know okay but dude if I wake up
I mean do you eat the smoothie for breakfast or do you wait do you skip that and wait till like
the afternoon like do you do it like at first thing in the morning so I'm not like super regiment
of like okay I gotta have this at 9 30 you know what I mean like bro it if I wake up on a Tuesday
and I got a big gym session that day and I want pancakes in the morning I'm gonna hit some pancakes
yeah and my roommate makes some bomb pancakes with the bananas that grow oh shit that's so good like
but but then again like if I wake up and I got a bunch of stuff to do and I just start doing it
and you know and that's when my mind feels like it's going to be working its best too is on an empty
stomach for sure you know I feel way sharper when I haven't eaten but then most people aren't like
that because their body just isn't used to it okay I'm saying so most people ride away oh I can't do
anything when I'm hungry that's what they think how hungry I am right but that's because that's
because their body just isn't used to being hungry okay and their relationship with being hungry
is a bad relationship it's a negative it's a negative thing yeah yeah yeah now every every
time I'm hungry I'm thinking about how my body is just healing itself feels good my mind's working
like I feel great so yeah like sometimes I wait till 11 to have this movie sometimes 12 sometimes
one I go by my schedule and how I'm feeling that day okay you know like everything's always changing
so it's hard to have a super strict routine and everything that's one thing that I learned from
you learn from nature and like watching my yard grow into its own like living ecosystem is like
everything on this planet is constantly changing and constantly creating you know it's creating
new leaves creating new feathers creating new sticks creating new something so when we create
we're aligning ourselves with nature yeah and everything is constantly changing like if I go
out in my backyard today it's going to be different than going to my backyard tomorrow
there's going to be different flowers different butterflies different different leaves you know
they sit differently they have their own dude they're alive yeah yeah right yeah you know what I'm
saying so then you know is the only thing that quits growing and quits creating is something
that's dying you know so I always thought about I've always wanted to do that first of all I've
always wanted to grow my own shit but it's way easier than you think I always think about it's
like I take so much upkeep and so much work dude that's how I would do it if you do it the way
like they teach you like okay you're gonna build a raised garden you're gonna plant your seeds in
the spring and harvest them in the fall it is a lot of work yeah there's a lot of work but but I'm
not doing that well how do you up how do you what's your upkeep like who up keeps the forest nobody
right the animals not not not even yeah because everything's in balance okay so all the trees
it's just balance it's in alignment so when you have a diverse of plants they take care of some so
for example if you're starting a company yeah and if you're wanting to start this big huge company
you have to resource other things to other people because you only have certain amount of strengths
you have to hire people who have strengths that are your weaknesses of course and then
in a company when you have the diverse of talents and diverse of skills that's a truly successful
company of course is the same way okay so the more you have a diverse of plants so for example
what we usually do is we have this monocrop so we have tens of acres of monocrop a monocrop is
how we grow all of our food okay so we have like acres on acres on acres of the same food okay
and it brings in balance it kills our soil it brings in balance and and that brings the pests
because the pest knows whoever pest likes that certain food is going to all be attracted to
that and then you got to spray chemicals to get rid of the pest and then the soil is getting shitty
so you got to spray fertilizer to get the plants right but when you grow like the forest it doesn't
really do that because there's a variety yeah because there's such a variety right so if a pest
comes in the other plant brings a pest that eats that pest so nothing makes sense goes crazy and then
if something else needs a nutrient or something's low on nutrient it has that that fungus network
under the internet that communicates and that transfers these nutrients yeah and like it all
works together and and one is I'm planting plants that that are perennials so an annual is like
something that you plant in the spring and then harvest in the fall a perennial is like an apple
tree an orange tree you plant it once and it lives a whole lifetime it grows for 30 years 50 years
a hundred whatever you know like there's some plants that may only live for five years so most
of your plants are perennials yeah pretty much all of them so wow so what I did is I just focused
on the soil I laid the mold and then every time I have spared like fruits or vegetable scraps I add
that in to the soil to compost it really oh shit you just throw them in there yeah dude everything
that's like biomass like every stick every leaf every eggshell every like bro that's all something
that feeds the earth soil yeah like makes that no makes sense like every scrap of leaf or broccoli
that all breaks down into nutrients for the soil that feeds our planet and we are extracting all
this energy all these nutrients into this low quality food and that's why like yeah we're sick the
planet's sick but when you have really rich soil then the food that's growing is rich with nutrients
and then when you consume that then you're rich with life right you know dude what was I listening
to yesterday I was listening to something the other day they were talking about how um they kill
they hunted this bear this black bear that all it was all it ate was blackberries some some bear
that all it ate was fucking was uh blackberries or blueberries some some dark berry and when they
cut it open they filleted it open and they cut its meat it was just this dark stained purple
and they were thinking it was because of the fucking berries today all the thing ate was berries
that's and they were trying to correlate it back to like what you you are what you eat yeah you know
what I mean it was just super interesting for sure but they're finding like dude all of our health
is based on our gut flora you know what I mean flora so like so when you think of your gut all
those organisms like you want to think of like a beautiful forest or a beautiful park with all of
the diversity right the diversity of the plants the diversity of the animals you know like you
have a beautiful lake you have the fish in the lake you have the squirrels you got the birds you
have the big plants you got the bushes you have the vines you have the beautiful life and that
and that diversity is what's going to bring that balance that strength of like why um just like
our stomach like why I won't need a doctor to maintain my health it's just like I won't need to
tend to my garden right you know what I mean like it's the same thing like it's in balance so
everything does pretty good at taking care of itself and then if something like if some problem
does show up you stop you observe you learn from it and you evolve and you keep going
that's strong I need to uh get my fucking garden going asap dude it's so easy the first thing you
do call a tree company ask them can you dump off a load of mulch because that's the best thing that
you could do is start building your soil okay and then second step you know the flea market on park
yeah they sell so many awesome trees dude awesome plants awesome but bushes hell yeah you'll have
all these Thai people showing you fruits you never even heard dude dude we got jackfruit you
have heard of jackfruit yeah I have heard of jackfruit they're the fucking pointy ones right
dude the spikes on them it's bigger than a basketball right it dude it's the biggest like
tree-grown tree-born fruit on the planet I had no fucking idea it was that big they get like 50 60 70
sometimes 80 pounds what and they taste like juicy fruit they say it's what the guy like how he got
the flavor of juicy fruit is from a jackfruit really yeah but dude they're using it to like
help world hunger because it's dude it's so much food and you can because it'll feed so many one
fucking fruit will feed a ton of people right crazy crazy and that's wild bro if you shred it up
cook it and put some barbecue sauce on it tastes just like a whole pork you fucking crazy motherfucker
no no no that's insane dude I've never I'm not a cook okay so I've never specifically done it
okay that's what they tell you dude like they use it for like a meat substitute all the time do you
have a jackfruit I got two jackfruit do you wow but it has they haven't started fruiting yet I think
my one jackfruit will start fruiting next year and that's something that like what makes people a
little bit resistance to do it is because this type of patience thinking you know is like an
investment you know I'm saying like you lay all this mulch and you plant all these plants for
fruits that are going to bear maybe in two years maybe three years that doesn't fit in with our
culture bro yeah we want it now man I want the insta I want instagram I want to swipe and get it now
yeah yeah but then but I think eventually when people keep learning of you know a better way
to grow our food eventually it's going to be that way to where you can just okay I want an apple
and you swipe it and then this fresh grown apple is going to be right at your door right I mean
is it really going to be a fresh grown apple it's going to be fucked up modified in some kind of
way I mean I think people have to I think people have to change though I think I think culture's
gotten to a point where it's just it's gotta the pendulum's gotta swing people gotta learn to be
like people gotta learn to be patient yeah they gotta learn that mindset of investing for long-term
returns you know long whether it be with finance or your body whatever it is it's a whole different
way of thinking dude you're so right and like I mean and the only way to start that is with us
you know like we have to lead by that example yeah we have to do the best we can so then other
people will you know hopefully see that and catch on to that and there's always going to be people
who don't give a fuck and those are the people who are just going to most likely be consuming
you know like they are the consumers yeah they're just consuming things all day without
much producing and there and there's so many people that are just fucking blind to it and
they don't even take the second to even stop and think they're just it's that guy it's that
fucking person speeding down the road trying to get to the grocery store on time that's fucking
you know flipping you the bird going through the light because they're pissed off at themselves
they hate their lives yeah I've been that guy yeah right so a lot just fucking angry to everybody
you fucking didn't stop at the stop sign I'm pissed off they're feeling their own suffering
of course they don't even they don't get it though they just want to blame it on everybody
else you always get like what you made you know I'm saying like like you get what you put in if
you put out a bunch of bad energy you're gonna feel like shit you know and that's something I
had to learn I guess the hard way let's talk about the stem cell shit dude how did you get so
stem cells healed your knees basically okay or how did you first explain tell the story of how
you first got into stem cell so the knee exploded yeah right the knee exploded that was in the summertime
I started doing the breathing I started changing my life I started reading like bro I never read
books before because I couldn't sit down long enough to fucking read a book dude I started
reading non dude my whole life changed you gotta have a body harder than a shield and a mind
sharper than a blade so I began sharpening my saw there you go I mean like pencily physically
emotionally and then and the fucking knee dude for the last six months of it dude I didn't realize
how broken the leg was but they were just giving me quarter zone shots and I was actually finishing
the season and like dude I was riding with this broken femur and so much pain just causing so much
more damage from my whole entire body but I was breathing through all this like learning about
dude I was learning so much through all of this like just and then they finally went in and said
look we gotta fix this thing so they did this micro fracture surgery which I kind of regret doing
at this micro fracture surgery so essentially they took a drill and they exploded the rest of my knee
and and broke everything the pieces in hopes that it's going to regrow back and then same thing
like me um I was supposed to like stay off it for like six months I started racing and training
in like three and I went to this race in Paris and dude it was awful dude I couldn't even walk
through the airport without pain where I was just like dude this pain was not going away but I also
wasn't stopping my training yet you know like I started changing everything in my life but it was
one habit after another you know I did the fast I was doing the breathing and that's when I started
realizing that hey I gotta stop living for myself and start living for other people and then when
I went to Europe that's when that's what got me in the video of like look if like I created this
whole plan of like how I'm gonna use what I have to keep evolving what I have and to use that to
help and to contribute to the world and one thing I understood was video so I just like dude I didn't
know how to get my computer on the internet I didn't know how to check emails I didn't know
how to work a camera but I told myself dude I'm going all in on video you know like I'm gonna
learn how to do this and start making videos I'm gonna take everything that I'm doing that's helping
me and create it into some content that can help other people document it right exactly and I'm
gonna keep pushing myself to keep learnings and the more I learn the more I can video to help
other people and if I'm running out of material to create then I'm not pushing myself enough right
you know so then but then dude my knee do my like my whole body was starting to feel great but this
pain in my knee just wasn't going away you know like it kept telling me look that pain I have more
to learn I haven't learned my lesson quite yet so then somebody I knew talked to somebody who
did stem cells my manager brought me in and I met the guy and I said dude I got nothing to lose man
dude let's try this stem cell and then I did the stem cells and that's when he gave me like look you
can't you can't do nothing dude if you really want this to heal you can't leave your house for like
eight nine months so where did you end up getting the stem cell therapy I mean I know from Dr.
Locke's right there in Clearwater oh really yeah I thought last time I talked to somebody who did
that they were going to Mexico and doing it yeah yeah that's dude I think that's a whole different
like they're getting I like I know there's different types of stem cells okay like the stem
cell that I used was actually from my own body like I'm a young healthy person did they took it
like straight from like my for people who don't know explain what exactly what is what is stem
what is a stem cell so we all have these kind of like stem cells in our body those are the guys
that are in your body working at healing and rebuilding cells and regenerating shit right
they're like super construction workers right you know that always helping to heal your body
and we we have those all throughout our body and we have a lot of it like in our pelvis you know
like of course where that energy system is like right into right our main part of our whole body
and they can harvest them straight from there and they inject it right into the trouble spot and it's
like injecting these super construction workers to help rebuild all the shit that's going wow
all the shit that went wrong how do they extract specifically the stem cells a big ass needle in
it what bro so like the first time like it was all like a steroid needle fucking big bigger really
like this big what yeah like two feet long I don't know maybe it was a foot I don't know it looked
big damn dude yeah yeah but like the first time I was numb I didn't feel it but I did two sessions
and the second time I don't know if he missed the numbing or he went deeper or like what happened
but I mean I've never been raped but the dude I felt like dude no loom my skin went white like
dude I'm like like it felt like there was something somewhere it shouldn't be you know what I'm saying
because it's like deep like and they go in and from like your lower back but they pull it out and
they put it right in my knee and I'll be 100% honest it did help but it didn't heal my knee
really it didn't heal my knee because because check this out if you have any problem right
and if you have that problem of whatever caused that problem but if you just go to a doctor and
they give you this pill or this surgery or whatever that's going to help with that problem if you
don't fix or understand what originally caused that problem to begin with that problem is just
going to come back in two to three years in however right there's no just like miracle
that's going to happen so for example yeah if I had these joint pains in my body all right so say
if you go to get stem cells because you have a bad shoulder or if you have a bad knee right
those stem cells will inject these super construction workers in your body to help rebuild your
shit right but if you keep using your shoulder or your knee in the exact same way a long term the
exact same she's going to happen you're gonna have to happen over yeah yeah exactly so so this pain
in your body is meant to be learned from that's your body trying to speak to you that's your body
screaming so stop and try to listen what it's trying to say and and that's what I did because
dude I was stuck in my house for almost a year where like I was dude I was like he put me on a
step counter right I had four thousand steps a day it was pretty much just enough to wake up
piss shit feed myself walk in the backyard breathe and meditate and four thousand steps yeah like it
if I went to the grocery store and got food I would go over my steps and I would be in a
lot of pain damn so dude I was stuck in my house for like almost a year bro of just like
just breathing watching my yard grow you know because everything was already planted just
breathing in my yard watching it grow reading book after book after book and then I got this
sketchbook and I started creating this plan of like oh when I can walk again you know because
there was a time where these doctors were telling me I was never going to be able to like
walk or run or jump again without pain you know so I started just creating this whole plan of like
you know hey this is my second chance dude of like this realizing it's not all about me
but what can I use what I have to help other people yeah and then so I started changing
everything from the way I thought from the way I moved and changing the way I moved and changing
the way I thought is really what did it so they injected these stem cells into your knee
and what was the pro like what did you have to do after that like what well what did the stem
cells actually do like how did that help so all right so check this out so for most people
they go in they get the stem cells injected in like a week or two they're feeling fucking great
right right because they're sitting at their desk all day you know they're not doing much but
I don't want a normal life dude I want to be extraordinary dude like I wanted to have that
extra of like I plan on going back and racing professionally you know I'm saying right and
that was my goal and still is you know to race professionally on my bike and then not only be
a professional athlete now but when I'm 50 I want to be climbing fucking mountains my dude hell yeah
you know I'm saying like who doesn't yeah exactly that's your problem if you're not thinking that way
then I want to be as physically fit as possible like being able to use my body and use my mind
till the end and I knew if I didn't change everything right then from changing from the way
moved from the way I thought then I wasn't going to have that and then I mean I mean I started
meeting with like the smartest physical therapist I could find and like finding like there's these
guys from California called move you who are like the smartest people I ever find of just like
teaching you how to move and use your body properly move you move you okay like m o v e then the
letter you like they worked with Antonio Brown when he got hurt but really dude they were doctors
like physical therapists chiropractors dude they did everything and they realized oh it's not
fucking healing people it's not working like it's just a bullshit trying to sell you this
procedure that it's just gonna put you in the same place yeah so this program like literally
teaches you how to breathe how to use your shoulder how to use your body and gives you
all these exercises to realign everything and like I tell anyone if they have any back pain
or shoulder pain or knee pain to check out these guys because like that's interesting
that was stronger than the stem cells really because it well it changed the way I moved
you know what I mean like it taught me to connect with myself and to connect with my movement to
be aware of how I was using my body of what was bringing me to this pain of what was causing my
shit to break down and if it's breaking down it means it's not in alignment it's not in balance
so that program taught me how to like taught me what muscles were too tight and what muscles
were too weak and how to strengthen those muscles and how to move and use my body and how to
use my feet like I was never connected with my feet or my breath or anything like that right
but that's so important how did you learn how did you like digest the program did you go to
California or is it like something you download and uh so like they have like this web just move
you.com okay and they have videos and shit dude it's dude it's like the best program I've ever
seen dude and they're not paying me in any way like I actually paid them yeah right right right
that says a lot about them yeah dude and and I've I've listened and I've been studying fitness and
health my whole life right you know what I'm saying and like I haven't found anything almost as good
as these guys you know there's a guy named Edo Portal like have you ever heard of him no Edo
Portal like he's like the number one dude with movement you know okay Wim Hof is like the guy
with the breath and the ice and this guy is the guy with the movement okay but like move you these
guys are just teaching you how to fix your shit really you know because all of us are out of a
line we're having these yeah pains these shoulder pains these neck pains because we're just sitting
in cars sitting with this bad posture it's showing you that your posture and the way you sit and the
way you use your body in your daily movement it's not that this certain crash caused that injury that
might have been you know the like the camel that broke through or the straw yeah yeah right you know
but it's the everyday tiny little movements that chip away at our body yeah for sure that if we're
not using and moving our body properly then it's chipping instead of rehabilitating you know but
if we know how to use our body just like if we know how to use our minds then every movement
that we're doing becomes strengthening instead of like degenerating yeah I learned that recently
like with my fucking lower back that I've really like never you I don't use my core enough so I
like learned to like I've been doing like a lot of like different things to strengthen my core and
like I realized how that fucking changes your lower back that with like rolling out the legs and
shit I never like never thought about that dude I'm still doing this program today really like oh
dude because I have this time off with my current shoulder injury now yeah right I crashed like
a month ago yeah BMX going great got my knees healed you know jumping to the story like that's
crazy that you're being doing BMX for so long too yeah yeah dude and like after the move you and like
dude after like the physical therapy like I mean it's still do my knee it's just my one knee
it's still getting stronger every day but really it feels fucking amazing that's awesome dude dude it
just finally I can walk without pain I can jump I can dude and just like the past month or two I've
really been able to start running bro I haven't been able to run without pain in years really 23
bro like and now like I'm able to use my body so much more yeah dude the stem cells helped but the
move you is what taught me how to do it you know and now I'm waiting for this surgery to fix my
shoulder like I'm actually doing more of the program now to get my body ready to go into a
surgery how long do you think you're gonna do BMX for I'll probably be riding my bike till I can't
walk till I die man do you think there's any is there like a is there like a transition after I mean
obviously so so the BMX that we're we're talking about right now is is when you start on a big hill
and you basically go around like a motocross track yeah right let's look what you see in like like
dirt bike races but it's on a bicycle exactly have you ever thought about transitioning out of that
into a different kind of bike racing dude I'm a BMXer man I love that so you're stuck you're sticking
to that I love riding bikes dude and like I just love riding bikes man okay for sure um like like
what about like the fucking downhill shit where they're in the woods and they're like I'll do it
yeah I'll have you ever tried it um I have did a mountain bike race before it dude was fun like
I love bikes yeah I just love being outside hanging out with my friends yeah doing anything
like physically active you know I started BMX when I was younger and that's what got me hooked
you know I've been doing it forever and now like I have this new passion of just like you know the
art of mastery of just like falling in love with the process of learning new you know and then
after coming back like of this new reborn self is like I never enjoyed BMX more because before I
just started BMX because I was trying to make myself look cool yeah you know what I mean like
I only started BMX and continued to race BMX to make myself seem awesome and to be great and to
build up this ego of mine and then when I lost all that during those injuries now now I love BMX
more than ever because it's not you know I'm not doing it to look cool but I'm just falling in love
with the process of learning and bettering myself yeah you know it's not so much about
crushing the dude next to me but just bettering myself from yesterday yeah do you ever take any
mushrooms or DMT fuck yeah you do I mean you're talking about like the ego stuff and then everyone
talks about like I've never done DMT or mushrooms but uh I'm too much of a pussy so I've never done
DMT but but I mean I you know I had a couple mushrooms here yeah you know saying but like
when did you start doing that like was the first time you did it was it at what point in your
dude do the first time I ever did mushrooms was only like probably a year and a half ago really
a year ago yeah uh last time was last weekend dude I eat a fucking weed gummy and I'm fuck I feel
like I'm tripping on mushrooms dude those are all that's the best I love I love dude like all honestly
like I never even like smoked weed too much up until like all this started happening yeah you know
what I mean and then like you know I first started smoking a little bit of weed and then all of a
sudden like I started feeling my body a little bit more to where like dude I got these tight muscles
that's where all this pain is coming from and then but really like nothing has been better than the
breathing really like because I can get to these higher states with my breath we all can yeah we
all can get to these higher states with our breath and like go into such a deeper part get all those
lights and get all that craziness just with our breath and the consistency of doing that every
single day is what helped me you know but like you know maybe one day on mushrooms is good yeah
a nice glimpse of what's possible yeah right and like it just I remember like the first time I ate
mushrooms I got to really see how the whole environment is really connected how much did you take
not enough do you remember how many grams it was maybe three three yeah okay I'm trying to figure
out for my first time I do it you know but I mean like there's a couple times you know I threw like
a gram or so in them super smoothies oh yeah having a good day yeah they talk about a lot of people
talk about micro dosing like especially like in Silicon Valley how those guys they micro dose on
lsd and mushrooms so much yeah because you're building all these crazy connections yeah like
you're able to lower your ego and your ego just gets in the way and it makes you think in all of
this like separateness and your somebody-ness you know but when you're on like mushrooms or even weed
it helps to diminish your ego so you can see how everything is just really one and we're all connected
and we're all in this together yeah you know what I mean like like just how we have like billions of
different organisms in our body we are just one of those billions of different organisms in the
earth body right we're all sitting here trying to work towards the same goal of the health and
happiness of this earth in this plane you know I'm saying like we just may not realize it but
we're all looking for the same thing yeah we're all looking for the same thing and it's all connected
yeah so it's like it's fucking sweet that is fucking sweet dude you know it's not like I'm telling
you to go out there and do some mushrooms but sometimes it helps dude like but go out there and
do some mushroom yeah like dude I hear people they're using mushrooms for everything now dude oh
yeah I'm really starting to think mush and I'm not talking about just it's it's legal in Colorado
right dude they're using like the psychedelic mushrooms to help with like PTSD addiction oh
yeah that stuff for sure you're able to drop your old self and to just build these new connections but
like not not just psychedelic mushrooms fungus and mushroom itself is like I I believe there's so
much more to it than we believe like we're realizing that dude the biggest living organism that we've
ever found on this planet is a microbiome like you know like a fungus network in the northwest
from like you know Canada all the way down to northern California you know that whole forest
yeah it's just one big microorganism of this fungi network of you know what I was talking about
earlier that microbiome and that's like they're finding that everything is kind of like the start
and the end for mushrooms right and if you look at mushrooms like in a forest it's kind of like the
portal to break down what's dying to feed to life that's coming yeah you know and then when I take
mushrooms like even the psychedelic ones I kind of feel like it's breaking down all that dead waste
yeah to bring room for a new life in my mind and even like the regular like portobello
mushrooms that you eat you know they help break down the old shit in your body the you know they
help with your brain health yeah I'm not talking about the psychedelics like just the regular yeah
yeah yeah I wanted you by the grocery store yeah yeah exactly I think mushrooms is definitely
something that humans are just beginning to scratch the surface of untapping the potential of what
we do like I think we can replace plastic concrete everything with mushrooms you know like everything
that we're using and making that's kind of killing the planet from like what we build our houses with
from like all the plastic like I think if I think the technology is far like not quite there yet
but it's possible to use like some sort of the fungus family to do everything that we need yeah
because it's way more advanced than we are I did one of those float tank things yesterday
yesterday for the first time ever sweet how was the first time in my life it was cool it wasn't
like one of the legit float tanks it was one in st pete and it wasn't like because it wasn't one of
those like round orbs they're like oh yeah it's bigger it's kind of like a big shower but it gets
pitch black and they put a thousand pounds of epsom salt in there and I felt really great but
um it was pitch black and I wish I would have fucking ate a weed gummy first dude I ate when I
did it I ate a big brownie and nothing well I think it'd be better just to go in there normal
really honestly yeah see I did it normal and I felt like it could have been cooler do it again
maybe I try both yeah I'm gonna try but I'm definitely gonna try and both but um it was
definitely a good experience I mean I mean I needed like the salt bath either way like I
needed I had so much fucking like like lactic acid and shit built up on my enemy that I need I just
needed that just to get those toxins out but um it was definitely a cool experience yeah for sure
I definitely want to try it again dude and it's so cool I like you know the more people are like
struggling with certain things you know the more people are creating new opportunities to help with
that you know what I mean like there's all the things that are starting to coming and becoming
more popular from float tanks from yoga to meditation tour like in the 90s if you talked
about meditation you were like crazy right or who's this guy what are you like a Buddhist or
something right but now like because so many of us are struggling with these mental health issues
to like now meditation is getting popular it's kind of it's definitely cool now meditation and
yoga has definitely gotten a lot cooler a lot more accepted in the mainstream yeah let's do it
it should be too it's working yeah dude it's working and it's making us feel better happier
healthier stronger and dude the more happier healthier stronger one of us is the more happier
healthier stronger we all can be it's funny I was having just a talk yesterday with this lady at
youtube who I talked to every once in a while like that talks about like how to like to optimize
like your channel or try to like you know help you grow your channel more and with like the content
that you're creating and she helps like strategize different shows like different like types of
content that I make or whatever and how we optimize it and uh we were talking about cpm's you know
like cpm based on like your video so cpm's it's cost per milli basically it's like your ad revenue
per thousand views of your content so every thousand views you can make x amount of dollars
based on the amount of revenue you make from youtube and I was asking like what's the highest
because obviously there's different types of content that make more money because certain
advertisers will target that type of content yeah like well there's health there's lots of
different like categories I think one of the biggest ones is like the makeup tutorials because
it's so easy for those companies and I was asking her I'm like what's the the highest paying cpm out
of all the types of content that you've noticed or like the top category that makes the highest
amount of ad revenue and she was saying that it's like personal finance gurus people that teach
finance or like teach wealth that kind of shit like person people that are looking to get rich
and I was like what the fuck and because I have real I've noticed just so many people out there
especially on the internet that are like trying to be gurus of like finance or personal wealth
that that aren't 21 years old living their mama's basement yeah well not necessarily that but they
fucking they just create content about that because they know it's what the culture wants you know
I mean they're not doing it because that's what they're good at or that's what they've done their
whole life they're doing it's kind of just like a a degenerative cycle of they're creating that
kind of entertainment because it know it they know it makes money and that kind of reinforces
what's in the culture people just want it they want to chase money they see somebody with a
fancy fucking car see somebody with the Lamborghini or a big house think oh my god I want to be just
like this person you know I mean it's like a it's something that's in our culture right now
that reflects but I think like onto the internet people who consume their thinking and their energy
with that they get theirs you know I'm saying like like it's kind of what we're talking about
before is like yeah people who consume their thinking in like not in good alignment if it's
just out of alignment or in a place they're miserable you know I'm saying like you you know
when something when someone is firing on all cylinders they feel good they're happy they're
nice you know I mean yeah nice to people they have a good energy yeah for sure I'm saying like
and those and that's when we're gonna be at our most successful as well for sure yeah I don't know
I don't really know what the fuck I was getting at why I bring that up but I guess it it's very
relevant to like being lopsided in in what you're doing just like you said you could have a muscle
imbalanced somewhere but if you if you really focus on just fucking making that money getting that
dollar you know what I mean you're gonna you're gonna neglect so much other important shit it's
gonna bring pain you know what I mean in some way it's good it's gonna bring some pain or suffering
yeah if if you're just pursuing the money yeah like even if the pain is the disappointment of
because most of times if you're just pursuing the money you'll end up either broke or miserable
you know I'm saying right but then if you align making that money with some sort of value connecting
it with your specific strengths and like how you can create that value to contribute to the world
or having something that someone's gonna pay for you know it's obviously bringing value in some way
because money is just an exchange of value yeah you know I'm saying so if you can create something
with your gifts that someone actually wants to buy that's when you're gonna kind of have your
cake and eat it too where you know like the money falls into place if you just focus on bringing
the value with you know the things that you enjoy doing or the things you care about yeah definitely
tell everybody where they can like find you got a youtube channel you make a lot of content on
youtube yeah for sure so like that other than like pushing myself and penciline physically to try to
find my best self like I use most of my extra time and energy to like creating content and it's
all funneled really through my website so like my my instagram my twitter my youtube all of the
content that I create for that is also on my website which is www.vwillgrant.com but if you
just want to go to youtube or instagram or twitter just type in my name will grant and I should show
just www.willgrant.com to find all your stuff yes sir learn how to get better learn how to eat well
learn how to work out learn how to be fast absolutely let's push each other together to
find our best selves and create the best world we can I love it dude well thank you so much for
doing this and and uh dude thanks for having me letting my audience absorb what you have to uh
what you have to give and let's definitely do this shit again dude this was awesome sounds good
man oh yeah bro so much
