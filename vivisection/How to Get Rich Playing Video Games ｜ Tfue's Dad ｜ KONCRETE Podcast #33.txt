it's so nice to see you it's nice to see you dick how have you been pleasure this
young man is having a baby I'm very happy for him his lovely wife and he
are expecting any day now any day now she just went to the doctor today and
they found out she's one centimeter dilated whatever that means that means
it's closer than it was yesterday so how you been well I can answer any
questions about real estate or anything else also without the insults to Danny
and the verbiage of ridiculousness people think they're gonna miss Ben or he
asked me anything about any subject and if I know something I'll tell you if I
don't I don't BS and say oh I know about that well it's such a breath of fresh
air to not have him sitting here fucking breathing down my neck don't you
agree oh well I I don't do this so yeah I would have left a long time ago so what
the fuck have you been up to you've been you live a crazy life it's gonna like I
saw you on the beach on the 4th of July and you were basically like wrangling
cattle with all those kids he was like running around with Jack and all his
friends Turner and all his friends and they were lighting off fireworks and
you were just in the middle of like a tornado it's that every day I mean it's
kind of like living the Truman show oh fix your mic get your mic a little bit
closer so like see how like it's about like two inches from my mouth you had
that short fat man here so yeah yeah this guy was big no actually the last one
this Jimmy Hart was sitting there a couple days ago sorry I interrupted no
it's simple that it you have a kid streaming yeah all the time all night
and I have a you should have it here on air like says on air should get one of
those a blue on the air like did you get that for him yeah so that people wouldn't
just walk in his room a little bit closer with the mic sorry more you can
just hot you can just freaking force it up yeah there you go can you hear me
yeah yeah we gotta get that that good ASMR so Turner's in there streaming and I
hear him he plays horns yeah like ox horns and all these weird things and
yelling but you unless you're watching on twitch it's a bizarre thing cuz I'm in
there working and I'm hearing this screaming and I don't know what he's
talking about and then Jack is shooting videos and editing all the time but we
live on the beach so we have all always have a lot of activities there and it's
actually quieter and it used to be when they were smaller in their teens we'd
have 30 40 kids a night walking around driving me nuts so this has been like
the vacation time so what is it that did they kick you out of the house where do
you where do you stay four bedrooms and then we have a room we have a bedroom
outside so they kicked you outside are you living in the shed I know but I have
Turner's bought a new house so he'll be did he yeah we're at I can't say well
give me like a general idea don't give me the address come on it's on the the the
mainland side of the intercoastal okay you got a place to park the new jet skis
yeah I mean it's a beautiful house and he got a great buy on it guys he knocked
them down quite a bit of money it makes a difference they love my Mike close they
want to close wow so he bought a new house huh yeah did you help him did you
help him negotiate that deal or did he do that on so yeah no he doesn't have time
he doesn't do nothing he doesn't he does not have time I mean we got New York
Times wants to do an interview and the guy's like I go I can't I can't I can't
get him right he gets up he eats Mike go and get something he comes back does
some stuff he's back online he doesn't leave the house rarely rarely I mean to
eat but I mean he's a people that tell me well I wish I could do this and I wish
I could do that here's the point if you're going to do something then do it all
the time right he does it seven days a week he did it for probably two years
and he was making my three dollars an hour two dollars an hour and he never
complained right you know I hear people I eat my job well no you hate what you
picked you picked it nobody nobody in America is made to take a job you choose
it whether it's McDonald's or Burger King or Publix Publix or whatever but to go
back to real estate to all those people watching Turner is in real estate right
well he's a big real estate he bought a giant warehouse and a nice house but I
met a guy about 15 years ago was working at the Kentucky Fried Chicken and I
would come through and he'd always talk to me and then one day he said I'm
retiring I said how can you retire he said I've worked three minimum wage jobs
for the last 20 years and he owned eight duplexes and he bought them all from he
never went to management he was a minimum wage but he took his money and
built an empire really and was able to retire so don't tell me I can't do it
it's a matter of giving up your playing and your free time to work this guy had
given up all his free time so he could work and three minimum wage jobs and he
was able to buy eight duplexes so it's possible for anyone how long did he have
to work at KFC to afford eight duplexes worked there 25 30 years shit but he
worked there he worked at like Taco Bell and Burger King it's three different
low-wage jobs I mean in those days it was probably 450 550 an hour now there
I went somewhere yesterday and it was $19 an hour well you can make money if you
work now do you think that he the whole time you worked that he planned to this
is what his plan was the whole time to buy real estate and retire are you
saying that like that's that I would say that somewhere along the line he made
the decision to buy his first duplex right and then he just added to it right
right right thing but I mean that is one of the most incredible stories I've
ever heard of a of a low-income person so it is possible now if you got three
kids yeah right I had four so maybe you can give some good parenting advice to
people out there who are having kids you raise a couple phenoms well none of
them went to school ever four kids no school why what for that's what everyone
does it's just what you're supposed to do right well your kids grow up and they
go to school well that's that's if you want them to be the cookie cutter kids
and in today's world I don't want I wouldn't want kids in school because
they're getting there they're probably through the third or fourth grade to get
educated and then after that it's all about who you know what you know what you
wear what drugs are available I mean I talk to kids all the time there's drug
dealers in every school they know who they are and I'm like and then you go by
the schools and there was fences and and you know guards this girl said to me
something yesterday she was she the housekeeper that I have once a week don't
think I'm rich guys she cost me $50 for two hours and her daughter her daughter
was there and she and she was talking about school and said have you ever
heard of kids going in and shooting up restaurants or grocery stores I said why
do kids go and shoot at schools because they hate school hello right so that's
where the problem is and that the system says well the way we're going to deal
with it we're gonna put more people in there with guns like that's probably not
a good idea right maybe they need to look at the way they deal with children
and education as the problem see here's what I thought all along so is this the
main motivation for you not putting your kids through traditional public
schools is that the main reason that you didn't do that the main reason was I
wanted to raise the best Fortnite player of course and it worked like a
fucking charm and he you know he was not allowed to play video games they
didn't have computers they didn't have phones yeah I would say go outside and
go play on the beach now I would keep an eye on when they're younger but it was
because I worked out of the house I was able to do that no one can do it I think
that the main motivation was is when I went to school after the sixth grade I
never learned a thing yeah I already was testing at a high school level and what
they do is they dumb it down the dumbest kid in the room is taught and you got to
sit there and listen to it over and over and over and I think the other problem
schools is it's all age grades so kids that are like when you get into high
school oh he's a freshman I'm a junior yeah I'm a senior and you're a lousy
and what it does is it gets this system ingrained in kids that younger is worse
if you're younger you're not as good yeah and they and fraternization with the
younger people well that's not just in school though is it I mean but that's
where I can order in where they learn my kids have you know they can go out with
somebody's 25 or 18 and they don't look at it the same way that other people do
don't you worry about social skills didn't you think about like maybe like
that's the one thing you think of when kids are homeschooled like they're not
gonna have proper social skills they're not gonna be able to interact with kids
deal with bullies they're gonna be able to be nervous to talk to a girl in the
hallway there's like all those different little things that people get when
they're in a public school you ever think about that I got those that my
friends all said that yeah right and the other one was I'll never have a job and
make money well Turner's got 25 million people on social media Jack's got 12
million so I would assume their social skills are pretty good now but they went
you know we went to parks every day we went to lived on the beach so it was a
public beach right it dealt with thousands of people they weren't we
weren't Amish hiding in the hills you know what I mean I mean that's really the
differences yeah yeah is if you actually are around people I mean I got people
when I sent them to tumbling when they were younger right like three four and
five it's like gymnastics yeah and my friends go that's not for boys and I go
okay Turner's jumping off 80 and 90 foot bridges now doing flips on YouTube so
you know there all the building blocks came to fruition Jack and Turner would
not be able to work for the two biggest companies in the world Google and
Amazon because neither has a high school education but they make a lot of money
from both right right and my daughter and my daughter's running a marketing for
a company called skinny mixers and their their growth is so phenomenal I told
the boys I think she might outdo you guys so the proof's in the pudding what
do you need school for yeah go through it well you're you're you're one case
though I mean how many Zuckerberg quit college Bill Gates quit college Stephen
Jobs went to one semester that that case closed in college though they all went
to high school and middle yeah but I guarantee you those guys after about six
or seventh grade they didn't even hear what the teacher was talking about as it
were too smart right see you could go online and educate yourself there are
people all the world now doing that they can go on this what's that Khan
Academy you're having trouble at school or you want to learn anything you want
to learn math you want to learn history go to Khan Academy yeah you can learn
anything on YouTube if no but Khan Academy takes you from the start because I
had one kid the youngest who was a little behind yeah so we started over we
started at first level and I got him up to high school level on about six weeks
okay on Khan Academy and then when I got into algebra I did not take it in
high school mm-hmm so I didn't know it but history it's all pretty simple it's
reading and learning right yeah I remember how the school system is set up
here's how it's set up now it's like a prison to me they got locked areas you
can't leave they lock the doors in your room and then someone comes in and goes
through the roll call I assume and then most of the kids this is what I hear
from kids yeah the kids are all on their phone in class so what does it mean to
go to school right right no yeah I agree it's a babysitter especially college
especially college with how expensive it is and well that's that's that's so
people can go into debt they can go and owe money to work it doesn't make any
sense it doesn't see 30 years ago you were told to go to college because you
needed it now because the economies and and opportunities are there you don't
need it that's why the four guys are three guys I mentioned they didn't
finish school because there was no sense in it right if you're gonna start your
own company then you definitely don't need no education yeah I know at 90%
people I know who went to college and got a degree are either a not working in
that field right now or B is still trying to find a job and across the board
I mean you can pretty much say by and large people who are like Ben or like you
know Ben didn't go to school right no he been dropped out of middle school I know
that's people who like that they always have stories of how they dropped out of
school they didn't finish school they just they found their own path there was
a song done in the 60s and they talked about about how it was just cookie cutter
what they and this is the biggest problem in America they don't allow you to
think they want to tell you how to think yeah weighed the way you should think
and they don't allow thinking anymore so if you're gonna go out and run a
business on your own and start something it's the worst place to be because
they're stifling you how so they're telling you how to think in business you
have to you have to you know you have to create something if you're told just to
do it this way and you got to do it that way right you can't think outside the
box you can't create right stifling innovation and and you know the way
people are talking is we want free college and free medical care and all
this stuff and I'm like well the why are you complaining about Russia you just
bring the Russian president over and or Chinese president that's what they do in
those countries yeah you do what they say and you there's no innovation there's
no business except the state and I don't see that as an advantage right we
wouldn't have rap music then they don't have rap music in China do they don't
know absolutely you know have you been there 100% because I watch streaming do
yah and who yah are the twitches of China you can put it right on there do yah
and who yah do you why a okay and h you why a h you why a is on the New York
Stock Exchange and these are aware of these two kids that stream no they're
companies they're companies 10 cent gave each of them 450 million both companies
and said which are you which of you are going to become the biggest streaming
company that's what they do in China they gave they made the competitors the
same company gave both money to both competitors and even this company's
what who yah h you why the company that gave both of them money 10 cent 10 cent
one of the biggest companies in the world okay they own the 40% of Epic really
Jones fortnight yeah what the fuck but what they're doing over there I'll ask
you a question on twitch what do you think the percentage of twitch streamers
the audience doesn't know twitch is on his own by Amazon right and it's where
people play games and in the corner there's a little TV screen with a
streamer which is the guy playing the game and then people like donate money
or subscribe subscribe for four dollars a month and your son T foo is the most
viewed streamer on twitch right correct at the current time being I mean he
could have been bigger if he'd have played apex legends in January he chose
not to maybe everybody went to that and shroud who never competes shroud is a
streamer which brings me back to my point Danny what percentage do you think on
twitch are gamers that stream 99% 90 high 90s right I don't know anybody who's
China I know Bubba the love sponges on twitch that's that's only that's his
only audit what what percentage you think in China again what percentage of what
of the billion people of all the people right they're not a billion streaming I
have no idea on what percentage is the US stream like 99% are gamers oh okay what
percentage okay I see we're saying Chinese streamers are gaming yeah 100 10%
what what does everyone else do 90% this will blow your mind this is why we're
gonna I see where this is going we're building a streaming center for this 90% of
China uh streaming on who you and do you are women and they're not gaming they're
just talking entertaining they're entertainers and what I saw is a huge opening
because no everyone in the US wants to do gaming and but here's the the point
they've got so they want just like low lonely dudes to have conversations with chicks I you
know you can put it in that oh yeah I don't really care anybody we're going to build a
streaming center with women streamers and then we're going to put Turner gaming in China on who
you you're gonna send no I'm not sending you're gonna sit right here we're gonna have him get
there's another Chinese gamer that's on like optic an optic got a deal with who you last week and I
would go Turner and him can play and this guy speaks Mandarin so he can talk to Turner interpret
so Turner will be the first and this guy streamers streaming from the US into China
hmm see yeah the bigger picture the bigger picture is they've got hundreds of millions
maybe I think they're at 800 million people watching who you and do you what do you got with
with twitch probably 15 20 million so the audience is dwarfs and it and when you scale it out I'd
rather have 200 million oh yeah for sure and Turner will be one of the first guys to stream over
there then we're going to bring Chinese women here and teach them streaming here and then they'll
stream back into China from here wow that seems like quite the plan it's a great plan it sounds
like a great plan how you make a that's how you make hundreds of millions is what people think
is that China is backwards they're behind us but the truth is they're ahead of us
for the simple reason is Apple sends the phones over there they know how a phone works before
the public here gets it their engineers are a reverse engineer that's why they're eating
apple's lunch over there we send them the phone technology they're building the next
x-phone for apple yeah well their guys they steal everything and build it in their phones already
so they're further advanced in this country because we're giving them the technology or
they're stealing it and they're building out and because the system is socialist and not capitalist
they can take all of it and train it on one one segment like computers or technology or missiles
but they're way far advanced than people think they think they're a backward country you know
walking around with a rickshaw they're sadly mistaken interesting so you're gonna take
Chinese girls and put them women we're not taking anybody under 18 well when I said girls I mean
right right you know what I mean well I just want to make sure yeah of clarification Chinese women
and you want to and you want to you want to stream them stream them all from one location in that
and you're in this is where's this is this going to happen in the warehouse in the studio the studio
okay and it'll be a separate portion it'll be a separate company run by a woman all the women
will work with women there will be no men I don't want to get into all that crap right I'm not gonna
I don't want to oh he said this that's not gonna happen it's gonna be a straight up right straight
as a string run it like a business woman runs it nobody'll say we're taking advantage yeah we
we're we're funding it okay but we're gonna empower and make millionaires of women okay I bet you
will have a in five years we'll have a hundred women over worth over ten million dollars and
so everybody in the gaming will be fighting over but wait peanuts wait who who is gonna
watch that like so who are these women what are they gonna do on this live stream well a lot of
them like poke main she does play video games she put well they can play video games it doesn't
matter they can they can talk a lot of them poke main who's the bit why amusers she's got over
three million on twitch and she knows how to do it you know there's a lot of others but most of
it is chat that they do right you ever seen that just chat it's called and they'll just talk it's
what you're you know it's communication why wouldn't they just do that like I'm just gonna be the
devil's advocate why wouldn't these girls just do it on their own why would they need to go to your
studio to do it well they're not going to all right how are they going to learn how to be
on instagram how to integrate the content into facebook how to make youtube videos how to do
be on podcasts that we have and we have the big enchilada turners got an audience every night
of 30 50 a hundred thousand so when he stops one of them goes on right and takes his audience
and then we piggyback like three or four people so kids get new people they'd never seen so we're
going to create huge audiences right and then when the girls get bigger we're going to take the other
girls and piggyback but we're going to teach them business how to make money how to monetize
and not take 80 percent and ridiculous contracts a lot of them will actually employ them give them
insurance we'll do it like a business not like a clown show i don't know if turner's gonna agree to
this you might be on your own dick that's all right no i don't know all right you know that i don't
know if it isn't a big building he'd be into hey it's a big building yeah it's a big building
and i've talked to him about it you know it's uh we have companies he doesn't want to do anything
but play but yeah he doesn't want to do anything but stream that's fine we're you know it's a big
building yeah we have a big building i'm gonna hit the our part i'm gonna rent it from him he's
gonna make money he may never even know what's going on right see what does he do what so what
do you guys what's the status on that building what are you doing with it what's like the current
state are you guys renovating it right now are you just you know painted and cleaned it up
i saw you all the spongebob things that jack built outside well we're just it's it's a slow
process yeah we've got to get it up to code and all that stuff and uh there's a couple of companies
want to put money in the studio which is separate from turner see if they put it in the studio it
goes in a corporation and that and that operates he he'll have a piece of it i'm sure but you'll cut
him into your you'll cut him into the business i don't even want it i'll give it to him yeah if i
run it for two years i'll say here we'll go back to enjoying my life right i mean i have it looks
like you are enjoying your life pretty yeah pretty well right but see i'm trying to change streaming
in america that's a big task but it's so simple because it's if 90 percent of streaming in china
is women streaming it obviously works right it works nobody does it here yeah because it all
it was it's all around gaming and making that 450 a month but somebody can get 450 a month
from you know because she's attractive and they may not be attractive i don't care yeah i have
i don't care what race i don't care what background i don't care about any of that i want to see i want
empower people to make money yeah that's what i'm good at you know on social media and i know all of
them i know all the platforms i know you learned because a turner and jack right they i don't know
if i learned i didn't have anything choice you didn't have any choice because they were yeah
because i you know and i'll watch i know all the people on youtube i know the people on instagram
i know snapchat yeah yeah i do snapchat you're on snapchat oh yeah what the hell are you doing
on snapchat well people don't want to watch oh my god snaps what do you want i don't want to know
what the fuck you're doing on snapchat dude nothing i i'm g rated as they get yeah i'm g rated what is
up you so you find ran i saw on your instagram you have like random people you run into and then
you like shout them out and say they're gonna because i thought here's the point instagram models
right yeah because i i it's a gag you're just gonna i do yeah but i thought i could do it once or
twice a week and it would be interesting if someone found it to be because i don't do anything else
with them i do it once right and i go i'll walk up and i'll say you're the next instagram model
they start laughing and i'll just click the camera on and film them yeah and then post it
because it's it's genuine see very little do i do with the boys when the camera's on where you're not
not in character but you know the camera's on yeah so i like to catch people the camera and catch them
in their unassuming mode and maybe one or two of them does well i i'd love that you know
yeah because everyone has that i want to be famous and it's like some kid came up to the
on the beach and said you're famous and i go it's not worth a warm bucket of spit
because i don't get a discount at the restaurant nobody pay i make nothing from it i make zero
okay oh you got 107,000 on instagram well yeah but you have 107,000 followers on instagram i think
it's 106 they didn't like my party why what happened at the party i don't know like i
you lost followers i lost oh desperate okay you know all out turner has to do is spit my way and
they come so i don't know what does that mean wait i don't understand what didn't they like about
i don't know i don't care it means nothing it's like it's like losing my hair i don't have hair who
cares yeah it's it's silly you know my it doesn't matter i'm not making a living from it if if i was
making a living that i'd be concerned well your son's making a living from it well yeah i'm glad
they are you know i get a lot of grief because i used to be jug squad dad you know that on instagram
and you change it to tfoo's dad why that's not fair to jack why he never he put me in his video
and i said you don't even tag me you know what is if i was jack and you changed your name from
t from jug squad dad to tfoo's dad i'd be pissed why he doesn't that's not fair he doesn't call me out
i had no you just fall you just changed it because he's got more followers that's not fair dad
that wasn't dad you're your favorite you're favoriting the other kid
no jack had that for years jack has never i said to him you made this video on fourth of july
and you tag everyone but me you know what he says to me well you have more followers than any of them
put together and i said that's because i'm more interesting they like me and your guys have no
appeal that's my fault i didn't do that so that's why you changed it no i changed it here's why i
changed it his turner got banned and had people to know where he was he wasn't on youtube right he
wasn't on and so i why did he get banned again i don't remember that you got like twitch has super
yeah it's anyways but you're sorry so no one knew he was alive or dead so i put tfoo's dad
and media was was quoting me and so i just left it on i tried three times to give it to the i
two of my kids i said take my i don't even want it take the hundred and whatever take all these
idiots and get them off my and they wouldn't take them so i'm stuck with it you're stuck with tfoo's dad
no i'm not i'll change it it's just not what are you gonna change it to i don't know make something up
i was my concho yeah i was dick savage and i was jug squad dad i don't stay with the thing
you're just an ever-evolving personality they change when we do different things yeah on the
you know then people like if i go out people yell hey mike hi or dick or richard they don't you
know i get called a lot of things well let's go you're driving around in and tfoo's car right
no you won't let me drive you won't let you drive it now pierce and i drove up late one night jack
was out there in the ocean who went up to you know bring him some towels and pierce put the seat
all the way out and left the towels in there so he thought i had a party in his car you know that's
the new thing now they put it on autopilot right fool around right and of course i told him i said
me fooling around it would never happen in a thousand years so you don't have to worry about that
i'm like a monk yeah you are yeah
monkeying around so going let let's go back i want to i find it interesting what you were
saying about the kfc guy who invested all that money and and in the duplexes the eight duplexes
is that sort of the same thing that turner did you did he know or did you know when he was
spending all this time in his room playing video games for hours on end every day were you concerned
at all that he like like this kid needs to figure out what he's going to do with his life and figure
out a career no or did you guys know that yeah he's gonna have no eventually turn this into a career
no we he just was working 10 12 hours from six to six six at night playing six in the morning
fool it's work if you put me in front of a computer terminal i don't care what if i'm playing uh online
poker right for 12 hours buddy that's work right i understand it's i understand now it's it's definitely
time but back then it may you may not have thought it was what i'm trying to say is
in the beginning you may not have perceived it that way you may have thought oh this kid's just
obsessed with video games that's what that's what anyone wouldn't know i don't even think about that
if you thought he's definitely there's no different than if turner and jack could have been
easily pro surfers easily they'd be the top two pros in the world or in the top five
guaranteed but that's not the path they took and jack you know and the other thing that that that
torques me lately is some group said they made turner's career well that's the biggest crock
i've ever heard in my life turner made turner's career he's been on youtube for 12 years which
predates the guys that think they know youtube and all this who are trying to claim they helped
him jack helped him they were on youtube he was famous all over the world for at least six or
seven years and the gaming was just a different he he gravitated to it he wanted to game so he
came i didn't need his money did you know he was making money in the beginning though well he showed
me though he came to me at a contract when he was like 18 okay they paid peanuts you know i'd read it
over and i'd say sure a sign it doesn't matter i find it interesting uh how there's a couple videos
on youtube talking about how they they offered and i'm probably completely saying this the wrong way
but they said that they offered a transfer or something they were going to transfer him
transfer his con like he's a like he's a nfl player or an nba player like what the
can you do that is that even a real thing that's just oh we're going to transfer you to this other
company that's grasping it's what is that i mean that's like saying is there like that i mean well
the nba and nfl there's players unions right right so right there it's all regulated this is not
regulated these are just private businesses yeah and this is not athletics there's you know that ncaa
about a month to go right said it absolutely is not sports 100 we are not all the colleges
started doing esports the word e is electronic yes the word sports is sports and ncaa said we will
not make it a sport no matter what you say no matter what you say so it's already pretty much
people know it's ridiculous sitting in a chair pressing your fingers is not a sport playing with
a little and to try and portray that is is it's ludicrous if it's not a sport what is it it's
entertainment it's okay is card playing world poker tour is that a sport
that's a good question it's not it's entertainment we're playing but i can see how it could be defined
loosely as a sport i think i mean you could what else would you call it it's a game it's a game
sports or games you're a gamers but they're trying to say baseball and football and playing a game
on a computer is not it's the word esports makes sense but to make it broader and say it's a sport
is it's here's why they're trying to do that the big old companies nba nfl major league baseball
hockey those owners want to own sports teams so they are now buying esports teams and folding
them in and saying we're in this and it's esports because they're losing all the audiences i talked
to you know young people all the time they come over looking for turner and jack and i said you
play sports no what do you do i game i'm on the computer so what does that tell you down the line
baseball football basketball are going to be history because when all these kids grow up
they're not going to watch it they don't play it see that's the big problem they don't participate
in the school so they're not going to play the if you don't play baseball you're not going to watch
baseball you don't play football you're not going to watch it right and it's going away and all the
owners know it so they're trying to buy esports teams so they can make the model the same as
football and put their money in that and that's why there's all this money rushing into the thing
see okay so that's how those you got that's how one of the big ways that these esports
companies like phase are raising money from guys like that well as well as advertisers and but but
see what turner did and he was not the guy that i mean it just evolved up to this point the gamers
were dr disrespecto dr lupo uh tim the tat man these guys have been doing it for seven eight
nine years on twitch and they had like a million and a half two million that's all they had then
fortnight came in and ninja was brilliant he said yeah um here's what he came up with when
when when you get an amazon prime you get you get one free twitch um subscription so if i want to
watch ninja i go to mommy and daddy and he was telling kids go to mom and dad and say can i have
the free subscription then they can chat with him directly they're allowed to write on there right
so he figured this out and got this huge following and he was making a million a month last year
a year you know a year ago who was ninja ninja because he figured it out quicker than anyone else
and the real gamers were not real happy with this guy because he's blue hair he's mainstream and he
had brilliant marketing they blew him up yeah and turner as you know because you came in early on
you were in and want to do that and i knew that he was going to blow up because i got a video
that i watch youtube all the time and i saw it was like 70 or 80 000 turner is the best fortnite
player in the world so i watched the video and i understood enough to know this guy was i mean
subjective to say you're the best out of 250 million is a little i don't turner will be the first to
say there's probably many people better right that's absurd but when that guy said it that's when he
blew up that's when he just and then people started watching that was before he signed who was it that
said that i don't know the video's on there okay like six million or eight million it blew up
wow and blew him up and that's when the guys thought oh we'll just sign him to a contract
to make a lot of money off him yeah i mean the kid was living in my house since he was born yep
he went out to hollywood maybe last year 80 90 days 80 90 days and the guys that were there
drunk all the time go well we made this guy who he is i'm like and they came to my house and i said
he didn't do anything for him you think you did and people can listen to your lies but the truth is
the kid did it on his own from his incredible skills he won tournaments it's like saying
michael jordan started with the chicago bulls the team sucked okay he sucked for years did the bulls
come out when he won the first we made him right if he hadn't been here do you think if michael
jordan had gone to the lakers or the nicks they would have been the winners right turner could
have gone to joe's bar and grill and played in pick hip see new york and he's still been the best
see so to take somebody's credit have you heard me say i made turner if it wasn't for me i am you
know that's crap yeah that's kind of a cheap yeah no that's that that's such a bull you do not take
credit for anyone now if you're married to them then i think it's a different story i think the
partner has the right to say i help them be successful see but anything where you say i made
them the only guys that make anyone were the old mafia when they made a a lieutenant that made man
yeah that wasn't a good thing because you didn't have a long career after that yeah
how much money is this kid making right now i don't know
can you guess yeah i don't care no clue i don't care he doesn't care don't have anything to do with
life has to do with money has nothing to do with life not in in this instant when he was making
200 a week doing 80 hours i say to him kiddingly and jack always brings it up i'd say you know you
could have made seven dollars an hour washing dishes and you'd be making three times the amount
of money and i would say it kiddingly to him i wouldn't tell him you need to quit that gaming crap and
go get a job i never said that never never i told jack when he went when he was 18 i said i got a
free paid college glam do you gonna go to school he goes no i said well then you're gonna have to go
down and get a job at public and he said is there another way and i said yeah the fame game the fame
game yeah the fame game you can make it on youtube but you can't make it making skim boarding videos
you have to become an entertainer you have to and that's when he went out he got a couple of
youtubers and he blew up with that um the slender man on the beach yeah that was his first break
and the drinking prank too right well that was a little that was with turner yeah that's the big
that's why when people say we made this guy a big star turner's got 18 million on youtube
from eight years ago so don't tell me you did something he knew he could stop gaming today
we were laughing about this he said to me i can make a vlog every day and never game and have
he could have more than mr beast yeah if he wanted to do that he can do anything he wants
he'd be the best hamburger flipper if he was flipping hamburgers and he'd just be the same
person he'd be just as happy same with jack jack goes out and digs in the dirt and finds
megalodon and shark's teeth for fun he's not doing it for money he's cataloging and showing
because what they try and do is they do things and share it with their audience to motivate
and get kids to go wow i'm just sitting here playing games i can jump off a bridge i can do
whatever i mean we don't tell you to jump off a bridge you'll probably break your neck
um it's probably a bad idea yeah 30 feet's probably the max i did is it true that he made
people are claiming out there that he made over like 15 million bucks last year that's absurd if
he's making not even close he didn't make it's not i don't even think he made a mill what come on
not after taxes uh-oh he did i can't get into it but it's i mean they made well let's put a
perspective 70 million dollars let's put it into perspective for the people that are listening
yeah how successful how much money someone like turner can make now this year's different but
i'm not going to talk about that he's doing much better this can we put it in a ballpark
no i'm not gonna i don't speculate on people's income whether it's yours mine or a guy i meet
i don't i don't know what it is so i'm not going to talk about why would i don't know i know he's
done i know he's done better but he's in the litigation so he can't sign contracts you know
we had to pass on on a lot of big contracts because of because the control that but i'm not
worried because of what's going on with that let's put it this way he's in he's in he's fine
but he's not just so you know and he's the craziest thing is he's still living in your house
that's that's i mean well that was our deal what what he said to me six seven months ago
and and and i don't tell him what to do right we talk i have an opinion he does exactly because
i trust him from the time he was probably 16 he makes good decision but he said to me i want to
go buy that contract he didn't well he didn't i never saw it when he came back with that it says
the worst but that you know you have to live and learn of course people say well he shouldn't assign
it okay i don't i'll take any 20 year old kid okay i'll put him in my Lamborghini if i have one
i'm a young guy i'll take him out i'll show him a good time i'll throw him some girls and i'll get
him drunk when he doesn't drink and then tell him sign right here you don't i'll tear it up it doesn't
mean a thing and the kid will sign it so for people to say i wouldn't have signed it everybody's
signed right they're they're naive right okay i agree yeah i i've been in many situations where
people as an adult try and get me to sign contracts and i go not doing it i've gotten up and walked out
of when i'm sitting there with 30 people you gotta sign this we're gonna i go i'm out what are you
and they're arguing and i just leave it's hard when you're pressured and you're doing a business
deal because people that aren't in business don't know they don't know and when you're told ah it
doesn't mean it will throw it away you think you trust them right especially when they're and then
and then all of a sudden it's all attorneys going i mean anyone that doesn't believe me on contracts
just watch the social network when they brought the guy in they were buddies they were best buddies
zuckerberg who started facebook if you don't know go watch the social network he brought in his best
friend they said hey we got some papers for you to sign and he looked at everything he said you
read this and they said yeah he signed it and he diluted his own stock and wrote himself out of the
company because zuckerberg stuck him in the back with a knife so if you want to get to who stuck
who in with a knife it's the guy that tells you sign the contract i won't screw you that's the guy
sticking the knife it's already in your back not after the fact when you go why am i not making
any money watch this listen to these words a person i know never got any money at all from their
contract a person you know a person i know never got a dime no 10 99 so who is this person i just
a nice person i know okay are you supposed to assume something here no i'm just saying okay
see when you work for someone you've worked for people and i have you get a 10 99 right no yeah
yeah when you're when you're a contractor when you're an independent contractor and when you don't
get a 10 99 that means you didn't make any money right right imagine that
maybe this haven't sent the 10 99 yet well they got to send something with it called money right
you don't get any money you don't need a 10 99 yeah i guess you're right see the truth is always
different than a bs in life everyone wants to be asked i don't want to be asked i just to tell the
truth yeah yep well you're doing well you raised a couple really successful kids who are doing what
they love making a shitload of money all four of them are i mean pierce is just starting to stream
is it pierce is your youngest son yeah how old is he 19 19 okay and i told him i said what do you
want to do and he and he was gaming and i said you're on fortnight you gotta you know you gotta
get in the family business the family business well i may stream i'll play um poker you're streaming
right now i met i'm in it well i'm gonna do podcast you should you're really good at talking i want
to bring you in this and we'll do a i'll come in we'll do no we'll do duels duels yeah okay i'm gonna
do dual podcasts you're gonna do it on your channel i'm gonna do it on mine okay but we're
gonna be there that way everyone don't see because here's what happens with money everybody gets greedy
i wanted you know and i i believe that empower like jack's running his own business he has his own
llc turner has his like five of them and and i have my own company it's just the way it's easier
you don't have any fights over money or arguing i i want my audience and what i love is people say
you're doing it for the clout i'm like what i don't care about clout what am i gonna do with it
what does it get me you know a long time ago when the kids were doing clout what does clout get you
that's a good question i don't know people well no people are very interesting we define clout
real clout would be subscribers um that you get people's attention based on my son like
based on how you're so like if i say tfuz dad i'm using him and you know that my only interest
is to promote him if you look on my instagram it's all about him or jack or my daughter right
because i don't what what am i going to do with the clout wow i got a bunch of subscribers that
no one cares about and people basically judge how important you are based on how many followers
you have well yeah but that's seven year olds seven year olds and and everybody at the phase
clan because they call it the clout house well yeah but they lost the seed did you know that
it's called the the lout house now yes it's now the well it's just the l i mean turner left
that was it yeah um and now the guy's girlfriend left the main guy i mean i'd look in the mirror
and go i must be really screwing up here when my main guy and my girlfriend split right that's
and i'm hiring 12 year olds having them do videos that's pretty embarrassing in my opinion but i don't
care you know i wish them well i hope they do very well maybe he's just doing it for clout
maybe it's just a big uh a scheme just to get more clout i guess i don't know what we're gonna do with
it like a long time ago somebody asked me isn't when jack was big with jug squad and we had hundreds
i mean he's bigger now than he was then but there were hundreds of kids coming and somebody goes
wow this is that great don't you love being you know involved in all this and i go if it doesn't
get me laid and it doesn't get me paid i don't care but you do love it you can tell that you love it
i love what they do yeah no i can tell that you love i can tell it's very obvious that you that you
enjoy it's like you've almost like found a whole new life by there by everything that they've created
it's like you no it seems like that from my perspective well because it's just the family unit
right no yeah it's just as exciting right as when jack was four years old we went to myrtle beach
and he was surfing on a uh boogie board in seven foot waves and people were standing a crowd watching
it you see it's the dynamic of my family right i love watching them successful and it's rare to
see and it's just parent be involved in so much of what they do even at this stage in their life
like no matter what they're doing i mean obviously 99 percent of it takes place at your home so you
can't help but not be there but it seems like you're always there involved and you're always
a big part of what they're trying to help whatever i can do yeah but well you're a great dad you look
at yourself you look at you look at you know the kardashian woman i mean she runs oh no but
i admire her business acumen yeah i mean she's got the one girl a billionaire and that girl's got
15 employees which one kiley or kendall the one doing the the makeup kyle yeah and then well
they're all million they're all multi fucking million yeah but she's a billionaire she youngest
billionaire in the world kyle generate woman yeah and it's mom business acumen i mean that's
you know they listen and then you look at and you look at um taylor swift her dad has been running
her career from day one yeah he isn't and i and i'm just talking about the business and
the business i'm not interested in agent i don't want to go out you know book them and i don't
care about that all i look at is the contracts that with the attorney they send it to the attorney
i'll read it i might make a notation and if turner wants to do a deal he does it if he doesn't want
to do a deal he doesn't do it right i don't rail i'm not in on it i'm not getting a percentage
so i'm not like an agent you have to do this or i'm not going to be your agent that's what they do
that's what the the problem taylor swift had was scooter brawn his scooter brawn i talked to
two guy went through taylor's dad and he said you can't get these agents because they would
scream at her you have to go here you have to do this i'm your agent and she was like 16 15
and he was you know and he and he did it all through her career and that's why she got rid of
him is they the agents become the enemy because they're just chasing a commission right yeah they're
chasing a commission they don't care what you do you're like a show pony take them to every
circus in town work them to death and my thing is turner he works 12 hours a day when are you
going to get him to work more he doesn't need to work more he already works jack jack out works
almost every human i've ever met in hours put in he does doing what he does uh the youtube and
you know preparing and shooting and editing videos yeah i mean he's always working always going back
to to taylor swift and agents and stuff there's a weird the one of the weirdest creepiest fucking
things is the hollywood parents that want their children to be stars like actors and these these
parents will i forget there's like a name for them i can't remember what it is right now
but their goal in life is to get their kids to be famous somehow so they mail in their headshot to
random addresses they'll find casting agencies or talent agencies or whatever and they take their
kids and they just ship their their headshots to these random places to these agencies with the
address attached like there's parents that are just trying to feed off getting their kids except
stage parents yeah well here's here's a weird fucking thing well when i lived there i lived in
hollywood mine my i had a duplex and my neighbor was working for the biggest talent agency in
hollywood when i had a baby i said to him you know i was thinking i'm gonna send my wife and they'll
do like commercials like baby and he goes and this is a guy in the business he had the top talent
top guys you know like um tom cruise i mean he had the top guys and he said over my dead body
and i said why and he said there are all a bunch of perverts and weirdos and scum i'm not gonna
let your daughter around them i said it's a baby he said doesn't matter no and i learned from him
he stood in front of me and i respected the guy he was the top agent in hollywood for talent and he
said it's not a business for children so when my daughter wanted to do youtube at 15 i said no way
because i learned from him and that's why when i see people signing kids up 12 14 years old and
dragging them to hollywood i'm like there's nothing good gonna happen especially if your
name is high in your name you're gonna be high all the time so it's really a bad thing to bring
children in that environment because and another thing i was in a nightclub with a very very one
of the top actors in hollywood and i look over and there's a girl she's 12 and she's drinking
and i go what's going on he goes it's drew barry moore she's a movie star her parents
were the biggest stars in hollywood going back 40 years holy shit and they allowed her to drink
because in hollywood if you're a kid and you're making money if you're in hollywood and you're
a kid and you're making a lot of money yeah you can do whatever the heck you want to this day
you want drugs they'll get you drugs as long as you make that system money they'll protect you
so i learned those lessons a long time ago and they stayed out of it they you know we did youtube
here but i was pretty much around the whole time and jack did it and how old was jack when
he started doing youtube it was probably 14 but it was all i can't believe you didn't let your
daughter do it she could have been just as big as tfue right now she'll probably make more money
in them and the company she's with why did she need to what's the rush here's the point there's
no rush there's no rush when you and you're having a child soon i am you should be a kid as long as
you can so you should have fun no worries about money go out and play learn figure out what you
want to do and do it later because if we go back to drew barrymore and i can go a hundred different
examples in the last five years kid stars don't have a childhood so they lost their childhood
they then get into drugs and alcohol they don't know how to handle it and they screw their entire
lives up right that's why you don't want them to rush into it right why kid stars turn out fucked
up for the right so i don't see any advantage of being a big star as a child on youtube you're
gonna have a screwed up life yeah okay people are sticking kids in with older men so that they can
become famous in gaming i i do not know a parent i don't know a one parent that would let a 12 or
14 year old boy hang around 28 30 year old men that are drinking it never would happen
but the lure of the kid will be successful and i'll tell you this i'll make this clear if you
tell me he's living his dream that's what a parent does is keeps a kid from becoming an adult
because why don't we just put kids at walmart at eight he wants to work at all walmart he's eight
that's his dream why don't you let him do it well because the government says you got to be 13
and even when you're 13 you can only work 20 hours and you have to go to school that's why
they make the rules but see hollywood perverts the rules right they say okay you can be on a tv
show and you're famous it doesn't mean anything what about going to school with your friends or
being schooled at home and being a kid let kids be kids that's my mantra
let them be kids then there's time jack and turner done very well
so the proof is in the putting proof is in the motherfucking putting right
when your baby's born you're gonna say my baby's born i'm not gonna i'm not gonna put her on the
podcast and try and make her famous it's a it's a boy so oh it is a boy congratulations oh that's a
big that's a big thing in a podcast he's got a boy he's got his name will live on his name will be
lebron lebron jones is that no maybe i shouldn't give him a regular name be run yeah they'll just
screw him up then i was just gonna name him lebron and send him to hollywood good no don't
do that okay you're not gonna do all right i'll name him look at me nothing that hollywood is just a
it's like my friend who's lived out there his whole life i was just gonna let him filled with crooks
liars and thieves well when he turns one i was just gonna send him to the phase clan there you go
and send it we'll i'll write up a crayon thing that says i'm ten
i am yes yes yes i love it hey do we have anyone that wants to call and talk to dick
any phone numbers not one not one nobody one bullshit we covered all the subjects they don't
need us there's nobody they're all asleep i put them to sleep the problem is everybody
they're just they're all obsessed with ben let's they only want to hear from ben and hear him talk
about real estate because they're fascinated by his his net worth and his outgoing personality
yeah well i think he's the smartest person on earth that may be true but he has no friends
he says that himself that he has no friends oh he doesn't care no he doesn't care he doesn't care
and and you know that's fine it works for him before you met him on the when you came on the
first podcast at his house right you had been watching like a couple life for sale episodes
and then when you met him on the podcast and we did like a whatever it was a 45 minute to an hour
long podcast there were you had an epiphany about ben and what was it you said to me that he didn't
translate or something like that no what what when i first saw your videos yeah i thought ben was
gandalfi from uh sopranos sopranos because i thought his guy's a great actor then when i met
him i thought he's just a putz and you're the great uh videographer you're the great director
and producer you were using a guy to showcase your incredible storytelling and you made ben
bigger than life and that's hard to do because he can't even look down and see his penis for the
last 15 years that's true so i mean you're the the reason that he is who he is on the on the
on the internet on the internet but not if it had been someone else he wouldn't have been anything
because you wouldn't they wouldn't have gotten an audience yeah you took a it's an interesting
insight coming from you a pig's ear and made a silk purse a pig that liked a pig's ear to a silk
purse yeah well it's it's it's he's not that complex he's a really simple yeah and and his
his real estate acumen is is so basic that you could buy you could buy a book he's just because
he's bombastic overbearing and looks larger in life because you've made him look larger in life
people find him appealing because the whole interest of society now is to be famous and rich
right and neither make any difference to your wife or your children and that's the only thing that
matters in life is your wife and children what they think of you matters and sometimes that
doesn't matter i mean because you can't always make people happy they can say well i don't like
my dad well that's tough you only get one mine died mine died when i was 12 when you don't have
and i think that you know Ben's root cause is he didn't have a father so he acts out that's his whole
thing is he's that way well he's exactly like his mother who's a psychopath really yeah he literally
is like the male version of his mother so he's just he's working on being a psychopath he's just
a sociopath working his way up right exactly i mean that's how the latter is climbing the ladder
he's climbing the ladder yeah no but that's but that's the biggest revelation i had with ben was
that when i met his mom i realized he is so much fucking like his mom but she had no father to
backhand him say don't do this well he had a father but he he in his own words he says his
father had no backbone his father was you know was cheap didn't he was like a
i don't know what you would call it he was spineless or or he didn't have balls he didn't
he said that's what he said no that how long did he know him when he was five yeah i don't know
i guess they split up at one point but he said my dad had no balls where is trying to pinch every
penny he died yeah a couple years ago when he's like 93 or something like that he did pretty good
hope to get shot in the back at 98 by a jealous husband
what want to get that's how i want to go that's how you want to go
shot in the back by a jealous husband that's a good way to go
you got to go with some time yeah you got to help people you got to do things
you know jack goes and works with with um kids on the beach for free on like tonight and
thursdays hundreds of kids come up and he spends time with them and he doesn't need to do that
turner he's given out hundreds of thousands of charity
my daughter worked with kids for years in in teaching them drama and that type of thing
and pierce is nice to everyone everyone loves pierce and that's what matters is what you give back
not what you take how much your house is and the only reason ben bought that big house is when
i went to his house i he goes where do you live and i go i live on the front row i'm on the beach
and you're in the back row here in the back water and i think that burned his butt and he said i gotta
get to the front row but he didn't walk down the beach i've never seen him walk down i bet he'll
never walk down the beach you don't leave the patio yeah you don't touch the sand
tell him i'll come over and blow up his house he's not that far from you he literally lived
walk past his house a billion times i mean all he did is you know he he took it from a
a broke baseball player yeah nobody else would step up to the plate and he'll flip it you won't
even care people like the baseball player that he took the house that he bought bought the house
from ryan howard who make shit load he was like one of the highest paid if i'm not mistaken
one of the he got one of the highest contracts in major league baseball one of the highest paying
contract but if you don't have it invested and you're just spending it but now now i think he's
an analyst for espn yeah he makes a couple and he had to get rid of the house so it's saying that
you know maybe he didn't he didn't invest it wisely so it's a good invested in the house
right i mean it to his credit he was building it when the crash came and he literally
held up hundreds of of guys livelihoods all the trucks would be there all the time working
when there was no work in construction so i mean he actually helped the economy out for a lot of
guys yeah you know in a very tough time and he built a beautiful house it is but he you know i mean
beautiful mic mansion i mean turner's gonna have investments and he is investing and he has very
smart money managers and he's not going to go down that route because like turner's money came so
you know this year came so quick it was like a lottery you know it's a lottery you you don't
have it wasn't like what's his tax bracket was he gonna pay back 40%
soon i don't talk to the account i don't i honestly i put him with i bring in the right people
the money managers top money managers yeah at at meryl lynch bank of america we're not dealing
with joe blow out of hollywood who says i'm good with money or bernie made off we're dealing with
you know straight line and people that have lots of money recommended him you know what i mean it's
these and he's not in any risk you know he owns like they bought him i saw this come by they bought
farm shares farm shares yeah it's a i don't i'm using farm what's gonna happen next year
when the election is all the farm states will get a huge amount of money
from the government and then why well because he needs those states
okay so these guys and i called the guys said why'd you buy that i said is this the reason and he
goes it's real quiet well that could be the reason i said i guess they hit that on the head wow see
and when you're up way up you look at things a different way yeah and you know that money's
gonna flow a different way it's kind of like uh the wizard of of oma hall whatever that guy
berkshire hathaway the richest man in the world yep what people don't understand all these environmentalists
were out there screaming we don't want the keystone pipeline well this is terrible and they made obama
say oh we're not gonna bring oil down from canada to the refineries we don't want the
keystone pipeline right well guess why why obama's best friend was berkshire hathaway this guy who
owns the railroads and he was shipping all the oil the most dangerous way into possible
100 freight cars full of crude down to the refineries and he didn't want the pipeline
because that cut out his railroads but they made it out like they're environmentally sensitive
so you just all you need is the information it's all there you connect the dots right but they made
out was environmental i we got a couple phone numbers you want to do like two calls are they
single we'll find out okay not men i'm sorry it's nothing personal but do it on the uh they're
gonna call people you know i was in the payphone make sure it's connected to bluetooth people don't
even know what a payphone is i was in yeah nowadays nobody knows where i was here's where i put in
payphones by white cell yeah south son to la in compton england compton the worst areas in the uh
middle 80s late 80s killing people everything i was dealing with gang bangers all the time
i can still to this day read graffiti i know what it physically walking you were physically
installing them on the street yeah i just put them in and they'd come up and they'd go
you know and what i learned as i was a minority there oh yeah for sure you know and but you know
i went to integrated schools from time i was in eighth grade so i get along with everybody
and they come up and they'd start in on me they tried to see and i go i'm putting a phone in
it's got the phone number on it it rings in because nobody allowed the phones to ring in
because they didn't want it and i'd say here's your office guys everyone loved my phones
and also charged 20 cents everyone charged a quarter and they said why i said the perception
of value they're putting a quarter in but it says 20 cents you know what i mean and a nickel
today doesn't mean anything but in those days it meant a little bit yeah you want to call ben
why of course they want ben who cares yeah i call him i'll put a blimp suit on and and so
daddy what are you with the book i'm here for nothing you're a fucking idiot you got me on
here all the time what else i don't know why i'm on here i got this dumb ass always asking me
dumb ass questions i don't know why i'm doing it why do i do this for you i don't see why i do it for
you snap on tools who is this adam willack from new jersey adam willack from new jersey i like
snap on tools are good are you are you calling to talk to uh tfoo's dad
well you know kind of but i kind of miss the ben and jimmy and and your shows are amazing
deckhands is amazing ben it's just hilarious but i'm into video games a little bit okay
that's who he is right uh his father uh yeah his father now tfoo is the video game guy yes
this is his father so do you want to play video games you want to you want to put you want to
make money playing video games no no i just watch people that do it i'm just so amazed
like how people can actually do that and um you know make money doing that it's just amazing
it is amazing isn't it especially that twitch do you have any information about that twist
like how it works and how you do make money doing that yeah you you go on twitch and you you um
create an account so you can game and then when you get like i don't know five hundred
then you can monetize it that this how it works you have a amazon prime
i do i do okay you have within amazon prime you can go on a twitch channel like my sons
and you can you can watch him but if you want to talk to him you have to be subscribed well amazon
prime gives you one free subscription so you could go on my son's channel while you're watching him
and then you could subscribe he makes four dollars and fifty cents from amazon and you're able to
and how long does this subscription last per month like you have to re-up it every month yeah
but you can buy multiple right but it's but it's free for all the and so what the kids do is they
get their parents to say oh i don't care it's free it's within right within the 110 or whatever
120 dollars and ninja became the expert because he saw this and because they opened it up they said
they'd give free to you know they could increase twitch viewership so he saw this as a great opening
and got kids to talk their parents and he was making a million a month last year
well yeah i saw my friends kids they're just sitting in front of the computer and i'm wondering
why are you watching someone play video games and just watching them you know when you can be playing
it yourself yeah i mean to us as adults i'd rather watch paint dry yeah like maybe to learn i don't
know why yeah kids are doing it well in my kid's case he's an entertainer so they they go there to
listen and be entertained yeah and talk and they to the because i don't know how it's hard if he's
playing the video game right and how can he communicate back on the screen and read the
comment well he it's all a chat room it's like a chat type thing but but he's so good he'll look
over at the chat and he'll make a remark once in a while but a lot of the kids wow they're talking
to each other too somebody will make a comment and the other kiddles make a comment back to him
so there's a lot of interaction see between the comments and then they can this is the
nuttiest thing because i walked in his room a couple years ago and i saw on the screen
donation $400 and after he's done i said yeah i said wait a minute what did that mean he says
this guy gave me $400 someone just gave him $400 so i said are you meeting him in a park later
and i was serious i know i don't i was concerned and he said no they donate what i said this is
high-tech begging that's the way i look at it honestly and and what does the guy that gave the
$400 get out of that nothing just whatever his name is let's say it's uh because they all have
pseudonyms is joe's bar and grill or sam the the the killer goes on the screen and it stays on the
screen so the approbation is seeing their name on his channel i mean it's kind of it's kind of a thin
thing we live in these days i mean that's the most bizarre i mean the other day he came he jumps out
the window of the house occasionally and we're on the first floor but it's still concrete so
i was standing outside and he came flying out the window i'm like what and he heard himself
and i go would you do that for he says somebody gave me $2,500
i was so lucky he said $2,500 to do that on the channel on the show and i said can they give
me that i'll jump out of the window all day i'll stay i'll do it all night you know i've never
gotten $400 given to me you know it's crazy that's in it did you ever hear of the did you ever hear
the del ring misfit or jason jenova no who is that they do a youth they do like a fitness uh
youtube and this guy jason jenova makes these youtube videos for like 10 years and he's kind
of like slow and has also but he has a big following he uses that twist and people like
make fun of them on there but they donate and they try to get them you know to jerk off to get
naked jerk off like that they embarrass them yeah i've heard about that but he see he's obviously
a great guy because he's figuring you can say whatever the hell you want as long as they get paid
i mean i should on twitch though right he wants that five bucks you know five bucks five bucks
coming in five bucks coming in but he's very he's not good at the game you know he's just doing it
because right he wants to make money because he's the money and people people just be ready if he's
got a handicap like that god love him that i i find that the people offensive but the kids
found a way to make a living from his own handicap that even and i and and he's willing to take it
you know that's cool i hope he's well grounded because and now you were saying you know about amazon
you were talking about amazon i mean yeah i have a snap on tool franchise so i sell
snap on tools but i'll sell anything else you know if a customer wants a different brand
it's gotten so bad that i bought stuff on amazon you know for the customer and just sold you know
have raised the price a little bit just to compete with the other markets out there that's how bad
it's getting that i have to go on amazon buy different brands and sell that you can also
look into reselling on amazon where you don't even touch the equipment there's a bunch of companies
and guys will buy from amazon yeah i saw that and they're reselling it they're no they're not getting
right actual stuff they're using the stock from amazon changing the name and description and
they don't do anything they don't the amazon sends it out ships it and you're making a
five bucks on a arbitrage yeah wow and you're smart enough you've been in the game you could
probably make a living yeah yeah i see you could buy those mystery packages too or you can buy
returned a product on amazon like a whole bunch of or like a hundred bucks you can get a whole
bunch of products or auctions that they do or something like that or maybe that's ebay where
you buy all this stuff that's been returned and then you can resell it or maybe just keep it for
yourself and it could be worth a lot more they just don't want to send it back or throw it out
or something like that yeah it's amazing isn't it but uh cool man thanks for the call hey daniel um
i was just in clear water because they they said that you guys just got rated number one beaches
