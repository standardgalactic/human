Alex Hooper. Hi. Hi. Welcome. How you doing sir? I'm great. How are you guys? I'm great.
Tell our audience who doesn't know who you are, who don't know who you are. Tell
them a little bit about blah. Easy for you to say. It's a little bit about
yourself and where you came from and what you do. Okay so wow that's a lot
in the first 30 seconds. Just give us the whole story. Let's really so. So when my
mom expelled me from her vagina, should we start there? No. I'm a comedian. I live
in Los Angeles. I've been there for 12 years doing stand-up at the same amount
of time. Most people that do know who I am know me from America's Got Talent. I've
been on two seasons of that 2018 and 2020. This year I was last year I was a
quarter finalist and most people know because I roast the judges on there. I
go on there in very flamboyant peacocking outfits and I just with full
machismo bravado just talk shit to billionaires and where everyone else
tries to get the judges to love them. I do the exact opposite of that. I think of
myself as a heel on that show. I come in to shake things up and the same thing I
did on Comedy Central's Roast Battle a few years ago too but now I'm just
torn around as a stand-up. Fuck yeah dude I love the robe that you have. Thank
you very much. It's fucking beautiful and what is the what is like the little
robot? It's actually a gift from Burning Man. In 2018 I went for the first time
I'd been building up to it for years and the theme that year was I Robot. So a
friend of mine that goes every year gave me this necklace and I just love it
and yeah and then yeah the kimonos are just my fiance makes them for me. I have
a lot of nice she makes a lot of like weird festival clothing just for fun so
I try to put as much of that part of my life into myself on stage and you know
festivals are a big part of your life. I love them they're the best like in just
all the anything like when I started going I think I started going like 2011
really to like bigger ones like I first started going to like Coachella and stuff
like that and I just realized like this is the most fun any human can have. I'm
listening to all of my favorite music in a single weekend I'm running around
stuffing drugs in my face and with all of my friends and what could be more fun
than this and the more I started going the more I realized people really were
wearing stuff at festivals that they wouldn't wear in the normal world and I
realized like that's a place where you can really express yourself like any
anyone you want to be like one of the Burning Man has ten principles and one
of them is radical self-expression. What do you want to be right now? And so I
realized that the freest form of myself is when I'm out there because I don't give
a fuck I have unlimited energy and I just want to be silly and just dance
around like a puppet and the more I started incorporating that stuff into
my comedy the more I really started figuring out who I wanted to be on stage
and in the regular world. So did you take a lot of mushrooms and
acid before you went to your first festival? Allegedly. Yeah I mean I started
doing I started smoking pot when I was like 14 I first did mushrooms when I
was 16 and I didn't like I started like I just ate a full eighth when I was 16
at a party where all my friends were getting drunk only this other friend
and I were like well we have these we don't feel like drinking and they just
we just did that and I was that was this sounds so cliche to say but it was the
first time I was like oh like trees are like real they're alive and I really
started looking at like the world differently and I realized then that I
just really like psychedelics and that they would influence me in a lot of ways
as long as I use them properly. Hell yeah. That's scary dude I heard of story
from the kid the kid who he started he's a YouTube channel called all gas no
breaks where he goes around and he actually did an episode at Burning Man
and he's just like this goofy kid named Andrew Calligan and he goes around and
interviews people like these bum fuck places around the world around the
country mainly in the travels in this like Winnebago and he told the story
about when he was like 15 16 he took a lot of acid and a lot of mushrooms and
now he's like perma-tripping. Yikes. And he says he sees shit like constantly every day
like he'll see things floating around in his vision all the time he's like yeah
I just wish I wouldn't done so much drugs when I was young. I think yeah I
mean I think I like I definitely like I didn't go hard when I was young like I
think I really like I did I experimented here and there but when I was like 25
that's when I was like okay I can kind of like level this up a little bit more
like I think I I know how to do it in a responsible way so I don't destroy my
brain but I remember growing up like you would hear the same stories again and
again like if you eat acid one time it's gonna be in your spinal fluid forever
yeah you're gonna sneeze and all of a sudden you're gonna be tripping dude in
the middle of work at a consulting center and I was like oh no and then you
hear the other people like did you hear about the one girl that was in the
scene asylum because she ate too many mushrooms and she thought she was a
glass of orange juice and she started trying to peel herself cuz to get the
juice out and I was like and when you're a kid you're like oh my god I can't
believe that that's so I'm never gonna do those things but I was also just like
that can't really be a thing right right something else was wrong with that
person if there was if anything like that were to occur so that's my whole
thing is like yeah I only do drugs that are fun and I only do them to make
already fun situations more fun right don't do drugs in a bad mood that's not
allowed sorry to interrupt but this episode of the podcast is brought to

the Simpsons when they're watching this meteor shower and he just goes I don't
even need drugs to enjoy this just to enhance it and I'm like bam you just
nailed it that's exactly what that's a fucking great that's a great quote yeah
yeah I've never taken any kind of LSD or mushrooms but I want to I've always been
for I've had so many people on here recently who have just been taught like
I had like last week I had a guy or two weeks ago I had these guys people on
here that they're filmmakers and they once they started taking mushrooms now
everything they make is about tripping like every single project they do they're
working on a project now called uh I figured it's called supposed to be like
the American trip or something like that where he's gonna get like a couple
families together in the woods where they take mushrooms and and like an
intervention type thing okay because his whole life is revolved around taking
mushrooms now then you know something that's what I'm afraid of it no see I
mean that happens to people but I think part of him probably wanted that to
happen in some way like he maybe he needed a thing to be able to really like
create his art and stuff like that and realize that's an avenue because like I
also I you I use that I've used them medicinally to like once a year I will do
a psychedelic at least once a year completely by myself where I just
shut myself in like a room and like you know put on great music and some cool
lighting and I just let it do whatever it wants to me and I like I will cry for
hours on end I'll just cuddle my dogs like it's one of those things where like
I've seen what psychedelics can do to really be used as medicine and so I I
think they're they're great for everything like you can either do them as
just hey I'm dancing at a festival with 9,000 people right now and I just want
to just see butterflies everywhere or I need this deep rooted trauma to come out
of me in some way and I don't want to use prescription pills or 20 years of
therapy to do it so I'm gonna take an eighth of mushrooms or do an ayahuasca
ceremony and just and then buy like really like you can have that kind of
effect sure yeah there's a damn there's millions of stories of people like that
I mean that's why you know there's psychedelics have been around for as
long as humans have been around and you hear these stories of people using them
you know like you know the the the trips the what are called the spiritual
journeys that like the Native Americans used to go on and things like that where
they would just you have to go find yourself and all you would have is like
a pile of peyote and they just drop you naked in the woods for a few days and
you come back a man and this is like a thing that has been around forever so
it's all about just like using them in a very smart way and not trying to push
them on other people like people come come to them when they're ready you know
what I mean yeah that makes a lot of sense yeah maybe you're not ready I'm
already stumped you I'm not ready I mean JJ Abrams who flunked out of
skateboarding is already stumped everybody yeah dude sorry I love it
you with a little one I hope there's more to come sure so how could you
compare Florida so far to LA so right now it is a very different place because
LA is still very much closed I think we're only at 25% capacity right now
for things so immediately when you get to I mean Florida always has this air of
recklessness to it and you know you know Florida is the butt of a lot of
people's jokes and people wonder like why does so much crazy shit happen in
Florida and I've always just thought dude this humidity fucks you up in ways
that you don't begin to understand until you live in it for a long time and I
really think that's why you see all these stories of like Florida man tries to
wrestle an alligator in the middle of a Starbucks and you're like well why would
he do that and it's like because eventually like you know I do think this
heat and the stickiness just gets to you it feels like a warm sock here and I do
love Florida just because it's a different type of people here they are
it is kind of more free even though it is a lot more religious at the same time
but that's what I think is so funny about like people here that don't want to
wear masks because so many of them are super religious and I'm like you love
God yet you seem to defy every message he sends to you through the universe
yeah I'm just like I don't really get where it all comes from but you know I
was just in Miami and it's yeah I mean Miami is oh is somebody said to me in
Miami they were like I feel like my this guy was from Germany he was visiting
Miami and he goes I think Miami is the real America and I was just like this
is the furthest thing in the world from what America is yeah this is a this is a
beef though we're in the middle like we're in the middle of the French
Riviera or something right now this is not fucking America by any means yeah but
I thought that's so fun that's what I was like not you got to go to Kansas or
something yeah it's the furthest thing from fucking America yeah but it's fun
here dude like you know it's I always have a good time when I come here I like
the people here I like the crowds at all my shows and I like just like running
around Florida it's a good time yeah well this part of floor is so much
different than Miami Miami so Miami's almost like LA as far as like the amount
of people there and how bad traffic is oh yeah and how like everyone like I
mean LA is not full of people on the streets like Miami but yeah it's very
there's this there's this there's a very vain section Miami's weird because you're
either like a billionaire or you are the poorest person I've ever seen in my
entire life like I didn't I like I don't know the area right so I'm just like
exploring and I get off it I'm just I'm I get off a train to walk to this area
called Windwood which is known it's the Windwood walls super cool like they're
just these giant murals for like six square blocks and it's on the use of my
Google Maps that says get off the train here and walk 20 minutes to the Windwood
and I'm like okay I get off the train and I immediately see a guy shooting up
into his wrist he was vaccinating himself that's yeah I guess that's an
action that's the thing I mean I felt so bad for him I was like I got to help this
guy so I showed him a bigger vein on his leg like this is this is easier come on
man your wrist but like that's it was one of those things where I was I was
walking I don't look I don't I grew up in Baltimore and I have been to in
downtown Baltimore often I used to skate down there when I was 17 people like
why did you do that weren't you afraid I was like a 17 year old white kid on
rollerblades is the last thing anybody thinks has money so no I was never
afraid but like walking through that area of Miami and I was wearing this is
the spring of like rainbow bathing suit and a fanny pack and I have my headphones
on and I was like I'm a fucking mark right now you wouldn't believe and I'm
looking around it all I do not make eye contact do not engage anyone just walk
through here as quickly as possible but I and then you know and then five
minutes later you're like at South Beach and you would never know that that
area was right there because most people just avoid it but and I'm just you
live you learn yeah it's a beautiful place here Florida about the keys you're
spending time in the keys only once I went to this place called I vacationed
when I was like in 10 years old maybe place called ducks key ducks yeah yeah
yeah I remember I spent like a week in like a resort there mostly though like
when I used to come down here my grandma lived in st. Pete in this little town
called Gulfport so we would go down there and stay in her senior living apart
meant building you know where we are like it's my brother and I and my sister
and we're all you know like you know between five and 11 years old and
everyone else in the building is 90 like everyone has plastic on their couches
and their apartments all smell the exact same they all have that mothball like
just but I used to love coming down here just because when you grow up in
places like Maryland and then you come to Florida you're like oh this is
tropical this is like so different it's cool yeah especially in an old folks
home I mean I mean that's that's that is Florida that's nice some people here
yeah except we have except I heard to I heard not well recently that Florida
has like the lowest rates of all the coronavirus statistics less like low
death least amount of deaths least amount of infections least amount of all that
crap did you get that from Fox News what are you watching here I didn't fact I
didn't fact check it bright part is like hey we see you that's how we get in
Florida's Fox and bright part dude I mean I went this was my fiancee before I
came out here she's like hey Alex just prompt I've been on the road this month
and I've you know she knows that I've been partying because I haven't been in
so long and you know sometimes like locals or comedians will take me out
afterwards and she was like just do me a favor don't like invite people back to
your hotel rooms just like be smart and I know you're I know you're gonna be
partying and stuff just be smart and then the other day I was like I found an
all-you-can-eat sushi buffet and I was like well I am not gonna tell her that
I'm coming here I like do you Chinese buffets used to be one of my vices I
like Chinese buffets I love them dude they're one of those things where it's
just like I I'm I work I keep take pretty good care of my body because I
destroy it in certain different ways I really try to be good to my body in my
brain like I read a lot I meditate I exercise every day you can't be like
like a fat piece of shit smoking cigarettes and just being a moron if
you're gonna do those things that I do yeah there's a balance you gotta balance
it out yeah balances everything for me but like I told her I was gonna be doing
like I'm that all you can eat buffet I was like oh my god like I thought this
would never have come back again yeah I really thought I would never eat at one
of those for the rest of time and then I come to Florida I'm like oh they're open
they never closed yeah and you can just go and get food and they're like you
must wear gloves and I was like that's the only thing change you have to put on
little plastic gloves like this yeah perfect now you can eat with your hands
that's it dude everyone in Florida is trying to give me a plastic bag I bought
like one drink and they put it in a bag like I don't want this bag and I was
like realize I was like wait man I'm gonna LA and like sell these for like
$40 each we can't have those in LA oh really those are rare out there oh yeah
you can't they're illegal really Los Angeles yeah you can't give a plastic
bag for like almost anything oh yeah it's at least not those super super cheap
ones that you find here yeah those are I guess yeah I mean it's really hard it's
really hard for a baby to suffocate you go the quickie mart you get the nice
black ones where you can't see what's in the bag are all your friends leaving LA
all I hear everywhere on online is all these podcasts all the comedians are
talking about leaving LA everyone's leaving a lot of people left most of my
friends are still there I have a very good I have a very good community
outside of comedians of people that you know they're my my friends that I
travel with and festival with and all this other stuff go to concerts together
so we have a very pretty good group and no one was ever thinking like we got to
get out of here because we just love the city and we love the community we've
built there and so I really didn't ever like the thought crossed my mind but
honestly the more people that left LA I was watching my time slots at comedy
clubs tick up up up up and I was just like oh cool instead of being at 1245 I
just got to 1115 they're not they all closed right now but they're well
they're gonna open like you know they're starting to do like patio stuff and like
outdoors things are coming back and so the thing is they're not gonna be closed
forever and some people think that LA is like LA is done it's never gonna come
back of course it will like it's Los Angeles is a thriving city in so many
ways other than just entertainment and the people that live there like to go do
things it's one of the reasons I like living there is because like if your
favorite band is going on tour they might go to Tampa maybe that's a chance
you're definitely gonna go to Los Angeles so like that's my like honestly
like some of the hardest decisions I've had to make in LA are like oh my god
these two bands are playing on the exact same night how do we catch half of
one and go to the other like yeah I mean you know it's first world problems for
sure but I mean that's that's why I love living there is because there's never a
shortage of shit to do yeah it's so fun yeah yeah last time I was there I was
driving on the highway to in and out and the highway was on fire and people were
just the cars were just casually going around it not even looking not even
batting an eye and a block down the street there was new construction going
up there building these wooden apartments apartment buildings every day in LA
well that's how I felt about Miami too as I see these brand new high-rises
getting built on Miami Beach I'm like aren't these gonna sink in 12 years like
you're building this giant building oh yeah did you have fun when you visited
LA the last time I went well I was I stayed in Joshua tree oh okay that's
very different so on the way home I stayed in LA for the for one night
before you didn't do psychedelics out there no that's why most people go out
there the Joshua tree yeah I know I know I just found that out but I went there
for a friend's wedding oh cool so he was just getting married out there we
stayed out there for probably a week and just like hung out and kicked it and did
his little wedding and did you enjoy the desert I did enjoy the desert I love the
desert I love how the fact I love the fact that it's like it's freezing at night
yes and it gets like pretty fucking hot during the day like it's such a
difference contrasting the hot and the cold during the time of day yeah it's
one of those things where I never thought I was like you cuz growing up when you
think of the desert you just think of the this endless sand pit with nothing
there and I didn't realize that no like the desert's actually a beautiful calm
like very peaceful place and it's filled with beauty just because like I mean the
sunsets out there are so amazing and there is really cool landscapes and
things like that going on and anything that lives in the desert is resilient as
fuck so like it's it's it's really cool going out to those places California is
one of the most beautiful places I've ever been I mean all the way down from
like San Diego Chula Vista even up north like Santa Cruz I love all those
places the one thing I noticed about Joshua tree though recently when I was
there is the whole place I don't know if you've ever spent any time like in the
water in the ocean like diving or anything like that but the whole entire
desert looks exactly like the ocean floor mm-hmm like it looks like it used to
be underwater yeah I don't know I mean that part probably was at some point I'm
guessing I've been on a lot of like dry lake beds and things like that yeah
definitely like you know hundreds of millions of years ago this was a fully
formed lake I mean the thing about North America is most of it at one point was
underwater and there were like fowl hundreds of thousands of lakes and
things like that that are now dried up just because as the land rose as the
land top topography rose up the water was forced down and so then places
emerge that were suddenly not underwater anymore right I've heard of like
there's been like crazy cataclysmic events that happen where like like half
of the United States was underwater because of a some sort of asteroid would
hit and would cause an iceberg to fly across the country and one would melt
somewhere and end up underwater and then now it's not so yeah I mean I can't
really talk any more on that that is not my area I know enough to be like yeah
it used to be underwater sounds good okay cool but it looks just like a the
ocean floor like exactly like the like the ocean floor especially like all
little trees everywhere they all they all it looks just identical yeah what I
realized I couldn't imagine tripping and being out there it's a lot what I
remembered when I first went to Joshua tree and really when I went to
California as a whole is that I used to grow up like read like all of us did
reading Dr. Seuss books and I always thought like well these like these trees
that I'm seeing in Dr. Seuss books there are they're not right now right but
they're not real trees like there's no trees that look like that in Maryland so
I just thought like they're not real and then I came to California I was like
they're all real trees that star are out here yeah have that type where we live
but yeah I mean don't even get me started on the he live out there I don't
know but I mean there's definitely a lot of Joshua trees in his books for sure I
think he lived there yeah that would make sense he definitely had a house
somewhere I know he had one house in California I remember being there one
time and someone was like we were out surfing somewhere and someone's like
see that house in the cliff that's Dr. Seuss's house interesting then there's
like an elevator going down where was that he's from Connecticut or New
Hampshire I remember because where was it I flew into I was doing shows in like
Missouri or in in Springfield Massachusetts I think that's where he's
somewhere around there and I flew into Connecticut and they had all this Dr.
Seuss stuff because I guess that's his hometown but I'm sure eventually he made
the trek to California yeah he had to have been balling yeah if you have a
dude if you have money California is the greatest place like you know if you
don't it's fine it's hard but if you do it's wonderful just money to burn yeah
go out there literally burn on the side of the freeway while everyone drives
around it oh my god there's still any fires out there it's not fire season
right now right now I don't believe so I don't think anything's burning but ask
me in six months yeah and yeah it gets I mean there's it gets really bad I mean
dude there were some days early on when the pandemic first started it for first
of all in LA it rained for a straight week which is very rare for it to rain
that much in LA and it was really we all kind of felt like okay we're really just
supposed to stay inside right now like they really know what the world the
universe does not want us to go outside right now so just stay inside but then
there were a few days over the summer where the fires were so bad that
literally like if you opened your phone it said like close your windows don't
exercise outside don't be out there for prolonged periods of time and I mean I
couldn't I am like I for exercise like I usually I play tennis I hike and I
slackline and I couldn't do any of those things because they were all required
being outside for a long period of time so it was that period was rough for
like a couple weeks like I don't go to gyms anyway but nobody could go to gyms
and nobody could be outside so I was just in my I was like doing prison
workouts in my home like in my one bedroom apartment just like doing as
many push-ups as I could all day like just like I swear to God when I'm out man
I'm gonna kill little poochie like I'm like you get all juiced up yeah I had
nothing better to do I was like I saw I looked started looking at videos of
people that put the put up slack lines in their own apartments and I slacklining
it's like it's like tightrope walking so it's like you take a piece of climbing
webbing and you tie it between two trees and then you like you you can walk on
it you can bounce on it some people do like tricks on it there's a there's a
lot of different disciplines for it but it's essentially you bet you're
balancing on a one-inch piece of rope I can see you doing that yeah when people
learn that I do that they're like yeah that makes sense and yeah I that's the
thing like Groban Baltimore I kind of always knew I wanted to live in
California like so I went to school in Pittsburgh and I started doing acting
stuff and I started getting in like a couple like small movies and things like
that so I joined the screen actors guild and I was like dude I gotta I'm 22 years
old I'm going to LA I'm gonna try and see what happens instead of being the you
know maybe in one thing a year in Pittsburgh and a really small part let
me go try to go do this thing and I got there and I always knew I wanted to
live in California there was something about it I mean maybe I was a skater for
a long time and like you just you there's a lifestyle element to like living
there that was always just so attractive to me I have I love Baltimore I loved
Pittsburgh but I knew I wasn't gonna stay in either of those places my whole
life you know yeah no I always felt the same way called me and then I just let
it now I'm just like oh yeah so they don't want to do a sound bath later like
what do we what are we doing guys let's go out to the desert and just rig up
some slack lines and you know I'm just I just I let it take me over man I don't
care I'm unashamed that's awesome yeah what is it what is it with stand-up
comics and in acting what why is it why are they all stand-up comics it seems
like majority of them going to acting or the or vice versa so the thing is like I
I I was born to be a stand-up comic and I understand that now but growing up I
really didn't know what I wanted to do and I was a I was a really piece of shit
kid I had like so I grew up with really horrible eczema like I mean like I would
go to doctors and they would basically just apologize to me I was hospitalized
multiple times as a child because my skin would break out in like staff
infections and I mean like like I looked like a decrepit leper like my skin was
falling off me it would like be like oozing pus and stuff like that like it
was really just uncomfortable painful and I I I was against the world because I
thought the world was against me and so my mom kind of started getting me into
acting stuff like as I got older my skin got a little bit better but it still had
a lot of problems but it figured out ways to make it more manageable there
were new drugs coming out that made it a little better and so she my grandmother
was an actress and she's like I know you're so animated and you're so have
so much energy we just need to do something with it so I started doing
acting stuff and it was okay but I liked it but when I found stand-up it was like
oh like this and now I get to control the words that I say all of these thoughts
that I have I can actually craft them into things that I they're hopefully
funny that I want to tell the world and I think that's why like stand-ups become
actors because we are good at just being realistic and improvisational and we're
good at being ourselves and we can act as well like a lot of not everyone can
but actors that become stand-ups usually are not good stand-ups I'll say that
that's really it's they're completely different disciplines so most actors that
try stand-up are terrible but most stand-ups that try acting are kind of
fall into it a little bit maybe it's because we're used to saying the same
shit again and again like you know I mean I have jokes that I've been doing
for a couple years just because I haven't been able to lay them down into
something yet and some of these jokes I've said hundreds of times you know and
I can so we learn how to say this shit but make it feel fresh and I think people
see that and realize like oh yeah you'd be good to act in this part that I have
you know yeah so a lot of people in LA a lot of actors are told to do stand-up
because they're like you got to go do something else like you gotta you know
they want to know what you're doing improv you're doing stand-up you're doing
sketch you're a writer so people try to put on all these different hats and for
me as soon as I became a stand-up there was a very clear like line for me where
I use like I'm an actor who just stand up and I remember there was a very specific
day where I was like I'm not an actor anymore like I will act when it's called
for but I'm a fucking comic and this is what I want I I realized that that was
the group I wanted to be associated with these degenerates who just you know
are brilliant thinkers and like live their own lives and run their own race
and they really they collaborate but they don't rely on other people to give
them work that's kind of the beauty of it like acting you have to wait till you
can create your own projects but really you're waiting to get booked on
something to get till you make get that role and otherwise you go in like I've
done guest stars on sitcoms and shit like that and I go in there I have like
two lines it's not fulfilling to do that you know it's a good paycheck and it's
fun to see yourself on TV and people see it and they're like oh my gosh but like
it's way better to be like oh yeah I wrote this entire thing that you're
about to see and I'm gonna perform it for you and then I'm gonna travel around
and I can change it as I see fit there's just so much more to it and that
lets my creative juice just fly yeah especially not mean I feel like so many
people just have their bios you'll see just like actor comedian entrepreneur
they have all these fucking things and it's insane I feel like being in a stand
up comic would be like the the holy grail and and I got like acting gigs
would just be like icing on the cake or something like that that's how I look
at it like I mean the thing about like again LA does that to you they make you
think that you're never doing enough because no matter what they're like
okay so I see you have a podcast you have a pilot script written you're in a
sketch group you do stand up you act what else are you doing with yeah and
it's just like one of the things where you there's this huge like I mean everyone
is trying so hard to just figure out their place in in out there and the
thing is that you just it just takes time and you can't for so many years like
we started talking about festivals and things like that there was a lot of years
where I was going to festivals but I was like I will never put my festival self
into my comedy self like I'm keeping these things separated because I can't
go on stage wearing these crazy outfits and like you know like there were so
many reasons why I didn't want to show that side of myself to like the world
where I was like this is who I am in these specific weekends and it's my
freedom I'm cage-free and then one day I did it in 2016 I was at a really small
festival doing comedy like my friends put it together it's like 500 people on a
dry lake bed like out in the Mojave Desert and I was wearing this outfit
that was a red unit hard with fur that I found a good will and a tail and I
looked at my friend and I was like dude what if I like went on stage like this
and he was just like would you and I was like I mean I would I would roast battle
in this and at the time you guys know roast battle is so I just like is that
we're talking about with like what's the kids name David Lucas does yeah
David Lucas does it sure but like so it mainly known like start at the comedy
store as Tony Hinchcliffe Hinchcliffe has done it a bunch of times and his judge
did a lot but yeah he's a roaster obviously Jeff Ross is a big part of it
he's the one that got the show on Comedy Central but basically two comedians go
head-to-head talking shit on each other right and then the audience decides or
judges decide who wins and I kind of fell into doing that in a really
backwards way where I never I saw I used to go to the show and watch it I was
like this is insane the energy is out off the hook people at a normal comedy
show will laugh they might hit the table a little bit they might clap they might
woo at roast battle people were slamming the fucking wall when a Joe kid
they would chop his fucking head off and this is happening Tuesday night at
midnight so I was like this is how did Tuesday become the best fucking night of
the week this is incredible so I started doing it and very quickly realized
that I was good at it I was a good joke writer and so for over over a year I was
the number there's rankings right yeah top 50 rankings I was number one for over
a year and I started to get bored because the the analogy that I always use
is like I was really good at Mario Kart as a kid I was really good I played like
all the time as my favorite video game but I was always in the lead so the
only thing I would ever do was just toss a banana peel behind me and just keep
trying to be in the lead but it's not fun to be in the lead it's fun to chase
you want someone ahead of you that you can be good gunning for so I started
thinking of all these ways where it's like how can I make this how can I like
not set myself up to lose but how can I just increase the difficulty level and
change the game and so I had a title bout against my friend Pat Barker and this
is like November 2016 and I was out at this festival and I was like dude I'm
gonna fucking battle wearing this and my friend that's a huge my friend Jeff
Chong who loves the show was like do it the get fuck yeah do it so you're just
handing him ammunition exactly well that's the way I looked at it right I was
like I'm gonna go out there like an animal and I went out there in a trench
coat had with electronic music playing and I have this and I had all my friends
like throw glow sticks at me from the audience and shit as soon as I drop the
trench coat and I'm standing there wearing this unit hard that is so
form-fitting and this blue glow in the dark tail that I put lights on and and
everyone was like what the fuck is this because everyone knew who I was like I
done this so many times and Pat Barker was is such a good joke writer we're
still very good friends he was flabbergasted he had no idea what to do
and I threw him off somebody because I also I wasn't talking like this I was
like ooh it's Pat Barker everyone look at him fat porker what's your name again
like doing this like stupid voice and I I beat him and people didn't expect me
like he didn't expect me to and even Jeff Ross was like Pat take a second just
fucking look at him right now just stop don't worry about your jokes look at
this fucking asshole and what he's wearing right now and people thought
half the community was like that was the most brilliant thing I've ever seen in
roast battle you just leveled up what we're allowed to do here and half the
people were like you cheated that wasn't you and I was like 100% that's
actually and what I realized is that's the most fucking me I've ever been on
that show yeah I was just having fun and being silly there was no aggression or
anything like that and then right after I did that Jeff I got a call from Comedy
Central literally a month later saying that I was gonna be on season two of
roast battle like I was one of the 16 people selected to go to the main show
and that was this moment where I was like okay so I do this thing two months
later I'm on Comedy Central I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I want from now on
and I'm gonna start incorporating all this silly world shit that I play that
people don't really know about into my comedy and I don't go on stage all the
time like wearing that shit like the really extravagant costumes like what I
wear on a GT and stuff like that that's very much like just for that but I will
go on stage wearing like you know kimonos and things and just like and I
was scared for a long time to do it I was really scared because I thought how is
anyone gonna take me seriously if I'm wearing this shit and what I realized
is people actually find me more authentic and more genuine because even if
you wouldn't wear this you're looking at a person who very much knows who they
are and it's very comfortable with themselves so you listen to them because
you're like okay well whatever this guy's doing he knows who he is so he's
coming from a place where of truth and that's everything in comedy once and
that's when I figured out like I can do whatever I want I can be whatever I want
as long as it comes from my heart and then bam from that day on I was like
this is game over game over everybody wow I'm running I'm running order the
kimonos now but yeah dude it was such a defining moment for me and yeah and and
then it also though for the show because it also like if you watch season two of
roast battle every single person on there is pretty much you know some couple
people wear some fun outfits and stuff but I was like I'm gonna play a different
game here and this is gonna be you know I showed people that like it doesn't have
to be two fat guys wearing flannel calling each other rapists like we can do
better than this and so yeah I think of the show I just think of like how do you
make the show better and the more entertaining I am the better the show
is that's incredible so what is like the is there a different mindset or
preparation when it comes to like roast battles versus like regular stand-up
yeah it's it's so different because like roast battle is so specific like you
know if I you know if I look at you guys I have to start really like looking at
UK did they remind me of anybody like that's why I dropped like JJ Abrams if
he flunked at skateboarding you know honestly you look like if Colorado
opened the meth dispensary you know it's I have to kind of just I look at you
and I sum you up as quick as possible but then what really good roasters do is
you learn about the person I would start researching you I would listen to your
podcast I would figure out little tips that other people would have no idea of
knowing because then I can make it even more personal and the jokes are very
specifically catered and the whole thing is you want them to hit hard and you
want them to be fast for the most part like word economy is everything make it
as short as possible but stand-up is totally different than that because
you're not writing about a specific person well you are I mean yourself a
lot but you're and your relationship to the world but what roast battle did for
me is it made me go every I need to have so many more jokes in my stand-up like I
don't ever want to if I say a line the next line has to be a joke and even if
the bit is five minutes long it needs to contain 20 jokes within that five
minutes instead of building to just one thing over the course of a story or
something like that right so it made me such a better writer and then I was
able to incorporate that into my stand-up and anyone will tell you just
because you're a good stand-up doesn't mean you're a good roaster and just
because your roaster doesn't mean you're a good stand-up I happen to have found
that I can use my skills for both but if I turn on my roasting brain it is a
little different than me just doing stand-up mainly because I really like I
consider myself very empathetic compassionate kind I really come from a
place of love so if I don't know that I have the okay to like roast you guys a
little bit I'm not gonna do it because most people don't want to be made fun
of yeah it's like their worst nightmare for me I fucking love it yeah it made me
love myself hearing of myself be called a billion different names has and I can
tell you I mean you don't give you some good good ones like my very first roast
battle ever this one hurt me the most it's guy and this guy Jason Van
Glass with my first roast battle said Alex looks like two face if two face was
one face and I stood there and I thought I would be okay with it but here's the
thing it's not it's not that you don't know what you look like it's the moment
when a hundred people laugh at you because of it and you're standing on
stage being laughed at it is such a different beast than what stand-up is
because standard yeah they're laughing with you you're right jokes roast battle
I tell everyone this before they do it you are going to be laughed at and you
need to understand that you're about to be bullied and yes you can fight back you
can have redemption you can rebuttal and get them back even harder but just
understand you're about to have the fucking guts pulled out of you in front
of people and I've had that done on live television like it is brutal so it
made me really go like okay what who can hurt me then who can hurt me right
after doing something like that and dude I don't know so if you've never watched
what I've done on America's Got Talent in 2018 they recruited they looked at they
went to roast battle and they said we want someone to come and roast the judges
and so they had a few of us auditioned and I said look I want to do it but let
me show you how I want to do it and I showed them the character with wearing
my tail and all that and I was like look for a show like this this is how it's
gonna work you can't just have me looking like an angry fucking you know
retired porn director up there just like hey Heidi Klum you're fucking dumb
bitch like it's gonna look awful but if you do it like this and make it really
silly it might work and so I went out there and it's it's a theater of 3,000
people right and you know this is the biggest stage I've ever been on this is
the biggest show pretty much in the world essentially and I went out there and
had my ass handed to me harder than any person I pretty much know has ever had
on stage for seven straight minutes the audience booed and screamed at me
violently to get off the stage and the judges are pressing their buzzers one by
one and I'm I start with Tyra Banks and I'm just going down the line and after
every single person they're just like buzz and the people like I can see
everybody and they're all holding their hands up in giant X's they're screaming
at me I can't even hear myself think but Simon is laughing his ass off and won't
press his buzzer so I'm up there you're supposed to be there for two minutes I
was up there for seven it was awful and I walked off stage and finally like you
know it was all over I got through it and I just like walked off stage and I
was like what is that gonna look like I was so I cried on the way home because
that level of negative energy is impossible to avoid it was swirling
through me like I had done the worst drug I've ever done in my life I felt sick
like I thought I was gonna throw up and it took days to get it out of me and I
didn't air for two and a half months for two and a half months I'm going what
the fuck am I gonna do what is this is if they air this I'm fucking finished like
I'm gonna look terrible people are gonna think I like I'm just I don't know what
it's gonna look like and then it aired and the internet fucking spoke up and
they were like this is legendary we've ever seen on this show because it got
it's not for the people that watch the show yeah it's for the people that don't
watch the show those people on the internet so they started sharing the
clip going dude look what he did to these people he went out there and
shoved it in their face and these people are in love with the judges or
something yeah a hundred percent dude yeah they're like they're those kind of
crowd we're like the people that love that show love it so much right they
don't want you to talk down on it and of course I look at their idols dude their
icons and so I was like and so suddenly realized and they at the thing is the
show really respected what I did because they understood the value of it you
have to either kill on that show or do something extremely memorable in a
really different way you can't be middle of the road because middle of the road
doesn't make good TV and they realized that what I had done had never been done
on that show before and next thing you knew like they edited in a way where I
just look like I know exactly what I'm doing you can't tell that I'm freaking
the fuck out inside of me yeah so man I got off that show but like so then all
of a sudden the views started popping and I mean it's now I think all of my
clips on that show have like over a hundred million views in total just
because awesome yeah because that show is so it's so big but that clip got passed
around all the people that don't watch it but then this year they invited me back
to do it all over again because they realized there was merit in it and the
judges were like I was like they don't know what's coming this time they can
handle it so the judges that were hitting the buzzer why were they hitting the
buzzer because they thought because I'm talking shit dude like I did I started
the first thing I the very first thing I said was to Tyra Banks who is the host
and first of all I come out there with and I say I'm here to inspire the world
through happiness positivity and comedy and they're all cheering like
everybody's yeah Mel B the Spice Girls like I love this yes and then I turn to
Tyra Banks and I said Tyra you have so much courage it must be so difficult to
host a show like this and still find a way to make it about you and everything
from there yeah and everything from that point on was like oh fuck like it was
you know Mel Mel B I said like a scary spice feeling scary than you is your
solo career and then the the one I got the most flack for which is one of my
favorite jokes I've ever written I said Heidi Klum you are magical for children
yet your body appears that you haven't paid attention to any of them and she
looked at me and just went bam and buzzed so quick like but Simon was ready
for it he was ready to take it yeah that's awesome he talks shit on people
he does that I was like these people ruin people's dreams all day they these
people come out on stage thinking that they're about to have their life
changed and they just look at him go you're terrible yeah that's soul
crushing if you're not expecting that but someone like me who's had been
through the ringer of Rose Battle so many times I was like you know I'm alright
you know it hurt no yeah but to it also I was like oh well now I'm resilient
like nothing like that is ever gonna happen again who that's what I think
about is like who can say they've been booed by that many people like
individually because even like a sports teams you're with a team of people you
go to another city and that city's like hates you but you're with your team
right there's you and all your boys right I was by myself that's gotta be an
insane feeling oh the worst but to get back come back this year and be able to
do it again right I didn't have an audience really made the quarter finals
this year I was in the top 25 so like it was one of the things where it's like I
got mine yeah because and I made people understand that this is something to be
valued and that's really what happened when I hit the internet is people said
like don't all these people like these the celebrities shouldn't be upset then
who is this guy they've had 40 year careers of nothing but success they have
so much money they have everything why do they care that this little fucking a
tail is saying these things to them you know and that's that's kind of the
beauty of it and kind of like sparked conversation of like you know shake
things up dude is he gonna be the same pant judge judges this time when you go
I already did it oh yeah I did 2020 I did it I ended up doing two performances
but my first one was on March 14th which is when lockdown started so I'm so now
I'm in the exact same theater and now I'm looking at instead of Heidi Klum was
sick so she wasn't there Mel B had been cut off a couple years ago so now I'm
looking at Hallie Mandel Sophia Vergara who I fucking love more than any I'm like
she is my dream woman and Simon and in the same 3000 seat theater there are
now three people looking at me oh and I'm doing and I'm doing the same thing
that's weird too awful yeah right yeah just again like I'm like this is this is
I was ready for this experience I was ready for these people I was ready to
laugh in their goddamn face and flip my fucking tail at them and just like and
because they weren't there though they also could really understand what I was
doing yeah and they could hear the jokes properly and really it made it so
they were like they were all like this is really funny this is great and so then
I just kept moving through and the final performance that I did on the show for
the live shows was one of the things I'm most proud of in my comedy career and I
read I won't ruin it but I basically I read a storybook of roast jokes to them
with illustrations of the jokes popping up on a giant screen behind me and it's
I'm so proud of it and I really feel like I got mine and that show as many
people the good thing as many people shouldn't go on that show you have to
make it work for you and I found a way to make it work for what I wanted to do
without having to compromise who I was right yeah I was very long-winded I'm
sorry I took all that time that was great what a great fucking story man what
up so what is it your process of coming up with new shit do you I mean how much
do you recycle old shit when you go around like you're on tour right now
yeah like are you going basically to every single club are you doing like
basically the same set but or a lot of similar jokes just because like obviously
I can't write new things for every city but I do I the first like my usually I
throw things about the city yeah we're in there like right now I have a few
jokes about Miami and stuff like that like I I'll be honest with you guys for
as an easy target right yeah it is yeah when I said like when I said that thing
about the guy shooting up into his wrist I showed him a bigger vein on his leg I
wrote as soon as I saw that happening I wrote that joke and I was like I'm gonna
use this for the rest of my Florida show probably just for the rest of shows
for a while yeah just because I liked the joke so I will come up with new stuff
and I do it's really a matter of like if this working right now or do I need to
pivot into some other things that aren't working because sometimes you are
within a crowd and they're not picking up what you're throwing down so you have
to figure out how to shift and move but I've done comedy in a bunch of different
countries so I'm used to having to pivot like you know what works in LA wasn't
necessarily gonna work in Bangkok wasn't gonna work in Buenos Aires and see
really do a show in Bangkok I did yeah what the fuck was the story behind how
did you do that I was going to Thailand and I hit up a friend of mine Tom Rhodes
who has done all comedy all over the world he's been doing it like 37 years
and he basically just told me he's like he's like if you ever are in a place in
the world and you want to do a show ask me who to talk to and so he hit me up
and I was like and I he gave me a show and I was like I was going there with my
fiance and a couple friends and I was like let's I was like we're gonna do
this show so let's fucking rage and figure out what it's like to do comedy in
Thailand wow it's all expats it's like people from all over the world all
different age groups but I mean there are people in the crowd from Germany from
Thailand from the UK from France from America and you know sometimes you have
to explain a little bit more about a reference or something like that but for
the most part you just try to be funny and you just do it and when a joke is
really good it should be universal it should be ubiquitous it shouldn't
have you shouldn't have to cater specifically like what I just did in
Nebraska three weeks ago should still work here in Florida yeah you know
yeah otherwise it's really not that good of a joke yeah wow that's gonna be
crazy yeah I never even thought about going to different countries and deal
dealing with like different cultures and that kind of stuff but Thailand you're
right it's like it's like a melting pot of it's like like Vegas yeah Vegas is
difficult to play like I've only done it I've only I did a week there once and
literally I mean everything from a 22 year old bachelorette party to 75 year
old like people like you know from New York from people from Dubai like and
they're all sitting like at the exact same table and you're like this is hard
but it also makes you better you know and I put out a special this past year
from London because I went there in 2019 did a bunch of shows and strung
together a bunch of sets and put together like a documentary style special and
it's on YouTube it's called when does the club shut and it just shows me
running all over London just doing a bunch of shows and I'm not changing my
material I'm I mean I do a few local things obviously but I'm just showing
that comedy will work anywhere if you have good enough jokes do you use another
thing like I was saying how like acting and stand-up comics they kind of like
go hand-in-hand with those two careers what do you think is so appealing to
comics why do you think podcasting is so appealing to comics so I feel like
especially in LA every fucking comedian has a podcast honestly there's a
few things one long-form conversation is very fun I tell people that's all the
time like I asked people that haven't done a podcast before when was the last
time you sat with someone didn't look at your phone and had a conversation for
90 minutes and most people like I've never fucking done that in my life what
are you what are you nuts with another person in the room in the same room yeah
what are you crazy to what psychopaths do that and no you so you can put so much
of yourself in it you can figure out what kind of show you would like to have
and then also you can build a fan base that really understands who you are
at this day and age it used to be that celebrities were you would see them in
magazines or in paparazzi and stuff like that but you didn't know what was going
on in their private right and these days they people want to know they want to
know more than ever and we're allowing them to know as much as they would like
kind of and you know we have to decide what parts of ourselves we want to keep
private you know like my like you know my girl she stays out of all my comedy
stuff for the most part people know that I'm in a relationship but I don't I don't
like put her in videos or anything like that like she or she doesn't want to be
a part of it so she stays out of it but so there's that part of it where people
can really learn who you are and learn your personality but there's also the
analytics right is it you guys can know you guys have had this podcast for a
couple years you know where your major markets are obviously Florida but you
could be like whoa why do so many people in Minneapolis download our podcast if
we went to Minneapolis and through a live show we could plug it on the
podcast and probably sell out this show so as you start to build a fan base the
podcast becomes really important because you can then figure out where to focus
on touring and things like that for me I wanted to do a podcast for a long time
but I didn't want to just do an interview podcast because I didn't think I
could be interesting enough like I wanted a hook for it and eventually I
came up with this idea what do you mean you want to do an interview podcast were
you interviewed guests yeah I look I knew I wanted to interview people but I
wanted to make it I didn't always want to be like I didn't want to so many people
have a comedy podcast where it's just like so like tell me about how you got
started in comedy and this is this is this you guys are not as comedy
you're comedy adjacent right which is why I'm happy to talk about all my
comedy stuff on here but two comedians just talking a lot it becomes very inside
baseball and it becomes the thing that you do for other comedians a lot of
times more so than I wanted to diversify I wanted to find a way to talk
about two different kinds of people and different kinds of things yeah so what I
figured out was what is people people only knew me mostly people knew me the
world knew me as this roasting fucking bizarro head that just like you know
they they didn't know who the real me is who is very loving and very open and you
know very kind and they all think I'm this professional asshole which is fine
that's fine but I growing up with this horrible eczema I was like man like this
is this has affected my entire life this is like my thing that I have to get over
this is what I battle and what well what other people battle so then I
realized I can ask other people what their biggest flaw in life is what is
the hurdle that they have had to get over they've had to learn how to live
with whether it's physical emotional spiritual a traumatic event mental
whatever it may be what do you deal with that fucks you up the most and let's
talk about it and normalize it and laugh at it and that's when I came up with a
Kelly's heel and then I started talking to people about things like my tagline
for my podcast is the first thing we discuss is the last thing you want to
talk about really and so people come on there and talk about it you know very
dark things suicide attempts their parents being in jail you know I just
talked to somebody about their process of transitioning into a woman and they
just started like seven months ago and these are things that people want to
hear these are stories people want to hear but for the most part unless you
really know them you're not going to get to find out what's going on in
somebody's head but because I am you know who I am like as far as my
personality goes people are willing to open up to me and not everybody is I've
had I've had good friends go I'm not fucking doing that podcast dude I don't
want to put my shit out there but people that realize that we all go through
shit every single day are more than willing to talk about it openly and
the very first episode I did was with my friend Josh Adam Myers who is a great
comedian he created the goddamn comedy jam which was on Comedy Central and he
talked about so his everything was social anxiety and it was all about him
he got in a car accident with his best friend his who was a comic that I knew
as well his best friend they got they were hit by a drunk driver his best
friend died and he became a severely addicted to opiates because of it and
was afraid to be around people unless he was hopped up on a shit ton of opiates
and this is episode one right so I'm realizing like I I think this is you
got something there yeah but more so like I enjoy having these very real
conversations and I enjoy talking letting people know who I am but also
laughing about these things you know like talking to people about the
mistakes that they've made because every fucking person does it we all have
something and I love the my favorite thing is a lot of times my fans will be
like Alex like because of you I figured out what my Achilles heel is because I've
listened to these episodes and I resonate with so many of them but I've
kept it made me think well what is my thing and at first all I was thinking
was like things like oh like you know obviously depression anxiety diabetes
like your cancer like those are the things I was thinking but then episode
two my friend Chase Bernstein comes at me with indecision and I was like that's
your Achilles heel she's like oh I can't it traumatizes me when I have to if
somebody says what restaurant do you want to go to I shut down and I can't
like think anymore and I was like that's when I was like whoa like people are
gonna come at me with all kinds of shit that I don't even think about and I
always tell people like if you're gonna listen to my podcast and you don't know
where to start because at this point there's over almost a hundred episodes
of it look for either a guest that you know or a topic that's interesting to
you because you'll definitely find one of those things and you know people have
done episodes on control on you know sugar was an episode they're so
compulsive lying was the one that I released this week which is such a good
episode violated which was a girl telling a story about being raped and
heard talking about it and like there are things but the thing is like it
sounds dark and it can be but because they know I'm a comedian we also just
laugh about shit I had a fashion model on there that was telling me about her
thing was first-generation immigrant and her parents were from from Iran I think
it was Iran if it was Iraq I'm so sorry but it was and they were basically
drilling it into her like you need to be this kind of successful you need to be
this and it destroyed her to the point where she started trying to take her own
life and she's opening up about it and she goes okay so those are the first two
on the third one and I was like okay how'd you do it this time and she goes
well I the same way I tried the first few times pills and I was like don't you
know that doesn't work by now jump off a fucking building dude fucking tie some
bricks to yourself and throw yourself off a boat the pills aren't gonna work
for you like and most people would be like that's so harsh how could you say
that to a person because they know what kind of podcast they're on and that's
how you break the tension and normalize this shit I know very few people who
have not gone through serious depressive episodes especially in the past 12
months who but people are afraid to talk and when you listen to other people
talking about their problems especially when it's somebody that you might know
who they are that means the world to them and then they go oh I'm like that
person I'm not weird there's nothing wrong with me and that that's why I
like I love doing it man it's like it's literally like it's my own form of
therapy that's amazing so you do one a week yeah nice how do you find most
your demotion guest reach out to you like hey can I do an episode or do you
sometimes seek out certain people I mostly seek out people like because it
started as a ton of comedians and then I got some like some writers and some
DJs and like models and people like just people that are kind of of the field
basically like in the end because most people most normal people they don't know
how they don't want to talk about this stuff for the most part and also I've
had a few friends on there they like it has been their first podcast and stuff
like that and it's been harder for them because you can hear when someone just
really doesn't know how to talk into a microphone when they don't really know
what like how to answer a question honestly but that's why yeah comedians
musicians writers like people that generally talk anyway are very good
about it and so I just kind of think well who do I like and after like like I
listen to Chappelle AC episode of your eyes podcast today of your podcast to
get ready for this and I immediately reached out to Chappelle and I was like
dude we have so much in common with the way we do the world and how many things
we had we're in touch with and so he was like yeah I can't do it right now but
get me up in a few weeks and we'll put them together and I don't know what his
Achilles heel is yet or anything like that but you know that's I just think
about who do I want to have a conversation with and I think we'll
really give themselves to this experience and that's the thing the more
you're willing to divulge the better the episodes are the more we can laugh
about it and there's been so many hilarious fucking moments mixed in to
these super soul-crushing excruciating pain and I think that's like somebody
one of my fans recently just said you're like the roasting Oprah I'll take it
dude I'll be I'll be roast rough but yeah I was like that's that's a huge
compliment so that's why the roasting thing is so fun for me is because if
you don't know who I am you don't realize that I'm this completely paradoxical
person to what I present myself as on stage and that's just this flamboyant
character that I'm just having fun and being silly with but the real truth is
I fucking love everyone I have so much passion for humanity and I'm so
hopeful for our existence and that's what I really want to convey and I think
that's what comes off in my podcast and why people are willing to talk to me
about this shit that's fucking amazing have you ever heard of a soft white
underbelly no he's a guy his name is Mark later he's a he's a professional
photographer he used to be like working the advertising world and he used to
work for like big ad agencies he takes like all like the product photos for
Apple that kind of shit and and then basically he quit doing that and then
he opened up he bought this little studio in on Skid Row and he just takes in
homeless people and he just sits there and interviews them for 30 minutes whoa
and his channel he started it I think he started like maybe last year beginning
of last year and it's already got almost 2 million subscribers and he is like
blowing up like he gets like these people on there that just tell these
stories and it's for some reason it really connects to people like these
like he asks these people how they ended up where they are like a lot of them
homeless one guy had like a gun of shotgun wound through his face he had half
of his face missing Jesus and like the worst most fucked up people on earth
and he said the word the number one common denominator with all those people
is fucked up parents yeah it's a big one it's huge I mean the thing is those are
such informative years on you that you know from from one until like nine yeah
is your parents are your biggest influences in your life and if they are
abusive if they're dismissive if they're absent if they're if they're too
much of one thing that is all getting directed toward you in a way that you
don't know how to cope with yet and that's so difficult and so these people
learn terrible habits and they don't feel enough love early on and that is a
big thing I one of the things I love doing when I'm on the road is I walk I
just walk around cities right that's how I ended up in that shitty area of
Miami's cuz I'm just like well I don't know where I'm going I'll just walk so
I but I love if I'm not if I realize the homeless person is not at all
threatening like they go hey man can I get a can I get a dollar something I'm
like why do you want do you want some food like you want there's a hamburger
place right here you want to sit outside and just have a burger I'll buy your
burger and then I just talk to him because most people they're the biggest
thing that they're missing I mean other than pants and you know clean clothes and
things like that it's it's communication yeah they don't have a core of people to
talk to like Shane if you had a problem you would have a couple people you're
like I know exactly who I need to call right now and I got to talk this shit
out and I got buddies or I got family that can be like okay I'm calling you up
and I need you for 20 minutes or whatever these people don't have that shit
and so sometimes I'll just be a voice to them and what I find is when I'm on the
road and I talk to people because I'm good at asking questions that people
know that I'm a fleeting moment of their life that I'm not sticking around I
don't live where you are so they tell me a lot of things that people normally
wouldn't tell you I've had so I've been in Florida for a week now I have had two
women tell me the story of how they were widowed in a week and I'm just drinking
I'm just having a beer with them after a show and they feel the thing is they
feel this comfort with me because they know that I'm gonna be gone in a day
you're not judging them no I'm just listening to them right and so that
things that would be very that would take a long time for them to tell someone
that they wanted to be in a relationship with and of any kind they will put out
on me because I'm about to leave so there's this trust in strangers yeah that
you kind of just like will tell people things so that's why I think that
that's why that's so successful is because these are human interest stories
that people don't seek out otherwise it's hard to listen to a homeless person
talk about when their kids were taken away because they got too fucked up on
drugs and then they lost their job and then the house mortgage turned to flipped
on them and the stories of how those people got there are heartbreaking and
for a lot of people they can't stand to listen to them but so for someone who is
taking the time to look for them and to interview them and to just spend some
time really talking to them like a person that's the that's the most
beautiful thing when I see a homeless person I'm not always gonna give them
money sometimes I give a dollar some change whatever you know I can't give
it to everybody I'm not balling out like that but what I will always do is I
will look them in the eye and wish them the best and I'll just say like I can't
but you know I really hope you I hope you get some of today you know because
most people they don't want to look at them because it reminds them of this
part of themselves that maybe they're too afraid that they could and they're one
step one bad decision away from getting there themselves and it's scary to look
at a person who is very sick and very poor and very needy because especially
when you are opulent in so many ways and I think what most people what those
people need more than anything else is a meal and a conversation and if I have
the time dude and you're not completely crazy with I have I have I mean I've
encountered two man I mean one guy I was just like talking about a story and
he's like well there's a fucking aliens in the government didn't fucking come in
and take my brain and I was like oh this is a whole other level well that's most
people homeless are not in Florida mushrooms I mean I saw when I got off
I got I got off a bus yesterday and I immediately saw a guy that was clearly on
you know a hardcore drug addict he's like do you have any money I was like I
don't have any cash but I'd have a fresh Gatorade in my bag and you can totally
have that like that's one and he just looked at it like oh yes a cold beverage
like on a hot day in Florida that one time I a guy was like a guy approached
me an intersection in LA he's like do you have any money on you and I was like
no cuz I didn't but I had a bottle of hand lotion of cream and I was like dude
and I gave him in this and this guy looked at it like it was a fucking
hundred dollar bill was he ashy he was very ashy oh yes oh yes which another
great rose joke about me thank you Phi Phi Dash said Alex is the ashy as man
from Baltimore from a city that was burned by crackheads great fucking Joe
really good but yeah he was basically because if you're homeless that is the
last thing you're gonna spend money on is oh yeah fucking you're thinking of so
many other things you're not thinking of your skin even though it hurts yeah to
be to be that dry and that was one of those things where it's like it's those
little things giving someone a pair of socks is worth so much more than giving
them a dollar sometimes because it's the things that they wouldn't buy and you
know again I can't do it for everybody but if I have the time and a little bit
of extra I'm more than happy to give it away I have this philosophy that and it's
a lot of people's like it came it's a lot of people think like this I didn't
come up with this but whatever you give out we'll come back to you twofold
eventually so if I give a homeless person a dollar somewhere along the way I
will be rewarded with two dollars I don't know how I don't know where I don't
know when but that but it's gonna happen right if you think like that then it's
so much easier to give it you know I don't need to hoard a dollar right that
means the world to this person it means nothing to me you know so I just try to
think like that as much as I can that's amazing man have you're have you ever
done a podcast with David Lucas before we've never done a podcast together
yeah he would be I know him very well we've spent a lot of time at the
comic store together we've never battled unfortunately because David Lucas was a
rising star in roast battle was killing it but his thing his Achilles heel in
roast battle anyway was he wouldn't write he would only go off the top of the
dome really right so if when people realized he started out destroying
motherfuckers nobody knew what to do but he also then he's but then as you get
better you start to battle people who are good at it who have been doing it a
long time and look you can go off the top of the dome all day but if someone
writes a very well crafted joke about you personally you calling them look at
you you assistant nurse looking motherfucker like it's not gonna do the
same damage this person who clearly learned about you and so David and but
then David started writing jokes and his writing got so much better and his
comedy also started getting so much better because he realized that yes I do
have the power to go off the dome but now I have the know-how that I need to
come in prepared because that's what's really gonna do it you know yeah that
was that he was I think he was the first comedian we ever had on this yeah I
think so oh cool yeah super fun man I never thought it would be so fucking
fun to have an interview with a comedian before him then we got him we got
Chappelle and then we got you awesome well that's you know the thing about us is
like look I've interviewed people that are not comedians too and sometimes it's
they're great to talk to and they're very you know they have a lot of knowledge
about a certain subject but they might not necessarily be very fun to talk to
because not everyone is just cracking jokes and being silly and light hearted
and we really try to do that as much as possible so if we can make you laugh
which is in daily conversation all I want to do is make people laugh my whole
thing of existence is when you come into my life I want you to walk away feeling
a little bit better than when we came into contact with each other that's
that's my goal every time I do a thing if you came into this room and you weren't
in the best mood maybe you had a shit day at work or whatever I want you to
leave feeling a little more elevated than when you came in and when you think
about it like that it just becomes easier to just have more fun and that's my
whole thing is give love have fun that's I think about that every day give love
have fun and if I'm doing both of those things I'm leaving a fucking really good
life and I you know I have my moments I get fucking angry I get depressed I have
all that shit going through me too because there's parts of me that still
will never get over that angry little kid that I was no matter how much work
that I do there's still part of him in me but I just use him to fuel me and
that's when I roast that's when he gets to come out yeah you know all those
evil thoughts that are brewing inside me I talk about some dark shit on stage like
I have some dark fucking jokes but I get away with them because they come because
everyone knows when you watch my set they come from a place of love and when you
lead with that you're fine so you think that shit you went through when you were
a kid with the eggs and all that that fuel that's like your part of your drive
to do what you do oh a hundred percent dude that's what like I I I was always
funny because it was my only coping mechanism it was the only thing I had
going for me was that I knew I was funny and I was funny because I was angry and
because I was trying to get this energy out of me of this pain and I was always
had so much energy but I never had a way to channel it into anything and when I
found stand-up comedy the very first time I did a set on March 13th 2009 I
know that anniversary very well I don't know my relationship anniversary I
couldn't tell you I know the important one she it's one of things we're yeah
we're an hour and a half inch now listen we're in the clear now very much
though I figured but I figured I was like it was this moment of clarity where I
go oh I found it I found it this is what I've needed for so many years to learn
to explore myself to get over my bullshit and to and to give my energy out to
people instead of containing it within me and lashing out on the world and its
people and that's when I realized like stand-up comedy if you really do it well
and you really try it is a deep exploration of your relationship to
humanity and the world around you and the way you get better at that as you
learn as much as you can about yourself and the more I allow myself to dive
deep and figure out pull out all this shit that's been lodged inside of my
fucking guts for so many years the more I get rid of it the freer I become the
happier I become the happier I can make other people now and I did I did an
ayahuasca ceremony a week before the pandemic you guys know what ayahuasca
is so I did that I've never done it before he's done it a couple times you
have okay so did you throw up did you purge and everything not crazy but a
little bit the first time yeah did it pull some shit out of you though
definitely yeah definitely it's I had never done it but I done a lot of other
psychedelics and it was I did two night ceremony and I did not vomit in fact I
didn't have any bad experiences I was it was beautiful it was profound I saw
gorgeous creatures running through the running through there I've done I did it
thinking it's gonna find some more shit in me and it didn't pull anything out
and at first I was like disappointed and then I was really proud of myself
because I realized that's how much work I've done over the years to not let this
little boy fucking control the man that I am now and there's a quote that changed
my fucking life when I heard it and it's from Alan Watts who's a great British
philosopher and it was you have no obligation to be the person you were
five minutes ago when I think about that quote you have no obligation to be the
person you were five minutes ago I realized so much of what I was holding
on to was from these little angry rashed child that hated himself and the world
around him but I'm not that person anymore so why am I still holding on to
any of that you know I gotta ask what did you learn about yourself after doing
it or like what was your takeaway it was it was just like a lot of release in it
it was real similar to like the first time doing mushrooms like you said it
opens up a very different perspective on the world and everything so it was like
for that it was very similar to that type of experience it wasn't like it
brought out a lot of stuff I've been burying it but it was like it just felt
like a very peaceful release of everything he's just a very calming
feeling he smokes an enormous amount of weed so I think I don't think it you
probably didn't take enough right he's like a high tolerance oh no you don't
need too much you don't need a lot of ayahuasca dude that's such a it's so
different really oh my god yeah I mean it is like yeah that it's such a
different experience and it is six straight hours of blasting into another
universe and the thing is you do it usually in a room with like there were
like 20 people in the room that I did it in you know and it's still very much
like an illegal thing for the most part like there's ceremonies that you can
kind of find if you know the right person but most people vomit their fucking
brains out or they purge in some way and you listen to 20 people in this room
just like and the next day they're like man all this guilt and shame was just
coming up and I realized that I was a piece of shit to my first wife and then
I shouldn't have treated her like that and I'm sorry Susan I'm sorry I listen to
a girl talk about a woman say she was going I could hear her going through
some shit because you can hear people crying people screaming people you know
having the six whatever experience it's giving them this woman the next day
cuz you sit around a group and you talked about it you guys do the same
thing yeah we spent a couple days with it was just me my buddy and the guy who
was like a shaman who put the whole ceremony on it was just us three oh
gosh and a couple days in the woods with him where he lives out there and then
did it one night before we left and so it was a cool experience I mean we just
hang out and fucking played the guitar in the bongos for a couple hours and
fucking just chilled but this one we were talking about the next day in group
in a circle and you go through every you don't you're not allowed to comment on
anybody else's experience you just listen and then you talk about your own
experience you don't compare yourself to others or anything like that you know
it's very open it's very non-judgmental but this woman I knew I could hear her
having a rough time she kept asking for help from the shaman she was crying a
lot and when she talked about what happened to her she said that she was
stuck in the Holocaust where her grandmother had been persecuted and
killed and she was in basically a concentration camp experiencing
everything her grandmother went through and this generational trauma that had
been stuck in her from her grandmother to her mother to now her was coming out
of her in this very you know almost violent way because that shit had been
stuck in her for years since birth basically and then she got to release
that and I draw I drove her home she didn't have a ride home I drove her
home the next day and we talked I was like I mean she was like she was she
was still very heavy but you could tell like weight lifted you know from just
having this experience and that's the thing is people you people have all
kinds of different experiences on it but if you give yourself to a psychedelic
and you allow it to take the work that's the whole thing is you can't fight
whatever it's trying to show you you have to just give yourself and allow it to
calm and know that it's not gonna kill you you are gonna be okay just sit down
and hold tight and breathe your way through it you're gonna be fine I
always say there's no such thing as a bad trip there's challenging trips I
mean it's a bad trip if you fucking decide to get in your car and do something
really like you know but your friends fucking face off is this a hot is this
gonna hot dog let me try to eat it yeah yeah like yeah then you're having a bad
trip but as long as you're in a safe situation challenging you're gonna go
through some shit but it's gonna teach you about yourself and I think that's
the most important thing to take away from all of that is just like you know
allow the experience to happen be open and try not to be afraid of it if
possible you just got to go with the flow and that's everything in life right so
how did this girl inherit this trauma from her grandmother was it because her
grandmother like talked to her mother about it who talked to her about it or
was it generational trauma is a very real thing you know if you think there's
so much of what we are is passed down in our genetics and if you're a person who
is holding on to these horrible things that have happened to you or your family
there is a big part of that that is inside of you and a lot of that will
inherently get transferred into your kin and into other people that you know
just because of really in the same way that you you know that I have blue eyes
that person was like had part of her grandmother's Holocaust experience
within her and that is a terrifying thing especially if you don't know where
what it is and that's the thing without ayahuasca she probably never would have
learned that she was holding on to that she's just walking around thinking like
why am I unhappy why are things not you know going the way I want them to
why this why because that is part of what's going on inside of you if you
talk to a lot of a lot of minorities feel this right is they have like like
talk to a black people about they are direct descendants of slavery and stuff
like that and there is this part of them that will never feel completely free
because they have this because they came from that and it's it's just this
weird thing that we as humans like we you know that's what we get we get we get
there we get some of the stuff that they look like but we get a lot of their
personality too and part of their personality is going to be wrapped up
in the experiences they've been through and if they didn't deal with their shit
they're fucking gonna give it to you wow I had no idea that could happen yeah
dude that's insane aren't you wondering now what's going on in there
anytime you get sad it's because your dad actually killed someone with his car
with his mail truck yeah that's yeah it's dude that's you know you got to use
them properly that stuff especially that one that is a I mean that's you
know that's you got a that's that's top level you should take that on supervision
yeah the thing I like about the thing I like I like the idea of I know all the
psychedelics I like the idea of DMT the best because only last 10 minutes yeah
but it's a it's a it's a crazy 10 minutes from hell no I mean it can be I
saw the face of the devil in there once that was kind of scary but I mean I
also don't believe in the devil so I was a little nausex show me his blood
nikes but no I mean yes DMT I've talked to a lot of people who have never done
a psychedelic they're like I only want to do DMT because it's 10 minutes I was
like bro it's intense it's not it's yeah those 10 minutes are a lot if you've
never been through anything like that before cuz yeah you straight up you go
to another dimension and you there is no coming back for those 10 minutes and
that 10 minutes can feel like a lifetime and you're gonna see things that
you're not gonna be able to explain and you're gonna see and if you talk to
the people who've done DMT you're gonna learn that you see a lot of very similar
things there's you know a lot of people see elves working machines yeah like
that I've seen I have seen that like I'm the first time I did it I saw walls
literally melt down with this green slime and there were a bunch of these
little tiny guys just working like I looked like in the inside of a clock or
something they were just grinding these wheels that were just going and I was
like what am I looking at right now what is this a lot of people see the woman
in there you know mother I a mother ayahuasca like this very sensual kind of
bluish woman it's kind of beckoning you to come and like there's there's if you
look at like DMT inspired art like Alex Gray and like people that do that kind
of thing you see so much of the same thing again and again and again and
it's because you can't really explain what you're seeing but you can try to
remember very specific I only like I don't remember whole DMT trips at all I
remember about two seconds from individual ones where I'm like oh yeah I
remember that moment and thinking like where am I what is this but for the most
part you there's no way to explain it except through art and that's why you
see so many of the same images it's it's crazy shit dude I mean if you're gonna
do anything don't start with that one that's that's what I said start with a
couple mushroom caps yeah a couple caps yeah 85 milligram gummy and I'm fucking
gripping the chair like that's Danny then you know that the maybe drugs aren't
for your thing drugs are bad right like and that's you and there are there are
plenty of people who have taken drugs ago that is not what I need or what I
want I get it for me drugs and I have a connection with them and I again use them
very responsibly and where in set and setting is so important for it and if
you do that with the right people in the right situations for the most part
you're gonna have a positive experience right and you know you just have to know
that about yourself and be ready to face some shit that might come up yeah do
you ever get fucked up like super fucked up on like whatever it is like any
those psychedelics can do stand up or do you always no stone cold stone god no I
mean not stone cold sober I mean I've definitely had a few drinks or been a
little stone sometimes and things but thing is like so there's a show in
Los Angeles and it's a there's been a lot of different area iterations of the
show in other places in Los Angeles it was called performing under the influence
Pui and you do a set completely sober and then you go out back you get fucked up
on the drug of your choice and then you come back and you do another set and so
people I did the show yeah and I did the show and people were like oh my god
Alex what fucking drug are you doing I was like I have this joint I'm gonna
smoke this they're like you and I was like yeah I respect drugs too much to
perform comedy on them and they were like don't you respect comedy too much
I was like I know what I said I do I've talked to plenty of people who have
like I took acid and I went on stage I don't want to do that yeah I don't want
to entertain you when I'm on acid yeah this is my time right I feel like
especially dude if I started like if I started having any negativity at all all
I want to do is go to myself go by by myself for a little bit and just sit and
let it do what's doing to me and just kind of like get myself through it I don't
want to be on stage in front of people who are laughing at me or even if it
like you could set yourself up for some for some really bad shit and I know
people who had great sets on acid and mushrooms and on Molly and all cuts
that's the one drug if I was if I was ever forced to do it on Dr. I would do it
on Molly because I'm not actually going to like my head is very much I can talk
to you just like I am right now my body is just feeling like a million fucking
bucks and it's just like flowing through me with all the happiness but I would be
able to perform if I was on mushrooms and I just would lose myself I don't want
people staring at me that just seems so uncomfortable this may seem like a really
stupid question but do you know Mitch Hedberg course yeah he's like the
one of the first communities I ever listened to when I was really young yeah
he seems like he was always stoned out of his mind when he was doing sets he was
on a lot of stuff I mean you know he died of an overdose and he was I mean he
had a lot of demons and a lot of addictions but yeah he was he would
definitely get fucked up and do shows a lot I mean I know people who were very
close to him do you really yeah I mean Tom Rhodes who I mentioned earlier they
were roommates for a long time yeah and he you know he had to watch Mitch like
you know go through they used to you know piles of cocaine and things like
that and I'm not speaking out of place here because they have talked about that
he's talked about this very openly on other things right but like yeah they
would but people kind of knew like Mitch started to get into harder stuff and
people were trying to pull him back like you don't need that and he was kind of
in the place of like well you don't know what I need you don't know this and he
really you know he had bigger demons to face that were some that were probably
not drug related and the drugs were not helping him at some point and that's
that's one trap that well I am I very very very seldom talk about this but like
I have I have a half-brother who died of an accidental overdose and we were and he
left behind two kids and a wife and it was a horrible situation for the family
and the overdose on we think alcohol and pills we think he was he was he was he
was taking like some kind of opiate for pain and we just drank too much one night
and you know it was the it was the surprise phone call of your life that
you never fucking see coming yeah and one thing because I looked at him and I
thought about myself a lot because I you know people know me as a drug guy my
album that I put out in 2018 is called hugs drugs pugs I talk about drugs like
it's what I do but opiates I don't like I said I don't do those type of drugs I
don't do those and I wrote when I went to Burning Man in 2018 I there's a place
called the temple at Burning Man which is one of the effigies that they burn
this is beautiful structure and people go in there with letters to their loved
ones that they've lost or people that are sick or their pictures of their pets
are in there people write letters to people that have raped them and things
I mean it is it is so emotional to walk through the temple and read these things
and one of the things that I wrote in the temple was a message to my brother
that said basically like like I'm so sorry that what happened you happen to
you but you've taught me exactly what not to do as a drug user and because of
that I thank you for it and you know I'm standing in there just fucking balling
my eyes out as I write this with a Sharpie on a piece of wood and people are
just walking up and hugging you because they just read that that's what Burning
Man is people see you in distress and they'll just walk up and they'll put your
hand on your shoulder and be like you know is this okay and if you turn to
them they'll give you the fucking hug that you just you I've cried you know I
had a woman cry into me about the death of her sister that same week too she
literally just like found that she just needed somebody and she just cried all
over me for like an hour and I was like I just sat there and let her do it and
just kind of like you know stroked her hair and it was just like I'm all I can
do is be here and you just have to you know it's those moments teach you
things and I know I know where I'm not going with this my place is not to be a
zombie walking around my place is to be silly and lighthearted and fun and
loving and those drugs are not that at all yeah you know I didn't I didn't see
when I first started listening to him I didn't know anything I was like still
in high school and it was like the my first introduction to comedy and it
seemed like everything was a punchline everything was so funny and he was just
like I could tell like this guy I knew instantly this guy's fucked up I remember
the first time I heard an escalator can never be broken it can only
temporarily become stairs yeah sorry for the convenience I was like that's the
funny and the way he like draws out the word he was a prophetic genius in
the way that he wrote one-liners because they weren't you understood who he was
but he wasn't really giving up too much of himself
yeah very beautiful you know I love the ducks at Subway I went to Subway I
ordered a sandwich and it was for the ducks outside like oh don't worry man
it's on the house there are five ducks out there and they all want some chips
yeah my favorite head bird joke is um people honk their horn too much I think
people should only be allowed to three or three times a month that way if
somebody cuts you off and you go to press it and no sound comes out you're
like damn it I wish I hadn't seen Ricky on the sidewalk I fucking love that
dude yeah oh my god you know a lot of greats are gone too soon and it's
unfortunate but we have to learn from those yeah you have to look at a person
like that and say well what did he need that he wasn't getting and how can if we
see a person that we think is falling into a trap like that how can we help
them and maybe you know maybe we can pull him out maybe we can't but at least
we have to give the effort and I know a lot of his friends really fucking tried
and he was a person who he had too much going on inside him that wasn't gonna let
himself be pulled away you know that's and that sucks and I think my brother
was probably the same way no matter what even with his family and all that it
wasn't enough to truly pull him away fuck could you imagine a podcasting was
around when he was alive oh my god yeah fuck crazy I would love yeah I would love
to hear like him and a tell just go off for like two hours yeah right I'd be
