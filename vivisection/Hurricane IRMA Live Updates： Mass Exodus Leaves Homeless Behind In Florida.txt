A huge hurricane, Irma. Now moving on short, northern Cuba with the past few mollusks navigating to see the sound cluster of the eyes of y'all coming on shore.
You're going to get hit, as like in cap five, direct hit.
Cap five coming right for Tampa.
It's cap four, it's going to increase when it hits the golf.
It took a five and it's going to mollusk you.
What are you guys doing?
Fucking party it.
Oh, fucking, really?
So what are you guys doing right now?
Uh, smoking pot.
Oh, we're getting ready to get fucking plastered.
Fucking my nastards.
Start it off, tie the boats up, get ready for the hurricane, make sure the boats don't get washed away, double-tying all the lines.
Wait a minute, don't forget my friend.

Say hi.
Oh shit.

My animal Maria is closing down the island at 6 p.m. on Sunday.
So I think we got it, you know, a while ago.
And there's still people that have to get their places together.
He's got both of them.
And he's like, hey, what are you guys doing?
We're eating a piece of pizza.
The boats are pretty much tied up now.
Everyone getting prepped.
So they're tying the boats up.
That's what I was doing this morning.
There's another fisherman crossing the street over there.
That's young Chris.
Freaking.
So they're just prepping and getting the docks ready.
Because it's about to kick ass here.
Really bad.
I thought it was going up to East Coast now.
They're showing it coming this way.
Coming right at us.
Yeah.
So we're going to get fucking screwed.
You know?
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.
Anyway, I'll be on the beach as long as the cops don't fucking bust my ass.
Fuck no work.
It's like a ghost town out here.
Yeah.
Whenever they have that.
I've been here like so many evacuations.
Pussies.
You know?
But whatever.
Pussies.
Sometimes they'll bring out like the doon squad.
Like freaking black ops and shit.
Sheriff's department.
But whatever.
I'm not worried about the whole land crap.
We're going to be tripping balls here.
Like about a half an hour fucker.
I don't know if you can hang that long.
Let's go to screw these.
I'll go up there.
Fuck yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fucked up for the hurricane.
That's what we're fucking doing.
Yeah.
Totally twisted.
Totally twisted.
What?
Totally twisted.
How you doing buddy?
You know what you gotta stand for?
Look.
That means totally awesome and do it again.
Ta-da.
Ta-da.
Ta-da.
How are you guys?
How are you guys?
How are you guys?
How are you guys?
How are you guys?
How are you guys?
How are you guys?
How are you guys?
How are you guys?
How are you guys?
I feel really good.
I feel very up, up, up, up.
It's frickin.
Nally you mentioned it.
It's frickin.
It's cool.
There's still people here coming and going so.
Yeah.
It's pretty much done.
You're tied up when you come through the bridge.
If you ain't got a deputy badge then you're on the island.
The only way off is by my canoe.
That's it.
If the worst comes the worst I'm going to go up to the Hubbard's marina.
They've got a five level parking garage so I'm not going to drown.
It's hurricane fuckin built concrete solid steel.
That thing's got a handle of hurricane.
I don't think we've had one come up to West Coast since Hurricane Elena.
And I think that was like 1984, 1985.
Yeah.
85.
What's up fucker?
Party on.
Orges say of when come orgy with us on the beach, party on.
It's a frickin hurricane party.
That's what you're supposed to do.
Why do people buy bottled water when you can buy beer and alcohol?
That's just ridiculous.
Where's your drink fucker?
Where's your drink?
I fuckin left it over there.
I left it speaker and everything.
Come right here.
I got it.
Come on.
Stand right here.
Stand over.
You're a model now.
Stand right here.
So you can see the new fucking sign behind your dork bag.
Fuck that.
Yeah.
Pipe it.
Straight out motherfucker.
Fuck it.
We're going to die fucker.
Your mind is in overload frickin taking on all the going up the rails on a crazy train.
I'm going.
Almost girl.
Almost girl.
Fuck yeah.
The mushrooms are starting to work.
Fuck yeah.
I don't think so man.
I think they're far away.
Now it's 7.35.
We're driving down Indian Rocks Beach going to Gam's house.
She's going to stay on her house on Indian Rocks Beach through the whole entire storm
even though it's being evacuated.
Everybody I know that lives here has left town.
Everybody all my friends everybody I know says they either went to Georgia, Tennessee
or Chicago to ride out the storm and we're here doing it.
So what are we doing tomorrow?
We're going to board the windows up or what?
I don't have anything to board the windows.
We're just going to put plastic in the doors and hope it doesn't flood.
Hope for the best.
That's it huh?
How many hurricanes have you been through before in this house?
A ton of them.
What was the worst one?
Oh jeez.
I was going to say at least a dozen of them.
What was the worst one?
For me the worst one was a storm that didn't even have a name.
It was called the no-name storm in 1993.
It was a bag and it was just a storm not even a hurricane.
I've come to believe after experiencing hurricanes for 25 years that it's really,
I'm really not afraid unless we get a direct hit.
But this one's coming so close that I am nervous about it but I'm not scared.
If I lose everything, I lose it.
5.6 million people have been asked to evacuate.
That's crazy.
That is crazy.
I'll help you out.
I'll blow your house down.
Have you ever been through a hurricane before?
I moved here during a hurricane.
You know, I come from New York.
We have fucking blizzards.
I come from San Francisco and get earthquakes.
You think you're gonna fuck about a hurricane?
I had five people offered to send a plane to pick me up.
People would like me to fucking Arizona, fucking Tennessee.
And people would offer me private planes.
The pilots called me.
What did you say?
They told me to get...
No, I'm gonna stay here where my property is, my business.
I got hotels, apartments to look after.
I'm not afraid of a little guy who didn't win the ring.
