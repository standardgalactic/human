surfed a big surf town no I I never did it in my life I enjoy the ocean yeah I
love the waves all of that but I have never never surfed okay yeah okay so
for people who aren't familiar with your story and I know you have a book out and
then you just sold or would you you optioned your film to a big company that
optioned my life rights okay and to a company that Joe Palletto is the
producer uh-huh and he's ultimately gonna have his own platform his own
Netflix type and it's gonna happen very soon probably in a few weeks so he's
looking for lots of material he's already licensed probably hundreds of
movies so it's gonna be a mob TV like 247 oh cool yeah that's gonna be a real
and I said it's just weeks away now wasn't there also a movie or something
that you starred in that you well I didn't star in it I was a consultant to
DaNero in the Irishman oh okay and I did get a part in the movie I played a
hitman so oh wow that's recent right that movie just the last year yeah okay
right baby yeah I think last year it came out yeah so so I'm getting a little
bit ahead of myself but for people who aren't familiar with their story just
give me like a brief background of who you are where you came from you know it's
always nice to start it that way the way you did because it's such good stuff
I've got you know where I am now it's it's a blessing I have you know a
screenplay in the in the works Nick Pallegi's writing it Terry Winter is
also involved he's you know written the Sopranos and you know so many movies
like The Boardwalk Empire but you know and and what got me there was the cops
that were on my case they were part of the task force back in I guess around the
90s 90 89 90 91 our doubt DaNero's private security really so yeah after
they retired they went into that and when he was looking for somebody they all
knew me well and they says Larry's the guy you want he read the book it's called
The Life and he said it was terrific several times and he had a plan for it
but you know he's so busy and got so much going on in his life it's too slow for
me so this Joe Palletto came in and took it and and we're moving but but now go
back to what got me is you know I was a made guy in the Colombo family and I
you know I didn't start out that way I started out a normal upbringing my father
was a lieutenant fire department my mom worked in a bank you know we went to
Catholic school my brother my sister myself and you know we had everything we
wanted growing up you know not that we were rich but we were expected to do
well in school you know we were pressed to do well and I went all the way up to
college I did a year of college John Jay College criminal justice yeah that's
funny but but somewhere you know just about six months before I went to
college I met an older woman while I was working in a supermarket and her name
was Linda and very attractive and like I was not quite 18 and she was about 32
so it was sort of a mutual attraction and seduction whatever word you want to
use we wound up having an affair I found out soon after that she was married
do she had two kids but I never met the husband the husband was always gone he
was always away so I was assuming he was a businessman or a doctor just were
crazy hours that thing a little closer to you just pull it just pull towards
yeah and I can yeah anyway and ultimately I find out later on that he
is one of the bosses in the Colombo family and his name is Greg Scarpa and
they called him the Grim Reaper he had I mean he told me he stopped counting at
50 bodies and he's probably got a hundred or 200 I mean it's probably one
of the most feared mob guys in history yeah so holy shit yeah the way I found
out was no sorry interrupt when you were that age did you know anything about
mafia not a lot I knew there was these social clubs all over the place where
the guys always dress better and never worked and had the caddies that type of
thing you knew it was there but I didn't know anything about the rules or the
the real actual lifestyle the life I didn't really know what it would it
meant to be in that life until later on obviously so and I did have an uncle
Albert who was a dinosaur with the Colombo family he died at like 93 years
old or 94 years old and he was very very well liked in and out of that life he
was one of those guys that you see in like in movies that where they liked the
mob guy he was that guy Greg on the other hand was just a vicious greedy you
know ruthless mob guy so and I've wound up somewhere in between because growing
up under Greg Scarpa you had to produce you couldn't be weak you couldn't show
any weakness so I learned to be a gangster like Greg it's summer camping

having an affair with this woman who's over more than 10 years older than yes
and then you find out that she's married to a guy who's an infamous murderer how
does that not freak you out how do you not run for the hills when it did but
here's what happened she broke it like little bits and pieces she said told me
first he was an influential guy he could help you in business and they
actually put me in charge of sales their sales they had a company paper products
and fire extinguishers cleaning supplies to furnish no all kinds of
businesses restaurants and they just made me the sales manager just came in
and she told him that she had a guy that can do it and next thing I know I
meet him that way so now going to different establishments to get the
business if they said no the next day he would send somebody to the place and
say alright Larry you go back tomorrow I would go back they were so happy to sign
me up so the business was I started understanding you know of exactly what
he was but where I she was strong-arming people to do business with you yeah to
make sure they gave me the business yes isn't that was his influence and it was
going well for a while but what happened was because now I knew him personally
and he was helping me and making me successful in this first legitimate
business I started feeling guilty and paranoid I says now it's really really
bad if he finds out he's got to kill me you know I know who he is now so this
went on for months and he saw the you know I did some things that were
paranoid like when he would call me to a meeting I wouldn't go I said he's gonna
kill me tonight you know or if you want me to drop him off downtown or bring him
somewhere and I was always the one to do it but I started worry I said one of
these trips I'm not coming home you know because he's gonna find out but you
like yeah so ultimately somewhere along the way they discussed it or she told
him you know there's a lot of theories now there's people think he might have
known from the very beginning very possible some say well the other thing
you got to know is he had two other wives yes at the same time yes so he had
three he had one that was living in Vegas in Israeli beauty queen he had
Connie who was his first wife with his first children and and then he had Linda
who actually was a common law I don't think I'm pretty sure they never got
married you know what we found that out later on so he was juggling three lives
three wives and three lives so the other theory is that I made it easier for
him because his youngest wife now wasn't gonna complain when he wasn't around
she had a you know her own little toy or her own keeping her occupied right so so
anyway he confronts me with it one day we're driving to the club and he knew
because just a couple of days earlier I didn't show up somewhere and he said
it's not like you he says something's wrong so on the way he started breaking
the ice and it's just us two in the car and we would get to the club every day
about a half hour before the rest of the men showed up and on the way he's saying
things like he loves me like a son you know Linda loves you I'm gonna have this
conversation with you because I think you're very mature for your age I'm only
19 now this was about a year and a half later we had this talk and we wound up
getting out of the car walking into the club we go he sits down behind a desk I
sit at my spot on the other side of the desk like we do every day and he's going
on and finally he says I know about you and Linda so my heart's beating and I
remember always saying that I would never admit it I would never ever admit
it I says I just have to deny it but something came over me like it was do
or die it was time I mean I loved I didn't want to not be with her and my
answer to him was Greg I have a lot of respect for you you know that and I
think you are far from an idiot but only an idiot wouldn't see it what was
going on I mean he knows I'm there you know you know constantly I'm with her
all the time even when he's away you know and I didn't believe he really thought
I was helping her around the house and shopping for her you know I mean come on
after all this time so I sort of maybe deep inside I knew that he knew it's
just a weird weird time it was very rough it was tough but now the weight of
the world was off my shoulders but I did learn one of the main rules that day
he took me outside you know we would hang out on a parking meter lean on the
me to get some sun and he told me that it's okay he says I'm fine with it if
anybody outside the three of us finds out he says you and I will be killed it's
a rule somebody could kill the grim reaper well yeah we're breaking one of
the rules that is told to you today you become a made guy you know you never
turn on the family you you have to come whenever the family calls for you they
come first no drugs obviously a murder no talking to the law and no messing
around with other people's wives or girlfriends you know so I learned that
rule that day but as the years went on I also learned every one of those rules
is broken it's a facade wow everyone there were so many guys dealing drugs so
many guys dealing with the feds my boss himself was a 30 year informant you know
that's like the coup de gras the end of the story of my life to find out that he
was you know an informant for 30 years that's interesting I had a guy I had a
guy on here I think the only other guy that had on the show who was like
previous mafia was John a light yeah Johnny I know he was saying the same
thing basically yeah there's no yeah no it isn't like I said the drugs is
running rampant you know there were guys messing around with people that and it
was known it was like John Gotti was with his boss at the time Delacroche he
was with the daughter and Sammy the Bull told me that he didn't have to lie
about it he you know he says he's you know the biggest hypocrite of all of us
you know he was big into the drugs he was sleeping with his boss's daughter and
she they were both married I mean it was you know so Sammy the Bull was running
around the same time frame he was what yeah we're seeing a different he was a
Gambino family another family we're the Colombo family but I was friends with
him in the street we played ball together really racket ball was he like um
Sammy was no nonsense tough guy all the way a killer big money earner and did
you know like this guy's a killer well later on I did when I was in the life
yes this is not like you're just like hey you hang out with these guys you guys
are both of no no this is not casual conversation we used to go to the same
racket ball and weight club so and he was into boxing I was into martial arts
and then boxing also so we actually spot a few times you know but he's I like
him I like Sammy he's very witty he's a smart guy and you know he's the
survivor obviously you know to to be up against what he was up against you know
everybody wants to score people rats and things like that but I always say
there's a lot of different ways to break that rule okay some guys cop out and
admit things that are hurting the next wave of defendants that happened on my
case where guys came in they admitted there was a war they admitted they
were part of the Colombo family they don't have to prove that anymore these
guys just admitted it so that becomes evidence against you okay but they got
their reasonable deal and they were happy John Gotti talking on the tips the
way he did and being flamboyant and being in the public eye the way he was all
the time that's not a good thing you know and then other guys do it like my
boss did the smartest way of all just be partners with an FBI agent your whole
career you'll never get arrested and that's what happened with him wow yeah
he sold his own son out Greg Jr. who I'm still very friendly with he did 33
years Greg Jr. and when the father died he did a deathbed confession and he
saved other people he didn't put me or his son as part of the deathbed
confession exonerating us so this yeah yeah it's and is there stuff that he
could have said that would have exonerated you he could have said that
all I did was drive in places he was my driver he didn't know anything about the
hits it's what he did for alley boy Perceco who was the boss of the big boss
of the family Carmine Perceco's son and while I was away alley boy told me that
him and his father knew about Greg for the last 20 years so knew about him
talking to that yes I knew they yeah yeah and then I found out later on there
was an actual case from one of the attorneys on our case that I'm friends
with now wait after there was a very big tax indictment okay and about eight of
the guys heavyweights in the family were all indicted Greg was one of them so
they all show up to the first arrangement and it gets delayed you know
they always put it off for four weeks they come back to the next one they're
all there except Greg they have to delay it again a few weeks later they show up
again no Greg the fourth time they show up no Greg they throw the case out okay
so those guys junior Perceco was on that case so he had to know something but
either he felt he helped us so what's the problem right plus they knew he could
kill without having a problem they're never gonna rest so they had him doing a
lot of work over the years plus he was an enormous earner so all those things they
they gave him a pass for having a being partners with an FBI agent is that is
that a super rare valuable trait in somebody to be able to murder without
emotion oh yeah there's and the truth that it is because most of the guys that
I know aren't that way like you know even Sammy Sammy you know he told me he
says I never you know Pete they got me like I love kill I don't I hate it I
hate it he says and when I get when I have to do it he says I'm so mad at the
person for breaking the rule and forcing me to have to do this you know
it's business it's it's it's hard to realize that but and they say the human
body can get used to anything you could endure anything and eventually just
becomes a way of life you know but yeah but Greg Greg could kill you like there
wasn't a lawyer that once described him as good-looking articulate he said
something like he could sit down with judges and lawyers have dinner with you
and for dessert he'll kill you that's how he described Greg you know and we had
the tape this this this a lawyer got caught with heroin got arrested so he
immediately cooperated and they were interviewing him about all the guys from
the Colombo family that he dealt with and we had the tape so how do we get that
tape you know Greg's connection got it and this was became as we look back on
you know in time the handwriting was on the wall we just couldn't believe it no
when he was such a killer you know I'll tell you what happened during the war
which I mean really made it certain but there were things like Greg Jr. told me
that just weird things that would happen where his father wasn't part of
something the next day found out that they all got pinched you know a lot of
that but there's a lot more of that going on you know like Whitey Bulger yeah
you know I'm sure those aren't the only two you know there's yeah Whitey
Bulger yeah that's a fascinating story yeah about him oh absolutely and how they
tested those experiments on him in prison and I've you heard about all that
stuff I didn't that's all that the there's like a famous a government
program called MKUltra during the during the what's the serial killer's name
Charles Manson during his whole era his brain they were testing these mind
control CIA mind control tactics on prisoners by basically giving them
certain doses of LSD every single day wow and they were doing that to Whitey
Bulger while he was in prison and he I think he talked about it but it was like
a CIA experiment a mind control experiment wow anyways so I'm curious
about like what what kind of like human traits did you notice in a guy like this
Gregory who that makes him able to just murder somebody well you know it's the
same thing it's it's it becomes second nature he he was a he was born in the
life I mean a 15 16 years old he was already in the street stealing beating
people up doing all the things that so he's condition very very young and up
and coming guy and somebody that's already in the life sees this trait in
him sees that he's he's he's tough he's got balls he's got you know got what it
takes okay and then they groom you okay I was groomed I was taught I educated the
way of the life I don't think that's happening anymore today because I could
see the different people that are in the life now it's not the same it's
definitely not the same they missed that grooming and teaching and and having a
person become a consummate wise guy that when you walk into a place they
know who you are that you don't have to tell them this is guys somebody to
respect and Greg always had that he got straight now I think he was 18 he got
his button what does that mean when you get made into the family okay officially
inducted okay become an official member of the family to have it at that age you
had to have somebody that saw a lot about you and he loved money he loved
money so there's nothing he wouldn't do to earn money I mean every racket there
was he was in you know from Joker poker machines to the number of business
Shylocked him he was a Shylock to Shylocks what's a Shylock you lend money at
exorbitant rates so you give a guy a thousand dollars and you could charge
anywhere from he would charge me ten dollars but I would charge 30 40 or 50
per week that's the interest they have to pay that every week until they hand
you back to thousand okay so he had the he was making I mean just what I knew
about from the close guys about 25,000 a week in interest every week without fail
nobody mispayments all the people that were getting these loans from him knew
that the collateral was their life yes well they're well-being right you know
he wouldn't probably kill their legs broken right we went to work on guys
all the time that didn't pay and even that become you know second nature you
know they start you out where you're doing where somebody are beating up did
something very bad like robbed an old woman in the neighborhood okay well
found out they were selling drugs by the school we go give them a beating you
feel proud in a way you think you did the right thing you got this drug deal
away from the school or you got even with this person that robbed some of
friends grandmother you know then you participate just because a guy owes
money but you're already seasoned that they take baby steps they never ask you
to kill your friend that's like a myth like your best friend no they're not
gonna movies right the ones they're gonna ask you to kill is somebody again
early on somebody did something really bad later on it becomes looser this guy
you know had a fight with junior purse it goes nephew and junior purse goes
nephew lost the fight we have to go kill the guy I mean it's a fight yeah I got
fights growing up if I if I I would have been killed five times for winning a
fight you know I lost fights too don't get me wrong but it's just I actually got
called to a meeting that I had it I was in an after hours and we weren't supposed
to be an after hours what's the after hours okay the nightclubs closed at four
o'clock uh-huh and there's clubs that open it for oh shit yeah and they were
legal but you know they were all around so I was in one of these places and I
get a beef with I find out later on it's Paul Castellanos nephew I didn't know
and he picked a bad time because I was really at the peak of my martial arts I
was good and I won the fight okay I didn't abuse him I didn't keep hitting
him when he was down once he went down and I walked away it was over the next
night I get a call I have to go to the diner and it's like late at night almost
morning it's one of 24 hour diners you know and I'm thinking to myself why do
I gotta go see Greg at two o'clock in the morning you know it's little oh it's
Greg you had to go see well he's doing that call for me right so I get there I
see Sammy the bull hanging out outside he says hello to me I walk in who's
sitting scabby or captain Greg and Paul Castellano you're shitting so I I no I
don't know what happened yet okay Greg now comes over to me and walks me
outside well to the front door and he says what happened last night I said
what are you talking about I says I we went out you got a beef I said oh yeah I
gotta fight I says you know you know what happened once in a while he says
well that was Paul his nephew so I said I didn't know and he's telling me he
wants satisfaction wants to kill me so scabby but I learned the lesson here too
so scabby is talking on our behalf he's captain he was he was a boss for a
while very well respected and so I remember now he's Paul's talking to me he
says if it wasn't for scabby okay you'd be dead already now Greg got made so he
says if the hair is harmed on his head I said you'll find more bodies in the
street now scabby had it to Greg you know he shouldn't have said that but he's
feared Paul would have shit his pants if they had to go to water together you know
dig Paul was no Greg right he was a boss and he was a businessman so anyway long
story short I had a like I owed scabby my life now right because he saved me so
now I owed him what kind of a guy was scabby the scabby old-school old-time mob
guy that died in prison he got a 133 years and he's the guy that they quoted
the newspaper when he got the 133 years he looked at junior purse grace as well
we only got to do two-thirds and it was in the newspaper and then when he got the
time he was about 65 so obviously he was never coming home junior never came
home so anyway the funny part of this is after it's over with I walk outside I
talked to Sammy real quick and he said he while I'm walking away he says you
should have killed that cocksucker he didn't like the kid so that was funny
yeah so Sammy did Sammy kind of have your back too with same game no he was
he was there to be with the other guy he was yeah yeah yeah but we were friends
and so I says we had a rapport you know and he knew me so if this guy would have
had his way Sammy would have been the guy to kill you oh yeah that's a good
question I don't that's a good question could be could be that's a great
question I don't know that yeah I don't think Greg would have allowed me to get
in the car there and then the other thing is this
typically they won't let somebody else do it if it came down to and I'll tell
you a story where I had to be killed my own family would do it they wouldn't
allow to Gambino's to do it and there's a reason they figured I'll torture me they'll
make it real hard you want him away we'll get rid of him we had a friend of
us Tony Frezza who used to like to go out and drink and when he did coke he
got a little crazy and he liked to coke so he's in Sammy's club called tallies
and he winds up getting out of hand acting crazy whatever the owner Joey
Joey D'Angelo was his name tells him he's got to leave and he's a good
fella Tony wasn't a wise guy so he doesn't go so now a couple of the guys
bounces they physically take him out he goes home gets his gun comes back and
kills the good fella that's a mortal sin can't even raise your hands to a good
fella so he winds up scape he tells him get out of town he goes that comes down
to Florida I might have been in this area Tampa right comes down to Florida
yeah I think it was Tampa it's funny and he's trying to sort this out so he
goes to have the meeting with the Gambino family and I'll never forget this
either we know he's at the meeting and we're waiting for him to come back we
all like Tony he's one of us he's tough guys could you know we all like them he
comes walking in scape he used to walk in you bouncing his keys in his hand so
we heard him come in and he always said gentlemen he's what he did he says
gentlemen and we're all waiting he says I got good news and I got bad news he
says the bad news is Tony's got to go the good news is we get to do it how
chilling is that that was the good news but I understood they would have probably
tortured him for what he did to Joey D'Angelo so yeah it's you know and I was
on the outskirts of that one of my early hits were you there for that yeah I was
I wasn't at the actual shooting but I was there I actually picked Tony up with
Mario at the airport and drove him to where Greg Junior was waiting for him
did he know that he was about to be executed no he thought was a matter of
fact we made a stop and Mario ran in and bought Coke right so he thought we
everybody was gonna go party and I did at that time I didn't do a lot of you
know drugs or anything I drank a little bit yeah anyway and the hole was
already dug in the woods behind Gregory's house well somebody flipped
years later and told where the body was why wouldn't they just be like like if
they really like loved this guy like a brother why wouldn't you say like yo go
to the Bahamas don't come back that's what that's what I said I would have
done again it's a difference but a guy like Scappy who lives by the rules of
Cozenostra he probably couldn't live with himself he says if it was the other way
around if they hurt one of our good fellas you know we'd want the same
satisfaction so there are guys at a certain level who live this life that
know the rules and they just taking it to the grave with them you know plus I
guess you have to always be have that concern in the back of your mind if this
guy does come back then yeah then there's a war then there's a war and then
they can ask for two guys then Scappy's life could you like us you know right so
yeah and there were others I mean Bucky was a friend of ours that but not a
good fella so when I say that but he was our friend that got into the drug
business and he was supposed to he was told to stop and this is why it's
hypocritical because just five six years later we were the biggest drug
crew in Brooklyn and I'll tell you how that happened in a minute but Bucky got
killed for dabbling in the drug business and and he was one of us but
again it was a rule you're not supposed to be dealing drugs just could you guys
find a more humane way to like kill your own I mean these guys are kind of like
your friends I mean you just always shoot them or was there a better way to
do it they the only thing I ever knew was a gun yeah I never heard of guys with
knives never heard of poison the only bombing I heard of was when they tried
to bomb John Gotti and they got Frankie the Chico instead who was on the Paul
Castellano hit and it was another family the Chins family and somebody other
families never sanctioned that hit that John Gotti did on Castellano you can't
kill a boss it's a rule you just can't do it because if that starts happening
John's own consul yeah told him what you did there's a bullet waiting for you
now you broke a rule yeah and also who's gonna want to be the boss if you
could just start whacking bosses to take over you know so you don't hear about
it that much it's very rare and it's even more ready to kill a consul yeah
because a consul yeah is his position is to save lives right and like like that
night with me if they or if it was our family this was two different families
so but if it was the consul he's like the lawyer the negotiator yeah but he's
the mediator he's not he's liked and respected by all the captains and all
the good fellas okay so if he calls you to a meeting at two in the morning you'll
go and you have no you have all the confidence in the world you're not
getting killed and again that's a sacred rule of the life so if you really
believe in the life and the and he calls you you go you know that slipped over
the years to because guys in that position were shouldn't have been in the
position they were cold-blooded killers you know it's typically a position where
guy did his work made his bones over the years he's well liked he's smart he
can almost like you said that the movies make it like a lawyer like Tom Hagan and
Godfather but it's a as a matter of fact Greg told me that's the best position
in the family mm-hmm because you're untouchable and it's a lifetime assignment
they can never break you if you're a captain they could demote you mm-hmm if
you're the underboss he could demote you if you're a consul yeah it's for life
and that's the other reason it's such a trusted position you know so you know
when when that's why Samuel Bulkham beat it console yeah he'll kill too fast you
know he'll kill you before he negotiates and it was that just because of the is
that just his nature or was that his job yeah no it's probably he would kill
people who his job wasn't even kill him well he like what orders usually it was
orders from the top right and he would be the guy because they know it would get
done okay but I'm sure just like Greg and most of us we had some that weren't
put on record just emotional killing just not emotional but where you know
you even though you're not gonna get the approval you still want the guy so we
were involved in a few of those with Greg you know but I remember him telling
me I put so many on record and I've done so many hits for the family they'll
never question me if I if the guy turns up dead they're not gonna think it was
him because he's always does it by the book except those four or five times you
know right so and that was what hurt us our family would let us into a war
Carmine Cesar was a guy that I grew up with under Greg he's a little older than
me got his button first then when there was a split in the family which will get
to a little bit more vicarina asked our consul yeah Jimmy Angelina to approach
all the captains if all the captain vicarina was named acting boss by Junior
Percego when he got that 133 years with Scappy okay okay but he don't want to
step down he still wanted to be the official boss even from prison and he
has that right some people say he was wrong to do that that's a valid opinion
but the rule is if he doesn't step down himself or get voted out unanimously by
all the captains he's the boss so Vic asked Jimmy Angelina the consul yeah
who all the men trust to go and pull the captains canvassing see if they will
all vote for me to be the official boss and vote junior out the problem with
that is Junior has two sons that captains they're never gonna turn on him
Junior Percego he has lifelong friends like Scappy Greg and others that are
never gonna turn on him but there's also guys that have vendettas against Junior
Percego for whatever reasons over the years so they jumped at the opportunity
so now they were two there's a split in the family there's a Percego faction in
the arena faction and he has Jimmy go to all the captains and they don't none you
know it's not even 50-50 most of them are back in Junior I shouldn't say that
it's probably about 50-50 within two weeks Jimmy Angelina is dead and he's
a consul yeah even me at this you know this is like ten years into me being in
the life I've never heard of a console yet get hurt or anything it's coveted
like I said Vicarina gets a message to Junior Percego that junior that Jimmy
was trying to take over the family he was talking all the captains so Junior
thinks he did the right thing by you know the treachery turns out that wasn't
the case obviously because now he promotes Carmine Cesar from captain to
consul yeah Carmine and Greg Scarpa senior are close he grew up under him
was another it's like a suntan at 15 14 years old Carmine was already on record
with Greg and that's why he put him there he figured he could convince Greg to
come over but when he came to see Greg Carmine and Carmine Cesar came to see
Greg he told him that Vic wants me to talk to all the captains Greg busted
out laughing he says he's gonna do the same thing to you he's gonna have you
approach everybody and say that you're trying to take over the family just like
you did to Jimmy so oh my god so Carmine this is the treachery that goes on
behind the scenes so now Greg now Carmine goes back and he decides he's got to
kill Vicarina the boss because he can't get the captains to come over he
botches the attempt that's his first mistake he should have told Greg what
he was gonna do Vicarina would have been dead instead he wanted to go and do it
on his own and try to beat that big big shot the console yeah whatever he box he
should try to kill him they treat yeah he had two other guys with him and they
just thought I guess they weren't prepared I mean they saw you know the
details what they tried to do well they were in a car and they saw they knew
Vicks daily routine he came home just when they were supposed to but he saw
them in the car so I guess he took off so it was a how'd you let them see I'm
it's just a whole bunch of questions today you know I and they still should
have killed I mean if they really went there to do it so he saw you a big deal
right you know that's what I says they they weren't really ready for that move
I think they didn't have what it really took they would have had Greg with them
like I said Vic would have been dead right and I said if he would have been
on Vic's side I remember later on in prison Vic telling me he wishes he had
us on his side and I says well if that was the case there'd be a lot of dead
person ghosts that's what I told so so anyway that's that's how that what and
what oh just a month earlier Jimmy called for Greg okay console yet called
for him okay sent if he wanted to come to his club to talk to Greg right Greg
had just gotten out of the hospital he had like multiple operations on his
stomach he had ulcers from taking aspirins with nothing just popping
aspirins all day long he was nuts he didn't want to get a headache even if
he didn't have a headache he took him and he had me taking him with him and I
was taking him for years you know a couple of years two three then I stopped
but anyway if you want to make it if you switch those yeah the wire probably
better it'd probably be easier oh I just switch like switch the side yeah
there you got you okay oh very good yeah that won't be crossing you yeah oh
yeah perfect cool yeah I gotta keep the head good I got a couple appointments
today the aspirins what we're yeah well just not to get a headache was there
anything else you know we would go for a drink every night after the club the
aspirins in the liquor have a nice little no I think it's just so you know if
you drink too much you get a headache yeah he had the aspirins first so he
wouldn't get the headache that's that was his thinking I do that with Advil
sometimes I wonder if it's that's bad oh you know I don't know I think it's the
aspirin itself that is very acidic and cause these holes in his stomach yeah
we all they burst all at the same time anyway he almost died and he had to get
a blood transfusion this is another story that you can't make up 30 of us show
up to give him blood one match first of all he should have took the hospital
blood it was screened they knew there was no aids in it and this is right at the
height of AIDS mm-hmm one match one of our guys Paulie pumps big muscle guy he's
the match he gives him the blood it's it's tanked with AIDS so Greg winds up
with AIDS and Paulie got it from needles he was a steroids steroids from yeah they
would share him yeah you know he he I always say it because I didn't you know
again it's the way things are now it doesn't even matter but he wasn't gay I
mean he had everybody gay gay gay thing right and it was for the most part right
back then but he was he had more girls I yeah he was polished he's the first guy
that taught me how to drink wine and taught me about the final wines so Paulie
but but but but it was the vine into intervention that this is what God wanted
for Greg to go out that way or just dumb luck I don't know but he wound up with
AIDS and he had enough money that he was able to survive it because he kept
using all the trial drugs but eventually he lost so much weight and and the
dementia was kicking in and during the war he had dementia so we were out you
know hunting how old was he this time
probably it's funny to say it I I gotta say early 60s really may yeah yeah
because I met him he was about 51 52 when Linda was 32 he was like 20 years
older than her and this is 10 years later 60 61 years old okay yeah that's about
it yeah so you know it I'm 60 so it's like you know are you making me think
about I'm saying it's really I don't feel like I'm ready to go soon you look
great 60 man great shape thank you appreciate that but so he eventually
he died from that in jail yeah yeah but yeah the war was a nightmare how long
after he was in jail that he finally died probably four years he's still hung
on yeah they sent him to the hospital in Springfield I heard at the end he was
like literally I want to say like 50 pounds just just really you know just
started eat them up but now was he was like in the beginning when he was trying
to groom you and like he told you he was treating you and bringing you up as his
own son right was his objective to make you turn you into a trained killer no he
was turning me into again the the only way I could describe it is the consummate
wise guy he wanted all of his guys when you walked into a place they know you're
a good fella and not because you're banging the place up or getting fights
just the way you carry yourself and the way you talk to others the way you
dress you know the way you tip you know there's a whole bunch of things and he
taught me every one of those he never walked into a restaurant where he didn't
give the matron day a 10 and then again this is back 30 years maybe we give him
20 now you know I still do that you know a person that took me to to the to the
table at Burns I tipped her I just it's just you know she's walked me to the
table and she was shocked but so no so you had to be and you had to be able to
kill and hurt people when they had to be hurt you know so yeah it is a grooming
and and and I I tell you baby steps the first hit that I was even privy to in
any way shape or form I was asked to give a guy a flat tire okay he gave me the
ice pick and that morning very early in the morning I went I gave the guy a flat
I didn't think none of it I thought it was I is silly I thought he parked in
his place or or in his driveway or did something disrespectful and he just
wanted to give the guy a flat the next day in a newspaper man killed fixing
flat tire so he's was shot and I didn't say anything to Greg about it I read it
I knew it I knew it was the car I gave the flat to but I think it was my first
little test you don't have to wear those you sure yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it
that was my first test where he if I would have came in like panicky or Greg
it's at the same car like nervous but I knew better and I was probably only 20
but I was already around these guys they treat me like an equal I go
everywhere with Greg he's bringing me to meet other bosses other captains so I
can't I just know okay few months later he asked me to go buy a shovel I buy the
shovel a couple of a year goes by six months it's not like we're killing
every day is somebody's got to go and it's Tony Frezza so me and Gregory have
to go buy shovels and dig a hole okay that's what I said the hole was already
dug okay we at the first Murray you witnessed yeah yeah that's that would be
the first one that I was really really privy that I actually brought him to his
demise you know but the later on the first one that I I was a crash car now
and I was right on the scene and I saw the guy getting popped and they jump in
the car and drive away so that's what I'm saying yeah I asked you to pull the trigger
for quite a while till you're you've been around enough of them that you you're
kind of desensitized to it by the time yeah yeah you know it's hard to use
words that's a great word to use it's sad to say you know but that's a good
word you do get desensitized that's a great word to put it because I fumble
over that to say how it's possible right you know especially growing up the way I
did from it from a normal family one of the cops on my case Tommy Day's a
dear friend to this day said in an interview you know one of those
interviews among cops where they're trying to figure out you know the mind of
a killer or whatever you want to call it and he said he uses me says it for
sweetheart like Larry Mazza could do it anybody can do it so you know it's how
you brought up and they and here's the other thing you got to realize we're
recruited at a very young age where you're maybe easily misled or you like
the cause you you you gravitate you like the Cadillacs you like all the money
and you don't really know the bad side of it so you're recruited at 15 16 17 I
was 17 the guys that we're gonna meet that were coming into the club my point
is all these years later they can't recruit me they can't nobody could
recruit me to do something like that I know better I mean I you know I I learned
the hard way in some ways but I would never you know I wouldn't I want I know
the hit man thing is another myth I'm not a hit man you know the newspaper one
day put an article out hit man to testify against GI would they call him a
G a G-man G-man hit man to testify against G-man because I wound up that
was my saving grace at the end I mean I I made a deal with the government but
basically it was about the corruption because all their cases were gonna get
blown out of the water you know so whose case is we're gonna get blown out of
the well all the cake all the guys that were gonna be going to trial it came out
now that Greg my boss was an informant for 30 years so they we didn't know who
it was who he was getting information from we thought it was either a cop or
somebody on the other side during the war which I'll explain to you further so
we knew there was somebody but now he admits when they fast forward while he's
away that he was work that he was a government informant so he wanted
leniency even at the very end he wanted leniency after all the murders we did
during the war you know and the judge is now can't do it not this time any
sentence of 10 years which was life for him anyway but wait I went off track
there so so if he was protected by the feds that's that's why they would that's
why the trials would get blown not only that this agent was giving us addresses
of our enemies so you're giving me he gave us a very agent he gave us an
address so these are all the things and I'll get to them are the the last
casualty at a war why not really last one last one that we did then when I was
away there were a couple more well when we all got arrested just sort of cleaning
up the mess so did this agent get in trouble is that how Greg him and Greg
were together for many many years like he was working for the feds for 30 years
it goes all the way back to the Mississippi burning story ever see that
movie no I've heard about I'm familiar with it what's this what is this can tell
from people who haven't heard it yeah it's about these three civil service
workers that they're fighting for to abolish the the racial right tensions
and all of that but the Ku Klux Klan in Mississippi was still very strong and
they killed these civil service workers one was black and I think two were white
and they buried the bodies the FBI couldn't get anybody to talk none of the
Klan's guys would talk so they recruited Greg Scop they brought him to
Mississippi and it's you could see it in the New York Times this is very public
now he went and the words that were told to me later on because sometimes the
FBI says more than they should was that he did unspeakable things yeah so you
know that leaves you a little imagination and then later on I heard he
had a knife to their you know the groin area cut their dicks off it's you know
yeah you know I wasn't there but you know these are things that you piece
together yourself unspeakable things yeah I don't speak well if you're talking
about KKK no okay you cut his balls dick off sorry we can smile about it that's
true so anyway he gets it finally gets to the guy that knows where the bodies
were buried it's like only one guy really knew okay and what it was the
second in command or whatever and so since that day I used the term cop
lunch he had cop lunch with to do whatever he wanted in the street he was
never gonna get arrested and he took advantage of that to you know I mean
making a money-making machine and a killer he's making a good he must have
been getting paid quite a bit to be oh he was getting paid to yeah yeah that came
out later on in the trial the FBI agent I won't mention his name because he did
beat the case the reason he beat the case oh really was yeah Greg's the Linda
the his last wife the one that I was with for ten years just about had
conflicting stories earlier on and this is my deduction she was still on the
payroll to keep her quiet because she knew a lot about this agent okay and once
they stopped paying her I think she got scorned okay because now she had no
money she was not living well Greg is is dead so she comes clean and admits
what she knew about him so the things that I knew okay during the war he would
get we had this big I don't know if you're too young to remember these big
shoe phones these big the stock brokers used to do yeah yeah you know now
everybody has a little cell phone we didn't have phones back then so he would
call somebody or the person would call on that phone and he would refer to the
person as his girlfriend it's my girlfriend meaning his connection
whoever it was we didn't know we thought it was a cop based on somebody
information then we thought it could be somebody on the other side he says some
day I'll tell you he says but he didn't tell us me and Jimmy my partner would
only three guys were together every day during the war nobody else could come
near us anymore because we knew somebody would give us up our own friends now to
get this over with would kill us right so we would we won the three of us were
one and he was I talking about what I might lose my train of thought the big
shoe phone calling his girlfriend yes so that so we had I had phone records
later on the feds got these phone records so they know exactly who he was
talking to okay we had a scanner which had a secret code like a five or six
digit any five or six numbers random seven two one six five four three we had
that code so we were listening to the FBI and local task force police as they
were following us and our enemies we knew when they were behind us we knew
where they were going so how do we get this then it came a little later on we
were getting this information that had to be from surveillance like it came back
like we knew exactly what time this guy leaves his house 340 in the morning
because he goes to a school bus company at he owns okay we get there at 320 340
the lights at a cock turn on somebody was doing surveillance so that
information later on we know came from him right we also had access to FBI
badges and credentials because he's there was one guy he wanted to go and
call him out of the house is the FBI and get him in the car and once he gets put
in the car Greg was gonna be sitting in the car I mean picture that scene now
that guy would have felt no he's in coughs and he's sitting between me and
Greg you know because the guy knew us his actually was wild Bill Billy
Catolla and he knew me so I couldn't go to the door but there are a few guys
that he didn't know that were dressed in cheaper suits than we usually wear and
go up to the door and show the credentials and call him out and tell
him we're not gonna coffee in the house you know sometimes the FBI would do that
just will cuff you outside you know if they want to be nice not to do it put
them in front of the family you know because they know we're not typically
gonna shoot it out with them all right so anyway we had this whole plan so all
these different things led to FBI okay later on two of the agents themselves
well was sitting in the office with this agent and they have an episode on the
Sopranos about this when the biggest hit of the war happened Nikki Black Nikki
Grancio who was Vic's choice for counsel yeah okay when we got him he banged
the desk the agent and he says we're gonna win this thing we're gonna win
this thing the other agents says we like and then they started putting pieces
together too we had this is what would made them know there's one agent
underneath this was a supervising agent who's bad the underneath the agent
names Chris does not only give his last name gets an address from surveillance
of where vicarina's hiding out that's our number one target if we kill Vic the
was over okay he Greg gets this address okay we go there there's no house on the
lot it's a wrong address so the only person Chris gave that wrong address to
was his superior how does Greg wind up with the same exact wrong address so now
they knew they saw they followed Greg there something well no just he only
Chris didn't give it to Greg okay this address he gave the address from
surveillance this is with to his superior so that's the only right so
he's wondering how Greg got that address you know and this all came out in the
trial later on you know that's how you know how did Greg initially get like if
he had that protection how did that protection dissolve because the other
agents found out that yes was dirty well well no Chris wasn't his superior
yes and you won't give partially that partially that we don't know and well you
know it's alleged his name's Lynn okay you know I see I'd like to come on in
because he beat he beat the case okay so he isn't he doesn't speak about it
publicly he does he does he wrote a book you can read the book it's called deal
with the devil deal with the devil yeah yeah and he's done documentaries oh
he's out there I mean yeah just just you can research and find his name
interest his first name's Lynn and so the way it all ended was Greg at the at
the end of the war okay his dementia was set in and he wasn't making good
decisions his son Joe Joey who's my godson I stood up for him in
confirmation winds up getting into drug business okay and I'll backpedal that a
little bit and tell you how we all how the club went downhill but Joey was now
in the drug business and I guess there was a corner that he claimed was his
and somebody else was selling there so he went with a baseball bat the guy
pulls out a gun so he leaves he comes back to the house he tells his father
his father calls me I was home takes me five minutes eight minutes to get there
depending on lights you know in Brooklyn I drive to the house and he tells me
what happened so I said all right I know the kid Mike I go talk to him I know
who he's talking about we go to the corner he's not there anymore he probably
knew something was coming but before we go Joey has a gun I took the gun from
I put in the glove compartment and I locked it I swear not going to kill the
kid okay your father asked me to talk to him straightness out this kid was
now becoming a little nutty you want to be like like his father you know yeah
he's got that calm misled to be right be the grim reaper so we go looking 15 20
minutes he's not around I said let's let's go home I go back I tell Greg I
says I think it's best anyway I said let everybody cool down we'll find them
tomorrow cool the heads he agreed with me he says yeah that I think you're
right I go home I'm not home one minute I don't have my clothes on getting
ready to get on and the phone rings and it's Linda screaming on the phone
panicking like like a lunatic she thinks Joey got killed Greg shot she just
mom so I'll be right there she's telling me she needs me come over come over
please I get in the car I drive back on the way I pass the block where this kid
lives there's unmarked cars there's police cars ambulances fire department I
mean it's a crime scene I go around the long way go to the house I get to the
house the car that I was in his bullet holes all over it Joey's friend who was
who was in the car with me also with Joe he was sitting in the back Joey was
sitting next to me is in the backseat gasping trying to get a breath of life
every once in a while he's dying I go upstairs into the house Greg is on the
phone he has a scotch in front of him he's got a towel he got his eye shot out
okay and he's telling the parole people because we were already here he was
arrested and was given bail which is the biggest the biggest force in the
history of mankind because no mob guys get bail nobody they gave him bail and
he had the bracelet on so they were calling this is the your alarm went off
you were further than 50 feet from your house and he's denying it it's not I
never left I've been here the whole time now I got to bring him to the hospital
okay what do you mean when you say he had his eye shot out oh he went there
with Joey Joey was probably still breaking his chops we got to get this
guy we can't let him do this he pulled a gun on me and probably I knew he used to
get under his father's skin so right you want to kill him let's go fucking do it
you know just like that just let's go so he goes they were waiting they were in
front of the house and there's about eight guys soon as Greg gets out he
starts shooting they were shot they opened up a shot this kids in the back
seat he gets hit in the head Joey runs he runs in the drive where I heard a kid
hit him in a garbage pail or something so he wound up surviving and the father
gets his eye shot out so I got to bring him to the hospital there's four or five
hospitals in Brooklyn that I could bring him to he insists on going to the
hospital that saved him Mount Sinai in Manhattan so I got to go through toll
boots with cops it's the days when the cops man them at the tunnels I got a
drive through Manhattan with this guy dying in the car and I do it I'm so I
was loyal to a fault back there are the kids still in the backseat no no no we
took him I took him in my car Greg big Greg he's got a guy he's gonna die he's
gonna bleed to death right so I walk into the hospital with him and the nurse
comes and she says oh my god what happened I said he fell in the odd I
think a pipe went his eye so she wheels him in the they wheel him in the back
I put him on the gurney they wheel him in the room she gives me paperwork to fill
out she comes back out she says you stay right here I know she saw a bullet so
when she walks away I go to the door I open it I says Greg I got to go he's
laying there like this he goes like this to me thumbs up that's the last time
I've seen him in the free world really yeah that was the last year because now
they locked him up and they he couldn't get bailed again and they had to leave
him in Rikers Island for a while which is a jungle but they had the best AIDS
unit because of all the junkies in there and a few months later I got arrested
you know they just rounded everybody up from the war they had guys talking four
five guys flipped Carmine Sessa our counsel yeah the first one to flip and
call a big meeting and at that meeting everybody got arrested except him so I
mean that says the treachery in the backstab and is there's no there's no
parameters it's just it's mind-boggling how the fuck did he survive getting shot
in the eye with AIDS and everything yep yeah and then the bullet like what well
here's what happened here's what they said it didn't go in this way okay it
must have deflected off the car and went in this way so it didn't penetrate deep
into the brain okay right yeah so yeah exactly exactly so but he was running
out of his nine lives you know the AIDS was gonna eventually now being in
prison he was certainly not gonna you know survive you don't get good medical
attention in there yeah and how much time did you actually end up doing in
prison ten years I got a ten-year sense what was your whole trial what was your
whole thing well I didn't go to trial I was offered the deal to tell them what I
knew basically about the corruption okay I walked out three times because they
wouldn't let my partner Jimmy come in under the same umbrella as me they
wanted to catch him you know make pub he was on the limb Jimmy was on the limb I
was in I got arrested in Florida and Cocoa Beach as a matter of fact oh I came
down for a vacation after the war if you let me just get out of one this way
they don't see me around and Jimmy and I had plans he was gonna come down and meet
me and we were gonna drive off and go somewhere okay you know we set up our
pipelines and just to stay stay out of their faces time would have helped time
would have helped because our boss always I confuse you with our boss all
the time this Joe T was our acting boss on our side the person goes and he went
on the limb they called him I think five six years later okay and they made a
deal with him like that for five years he's the boss okay because his new
prosecutors they have their own cases they don't want this one thrown up now
so they just so if I if we would have went on the limb we would have probably
got that same five-year seven-year deal you know but ultimately they says okay
because they couldn't find them they came back and it's all right we'll keep
the door open for Jimmy but and I couldn't admit knowing where he was so I
says I'll see if I can get a message to him and you know I'll try to break find
my family somebody couldn't you know I have no idea where he is you know right
I really didn't but I knew how to contact him right we had that you know so he
he was able to come in and you know I had a cop out to zero to life so if I
would have lied or I would have gotten or if they would have found out that I
didn't come clean on things that I did I could have been charged or I could have
got life ultimately he gave me 10 years the judge and you know the guys that I
call mine got three years Sammy got five years so the guys I really give them a
lot we'll get in the door immediately you know but they didn't really like me
because it was the corruption it wasn't you know not that they didn't like me
personally but the case that I brought them was basically their own right you
know so they weren't gonna fight tooth and nail you give this reformed guy give
him a second chance you know they did what they had to do they said he he lived
up to his obligation how much time did Lynn get that he didn't do anything no
he beat it yeah like I said he walked out so but the judge it was a New York
Supreme Court I want to leave a stain on the agency exactly the judge said in
his his closing argument or closing whatever that wreck it is I read it said
even though you're walking out at his courtroom I'm not convinced you're
innocent and he was the jury it was he was the judge in the jury he waved the
jury child okay and he ripped into him he ripped into the FBI for how they allowed
this monster that's what he called him to survive all these years in a
partnership with you guys so he ripped them an old to put it that way and he
was the best judge out of all the judges I was around I mean I had one our first
judge what's the word recluse himself or recused himself he stepped down he
told us he says you can't get a fair trial with me I think you're all guilty
he said and I feel like an honor I remember the Colombo family that I've
heard so many of your cases he says you can't get a fair trial so he left we get
this other guy sifting who was the most miserable human being on earth even other
judges hate him they just was a hated man and I wound up with him and the same
judge earlier on at the very very beginning when I first met Linda I was
on the fire department test I took the test I got a 99 and I got a 95 on the
physical I was gonna be called within within a year to the academy this same
judge because the at the time minorities and women claimed the test was too
tough it wasn't fair so it took him two years to rule on it and then another two
years to set the next date so four years went by I'm not blaming him but it just
shows you how some things happen in life I would have taken the fire department I
was still early on I didn't know Greg it wasn't a year and a half in two years
into my relationship with him like it now he knew and he was bringing me along
and he's a he's the same judge I had a sense me wow how wild is that it's
amazing it's amazing so but this judge going back to judge it's something like
Reebok or Reichbach R E R I C H B A C H Reichbach but research him if you he's
right yeah he's a really he still is he still died no he died but this guy you
know how they always wear black robes yeah he didn't he wore a John Gotti
suit really had his hair impeccable but he was a smart smart guy and he would
ask me questions like while I'm sitting in the in the you know even though the
lawyers are asking questions he said I want to ask a question and he asked me
a question and very bro just brilliant and and and it was very very polite to
me you know like the other judges the Fed judges your your piece of garbage to
them you're nothing but meat that they're gonna put away for life they're
all the same team this guy was very fair and that's why when it had to get
thrown out it got thrown out but he told him you're not innocent my eyes
wow yeah so but he was able to you know obviously maintain his pension and
everything else so he would have lost all of that what kind of a prison were
you in was it like it was like a federal maximum security it was maximum
security and then as time went on I wound up in a medium okay a medium at the
very very pretty violent yeah yeah yeah but they are but you could avoid that
it's not like you know again like you see TV there are prisons like that but
it's just gangs and they're always you know that's their life you know but most
federal prisons are not that way if you don't if you're not into the state
penitentiaries or gay stuff you know you'll you'll avoid the fights they'll
actually fight over a guy if you don't gamble which I did every single day but
I made sure everybody had put the cash up you know stamps was cash in prison yeah
want a better football game cash has to be put up that was my main business
book making and I booked every day that I was away I supported myself that really
yeah yeah I'll tell you this is a funny story I said it a thousand times you're
allowed three books of stamps everybody's equal you can't have more than three
books of stamps because you can use that for currency in there stamps in what
time period like at any one time like if they come and shake my room down myself
you only have three in possession right if they see ten books they're gonna write
me up okay maybe I go to the hole maybe I get extra duty or whatever when I got
released I had 2,000 books oh my god what I left I left them in there with
different guys I gave one guy 500 one guy you know so it made their time because
you use them for I pay a guy book of stamps to clean my room once a week pay
another guy a book of stamps to bring me good food out of the like broccoli and
hard-boiled eggs I don't want to eat the garbage so you know it's you can live a
little better right if you you know if you want to if you if you got that mine
that's was always my I'm gonna put these ten years back on at the end were you
still in contact with any of these mob guys when you were inside um no it's
because everything's monitored the phone calls you know you can't really call
right but didn't you say some of the guy like one of the original bosses was
still the boss after he got locked up yes how do you do visits he would do on
visits he would have you know Chuck he was a captain that was his nephew that
would go visit him his son would go visit so he would bring and they put
him only in California Lampak and he still would get messages and that was
also a problem during the war because his brother Teddy was not very smart he
was a respectfully he was a simple-minded guy okay he was intrude he
wasn't street smart but he was going cuz he's a brother he can go deliver
messages and he wasn't bringing the right messages back ultimately we found
out he was soft-coated because Vic made him a captain so he sort of liked Vic
and if and I remember Junior saying how do you make him a captain his own
brother how do you make you know but he did it with the Machiavelli tactic you
know by bringing one of the brothers as a captain you know he's showing good
faith right you know but he was bringing like like Greg would say you bring this
message to Junior tell him that we are not gonna stop shooting until they the
first word out of the mouth that the meeting has to be you are recognized as
the boss Teddy would come back and say nah he wants you to keep talking he wants
peace he wants peace he wants to keep talking it out and Greg told me there's
no way Junior said that there's no fucking way Junior say he's his message
would be take that cock sucker out right one person he had an answer to in the
whole wide world Vicarina and he wasn't happy that's that's the greed that's
that that ego yeah I want I want this position officially you did have it you
were an official acting boss so all you had to do is run the ship and split it
with Junior mm-hmm you know I think he was worried he was gonna be knocked down
when calm my son junior purse girl son came home and I don't think that was
gonna happen I don't think that was the case of my personal and I had
conversations with Ali about it I remember saying if he would have behaved
he could have kept the position he says I come out I take that position I'm back
in I'm back in the can in six months you know so not immediately anyway maybe
ultimately he would have wanted the position but he was a cousin he was
Junior's cousin so he should have been more loyal but Greg said he was he was
he wasn't a powerful tough guy he was very big earner big money and Junior
thought he could control him and never lose the power but the problem was other
people controlled him too right Greg had said if he put a guy like himself if
you put a guy like me not me be Greg telling me this or Joe T named four or
five guys they would never try to take the family from Junior you know and they
anybody comes to tell them to do it they're gonna tell them talk like that
once more you dead right you know you're done right I don't want to hear that you
know Vic didn't do it he listened and then John Gotti was integral major
problem for us because he wanted Vic to win the reason is Vicks on the boss Joe
Scopo grew up with Johnny John Gotti and John all the egos put together his was
still bigger he wanted to be the boss of all bosses there there isn't anymore
that you know there's equals that the Commission they're all equal but he
wanted to have the strongest vote on the Commission so if Vic wins the war this
came out later it's a fact they were gonna kill Vic themselves and let Joe
Scopo become the boss so him and John would it have two votes on the Commission
wow man yeah it's ruthless that's unbelievable it's unbelievable what is it
like is there any thing left over in this kind of mob gang world today I'm
gonna tell you what Nick Pallegi said in one of the write-ups for our ultimate
TV series what's left is a few scattered guys
going after the roadkill well picking up the road I can't I forgot the exact
words but that there's just a few guys left as Vulture taking me off the bones
exactly pick it yet there's nothing left you know because the guys that I grew up
under that I saw and I had to answer to were seasoned old-school guys that you
may see in some movies okay now they scraped the bottom of the barrel they
don't dress the same they don't act the same they don't have the same ethics you
know they wear hoodies like street gangs I mean you know it's a different culture
for sure it is it is and the families are totally weakened I think it must be
harder to kill people nowadays I would think oh it is I think you know what I
had always said that was our downfall I said if I ever started something I would
say no killing beat the guy up until he leaves on his own just keep beating him
up every time you see him give him a beat eventually he's gonna leave right it's
just as good as yeah and we don't have to face life I believe and Sammy told me
just recently and he might have heard it somewhere too there's a no kill edict if
that's the right word edict is like a law right yeah yeah I think that's the
exact words he used there's a no kill so there hasn't been you haven't read I
mean he used to read you know almost a few a month a few a month you know did
you see a body somebody got killed somebody's missing now you don't I mean
the last one that I remember reading about was a famous pizza place okay that
was somewhat mob owned yeah I say that because I think there was partners there's
a mob guy in the guy that knows the recipes yeah exact they split up there
was a problem okay and one of the guys tried to take the recipe and they killed
him he was killed in front of his house had something to do with the recipe the
pizza recipe Ellen's Pomona he got it's that's a great yeah it's still a great
pizza if you ever go to Brooklyn go to L&B L&B Spamoni got it and there's
Pomoni ice is phenomenal too but I got a book for you so I'm gonna give you the
book okay I wish you I wish you would have read it first yeah because you a
lot of these things I'm telling you you'd sort of what are known about it
right like the restaurants and stuff in New York are just to die for but not
right now I mean yeah I wouldn't go to New York if everyone I know everyone I
know that was born and raised in the Brooklyn Queens area they they never
want to go to New York like I would rather no especially now with the
politics it's it's it's terrible it's it's horrible I mean it's dangerous it's
more dangerous than we would it and some people want us back they say really more
dangerous when you guys were in the street none of this shootouts and you
know the nonsense that you see in now just the the rioting and looting and
stuff they couldn't when Al shopped and marched through our neighborhood okay the
cops knew it they were happy we have more mob guys there from the five
families lining up the street they weren't allowed on the sidewalk they had
a walk they could do that much we didn't care but they were not gonna come
near our stores or our houses okay so we lined the street where they were
walking until one knucklehead and I and I know the kid too I knew his brother
well runs in there and stabs Al Sharpton he had stabbed the guy arrested he did
time for it yeah right in front of his cops all around all the mob guys are
there and he just runs in the middle of the parade and steps out shop yeah yeah
that's insane needless to say he's not a good fella never made it there how did
you end up getting in touch with Robert De Niro well the cops that were on my
case I told you became their security guys yeah and he was looking for somebody
from the old from the life that can give him some tips on playing like a
Frank Sharon type of guy a mob guy hit man or whatever and they all said me and
you know it and it's funny too I I've said this a few times it's it's a
double-edged sword they all said me so I'm gonna tell you how to kill a guy how
to get rid of weapons how to bury a body I mean that's what you would think but he
also wanted to get the the verbiage the words the the how and in situations how
would this happen how would a guy knowing he's in trouble not run not just
run when you reach into your pocket you know things like that so because there's
a scene there where he's got a killer guy and the guy knows he's in trouble so
I so I told him how Greg did it Greg used to have a handkerchief and he would
sneeze or cough and he reached it go to his pocket and the guy would see the
handkerchief come out and he'd actually be relieved so he wiped his nose when he
put the hanky back in he comes out with the gun so that was a little trick of
his yeah so yeah I told him how we got rid of weapons and all of that's in the
movie I mean so probably a dozen things that I sat and talked to him about so
what was it like a one-time meeting no I was with him probably three or four
times where you guys meet like would you I met it is his he has a hotel in
Greenwich Village yeah and his office is right there okay so the first time I
spent about three hours with him and he was just listening to me and I kept
saying mr. D you want to say something I mean you know so no no keep going keep
going he's just listening and getting words and hearing about hits and from my
book then the next time he gave one of the cops a list of things and I got on
the phone with him then another time we went back and we sat in his living room
we went to Scorsese's house one time and really yeah yep and he had he wanted
me to meet Martin Scorsese and he had two casting directors there who were
also listening to me so they were all for using it for their own casting
reasons you know and ultimately I was gonna get a part I didn't know what and
I'm gonna beat a small part where I killed Albert Anastasia in the barber
seat which was a famous or infamous hit in New York back in the 50s so it was
it was incredible experience and then probably a month or so later I'm in
Nick Palleggi's house and Nick Palleggi wrote Goodfellas Casino part of
American Gangster yeah he's he's the three of them you know my wife was
with me throughout the whole thing we said we are sitting with cinematic
royalty that's what it is the Nero Scorsese and Palleggi it was amazing
kidding me and and then I met him twice after as a matter of fact the last day I
got a picture I could show you the last day of filming he invited us in to watch
the last scene it was him he was filming just you know a small scene just if
when you see the movie you'll see that he has to put a lock on on a truck and
there's significance to that but it was funny he made it he tied a knot two
different ways and Scorsese caught it he says Bob earlier on you tied a
different knot so he had to tie it the same exact way so then everyone went like
this to him but that's right I mean and he went back and he had to do the scene
again you know and yeah that's crazy you think about all like the little
continuity details like that when you're making a movie yeah everything else
because in case you got to watch him film my scenes he's true to camera he
still uses the old-fashioned cameras a lot of guys use these new things handhelds
and stuff he uses the old big one that rolls cameras yeah the old just yeah
and she was able to look through it and watch exactly what he saw so they would
cut and we did my scene when you see it it's really short but it's probably 20
seconds we filmed the 40 times really once he got a walk too much of a brick
wall and he said people aren't coming to the movies to see a brick wall he always
got it's always then another time one of the girls walking by me smiled and he
says what are you smiling about what do you think you're in a movie she was
walking a baby so she couldn't smile and then you know big Bob one of the cops
that actually wrote the forward for my book the only part of the book I didn't
write because I had a right about myself you know the photo right he's the
bouncer the bodyguard okay so big guy he's probably told us this it comes
walking through they want them to look menacing so a bunch of times he came
through and he would give me the eye and that makes people think he was in on
it because nobody knows for sure if the bodyguard was in on it or he wasn't so
him looking at me you know gissing then we walk up the steps and then I play I
had another part in a TV series called the perfect murder and I played a
corrupt ex cop working for the mob so and the mob guy I was working for was
Joe Pesci's character in Casino Tony Spolatro yeah yeah and as funny too we
have on our desk a possible story about more about this this guy because he
worked the bar I was I was behind the bar in the scene and I also popped out of
the backseat with the gun you ever see that it's in every show somebody comes
out of the backseat yeah I was the guy but in the scene in the in the bar was
this this guy and now it's called a crazy horse too it's a cabaret in Vegas
but it's was a violent I mean the bounces in there were killing people
burying them in the desert if they weren't paying bills they were beating
them I mean it was bad there was drugs it's almost like a studio 54 type of
movie but we have you know we have somebody that wants us to see if we could
get our producer to do that my wife's the manager now she does she she does all
the managing for all the all the people we bring in and we've got several we got
several have a show starting they're gonna start filming it in June it's all
about paranormal and Bigfoot and stuff like that but it's mob related because
it's an ex mobster that really really believes in this stuff and he goes
tracking them down tracking Bigfoot's yeah and paranormal stuff but they have
all the equipment and they they say that you know we we're using our skills from
tracking people in the street that we had to go FDS oh my god but it's it's
gonna be I think it's gonna be light-hearted but it's real but it's
gonna there's gonna be humor I mean there's no way yeah it's gonna be because
these are ex-mob guys and they're talking like mob guys you know and he tells
a scene he tells one of them who's a martial arts guy he says we run into
Bigfoot you're gonna have to use all your moves on that serious you know but I
laugh too like you just did it or like if you see it goes you have to pull your
gun on them shoot them well they have stuff they're gonna have rabbis and
priests in case they run into an exorcism situation so but we have like a
little portfolio you know that's awesome you know anyway yeah so was it like
going into Martin Scorsese's house what and where was his house okay it's near
Central Park in Manhattan very exclusive house it's a four-story
brownstone those are very very rich houses yeah very very what do you mean
but what does that mean it's a it's a type of house it's there they're all
built together side-by-side is it like on the ground level there's a ground level
okay then there's four stories but each one you is your house it's they're huge
so we go in a but low opens the door is it kind of like what I don't know if you
ever seen the pictures of Jeffrey Epstein's house in New York probably what's
like between these big buildings and you just go it looks like a cathedral yeah
you know this notice I know what you're talking about it's more how would you
describe it Cal can you find it on Google yeah you could yeah you can you find
a picture of a brownstone house in New York yeah so anyway his was white yeah
and it's four stories we walk in I don't know I'm going to his house I'm I know
meeting him but I'm assuming we were gonna go to restaurant or studio or
something so he brings us upstairs the butler to like the third floor and it's
one huge living room okay there was another room the other way it might have
been a bedroom where but so we're sitting down all of a sudden I I just
start walking around and she's Kelly's telling me sit down you can't be walking
around we don't know where you're at you're just looking around so I go I see
the Oscars he has it no way looking at the Oscars this is Marty's house
Montesquieu Stacey's house so I turn around who's standing in the door the
narrow so he comes over he says hello sits down then Marty comes down with the
two girls and it was it was it was amazing we were talking and it was you
know a couple times like I cursed and I apologized because I don't like to curse
I don't try you know anyway it's another story but and I would say I'm sorry
excuse me one of the okay yeah yeah yeah those are all over New York yeah and
they are like less than half of the distance yeah exactly so you see the
red one in the middle there that one yeah but it was it was like that but a white
one it was a white one okay okay you might have zeroed in on his house who
knows it like it just blends in with the rest of the houses you can't even tell
it's exactly but inside they're incredible and you know they're very
expensive I mean right expensive Nick Palleggi and those do it has those like
stairways that just go right to the sidewalk yes everything there's a
basement there's a floor level also okay yeah so it's a it's a style from back
then but yeah those are cool Nick Nick when we went to see Nick Palleggi he
had the we went on the second floor and there's nothing but books when he came
in he came from upstairs down he says my wife made me buy this unit also for my
books he lives in the penthouse and that downstairs was sort of his office is
reading his library yeah amazing but he had a big spread of food out for us and
never forget it he says my mother would never forgive me if I didn't put out
food for guests had it been so sorry that was amazing he's he's a very nice
guy yeah very nice I could I call him he always answers back who's Corsese no
oh Nick Palleggi you know at the beginning I was in contact a lot with
denaro but he wound up with personal issues would go into divorce and I
think other thing now with the pandemic he's got businesses all over New York
they got to be getting killed his restaurants his hotels so he's sort of
just been I think he's in seclusion almost you know
Scorsese I haven't talked to again but you know he when we were leaving he made
us come back in because his wife wanted to meet us so we went back in and we
met her and then at the final day of filming she was there and she has I
believe Parkinson's I think that's what it is so she's having a little trouble
but she remembered us all these months later she's very you know so he's a
nice guy he was very personable like denaro's quiet yeah shy yeah Scorsese
he talks he laughs about you know he's outgoing you know they're almost
opposites that's so funny man yeah yeah and the other thing I learned is that
these casting directors you don't have to be the greatest actor okay because if
you see if you start watching a lot of denaro's movies his idiosyncrasies are
always there he you know most of his movies the way he laughs the way he look
at you you know so when they're casting somebody they're looking for certain
things you know like not that he's not a great actor I mean because he's done
things like I saw out of character like the dear hunter in Cape Fear those were
fabulous I'm a fantastic the gangster movies to me you know he's got like some
fascination with gangster mob stuff yeah well it's it's a bit of huge money
maker it's a huge money maker so you know but you know and then there's guys
that can you know go back on stage and play Hamlet you know right you know but
those you know those are but anyway I've noticed that that's why you see a lot of
the same guys in the same movies not because they're great I just because
they almost don't have to act like in the Sopranos yeah it's almost like he's got
like that brand built around himself or it's like you know you just want this
guy in your movie because it makes it marketable you know right oh yeah no
definitely no he's a brand without a doubt you know he's in a movie is gonna
sell so well he still may be in mind and let me the name of the book I'm gonna
bring it to I wish I had here to show you yeah to show the fans too it's it's
called tell people where they can find it and and where they can download it
whatever it's called a life there is a Kindle version the difference is you
don't get the pictures and I have some really nice pictures in there all the
people I've met include in the narrow Pileggi Mike Madsen Armando Sante who
wrote it testimonial that's just was phenomenal and he's a great guy Armando
Sante he's the one that played John Gotti the original and he also John
Travolta now he wasn't good for that part and I like John Travolta but not for
that part yeah so yeah you could get it on there okay or you can go to my
website it's www.larrymaza-thelife.com yeah and there I sign every book that
goes out I some mornings I spend hours signing them like probably after your
show I'll get a bunch I hope and so I sign everyone and like I said the
pictures it's worth getting the book for the pictures right they do those
pictures you could put a face to every name I said today like Junior Percego
you know and then Carmine Cessa when you're looking see them and I think
they're important I think they're important yeah absolutely yeah yeah yeah
yeah and you get a picture of Greg Grim Reaper and when you see the picture of
him you're gonna say if in the on the mobster in the dictionary is his picture
oh really yeah he dressed that way you know the fancy watch and he was a guy
who did the 666 like he would carve 666 when no no no no that that's that's a
myth what happened was we all had beepers back then we didn't have cell
phones so we would have a code like say the guys from 13th Avenue which is our
Avenue we're gonna beep us it would be 013 so we knew who was beeping us then the
next thing would be a number of where to meet and we had like 12 different
numbers one was Nathan's one was L&B one was you know a McDonald's somewhere one
was a diner yeah all over the city he actually tried you know Jersey so so we
knew this was the part and if it was 11 it was the person goes he took the code
666 so they knew it was him so he would put 666-8 which was a restaurant and
she said they dashed the time at 130 so that's how we communicated hmm we didn't
have cell phones was he did he listen like heavy metal music or was he like
into the devil no he liked no definitely not no no he was a traditional he liked
he liked Barry White he liked that type of music okay he liked Frank Sinatra of
course yeah you know Jerry Vale and I listened to all that even to this day I
still like that kind of music yeah yeah well cool man dude thank you so much this
was a it's a pleasure you know what I like about what I really enjoyed was we
talked about some different things you know I'm tired of talking about the
hits from before the war you know they did they were never easy I regret those
the hit store in the war talking about them it's a little easier because it was
kill or be killed you know and you know you had to survive and you couldn't show
weakness but a lot of people want to hear oh the first time you did this the
first time you did that I'm so happy you didn't do that there's there's more to
me than that yeah you know no I think it's it's a lot more fun do you see to
know somebody and just have a lose conversation then just like go you know
do bullet point questions like some of the other interviews yeah no definitely
Cal come here for a second I want to introduce my manager you don't mind do
you not at all you look great yeah my manager hi get get a little lower than
and I was I was her trainer that's how we met oh really in the gym yeah that's
boxing so that's a beautiful man yeah thank you I'm happy guys thank you so
much for being here again maybe we'll do it again so we're only a couple hours
away from each other we could do a part two for sure
