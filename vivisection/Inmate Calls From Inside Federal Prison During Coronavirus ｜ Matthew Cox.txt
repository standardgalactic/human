is he going to a halfway house I don't know who knows okay I have no idea that was fucking
crazy that just recently found out he was in prison this he's new how long not the first
time but he's this is a new how I did he go previously he's been in there for over 10 years
previously for a cocaine charge he's been out but he's a new charge this was a 90 he missed
the 90s he was in prison and then like for throughout the entire 90s and then he just
recently went back for some other charge so he's only in there for I think a year and a
half or two years right okay huh but what are the chances he's right where you were I mean
what you know I was thinking we didn't set that up they're literally set that up the phones are
like this so you're you're sitting there talking on the phone the other guys right here I mean
there's you know it's a phone booth this wide yeah and they're stacked besides so you've got this
much room with a phone so the other guys right next to you and his phone so you're all basically
shoulders shoulder yeah talking and that's what is in the in the the cells are about double the
size is this right here no and I've been double the size this about to here so they're like six
foot by maybe 10 feet maybe 11 feet with the bunk beds in there so when you're counting I mean
you're literally you guys are standing in there you're a foot away from you're always a foot or
two foot away from everybody all the time so if it gets in there they're pretty yeah you
just always say that that every time if one guy started coughing yeah within three days you could
lay in bed and just hear everybody all night just constantly because you get sick immediately so
you just start to wash your hands all the time I'd have to you have to sleep with a towel wrapped
around your head because people are screaming all the time and yelling it's ridiculous yeah
what do you want a laser printer
