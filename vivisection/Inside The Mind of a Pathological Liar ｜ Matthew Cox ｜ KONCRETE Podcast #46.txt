right now that's good though yeah it's good yeah a lot of content we're
cranking out a shitload of them which is cool but Matt Cox is back by a popular
demand how you doing good excellent so what are we gonna talk about today you
got a you got a book that you're about to publish right right called bailout
right this is one of the stories that you wrote when you were incarcerated on a
guy what's his name give me the give me the give me the quick back story on it
it's Marcus shrink Marcus shrinker was the financial crisis 2000 in 2008 in the
final financial during the financial crisis he was about to be indicted for
securities fraud he had a hedge fund or not hedge fund he had a wealth
management company right where he was basically just stealing from his
clients it was a mini Ponzi scheme very small Ponzi scheme well he was about to
be indicted and they'd already rated his office and he knew it's comp it was
coming well he also was a pilot so he devises this plan where he's gonna take
his plane up and he's going to call in a distress signal and say that the wind
shield has imploded and he's bleeding and you know I'm losing consciousness you
know a whole thing and then he's going to jump out of the plane and let the plane
fly out over the Gulf and run out of fuel and land in the Gulf the intro to that
story so the synopsis that I read on your website the first couple paragraphs
are they just grabbed they grabbed you by the throat that's like a great
intro to the story how it just starts out with him on the plane calling in the
distress call saying that his windows broken he's bleeding profusely grabs
the parachute who says profusely right in the heat of the moment like that I'm
jammed up I'm the last thing I'm gonna do is try and come off eloquent I got
issues going yeah I mean that's pretty ballsy to do something like that oh so
literally to go stride your plane and just jump out yeah listen it was
everywhere keep in mind too here's the problem so you saw it you when you were
inside when you were locked up you saw this on the news I yeah I advice how I
met him I mean I had already he was trying to fake his own death right correct
okay no of course what happens is he he does call he takes the plane up he calls
in the distress signal he sets the autopilot he goes out opens up the door
jumps out with a parachute and lands and the plane heads towards the golf
unfortunately for Marcus however comical for everyone watching because the door
opens up yeah there's more drag on the aircraft so his calculation of it will
go out 50 or 100 miles or 200 miles into the golf and crash was off because it
burned up too much fuel because it's no longer aerodine as as aerodynamic and so
it runs out of fuel about a mile or two before the golf and it crashes into a
swampy area yeah and he said remember he says you know that the that the windshield
had imploded well of course that whole plane if you've ever seen pictures if
you go to the website and look at the story and I have the pictures of the
plane though the tail's ripped off the wings are ripped off the whole thing is
I mean as it goes through this through the through the trees it's just total
yeah windshield still perfectly in perfectly intact not a scratch they
had not a crack on it when he landed and he went through the trees one of his
testicles got ripped off I mean you know that's what he said that's what he said
but anyway let's okay let's let's start from the beginning right so it so he so
the point is is that he gets he gets caught so what happens is I recall I
was already at the medium at that time and I remember seeing it like you had
asked I remember seeing it on CNN sitting there and they're talking about
this guy who had taken the plane out and they were looking for him and I'm like
something doesn't sound right so anyway years later I'm at the low and I'm
writing guys stories I'd written a Ephraim Deverelli story the guy from
war dogs I'd written a Doug Dodd story the guy that was in Rolling Stone we
I option or I was a part of the option for that film or so Shrinker comes to me
and he says to me you know hey I understand that you write guys stories
and I was like you know the family is so hard not to mock him the way talks he's
like he's like hi I understand I mean he it's it's so over-the-top dramatic yeah
so you know he does this whole hi I well Matt I just I don't understand how can
they it's just so pathetic but he comes up to me and he says I understand you
write guys stories and I'm like yeah I write guys stories and he's like I have
a story I'm Marcus shrinker and I was like oh yeah yeah Marcus I'd seen him
around I had had a conversation or two with him briefly and I said okay what's
up he's like well I have a story but I think I'm I remember that I should have
known right then he said I should have known something was wrong because he said
I think I'm finally ready to be honest about the story and I thought red flag
cool okay and I said well what's the story because your story is basically out
there right it's been told you've been on 2020 you've been on Dateline you've been
on you've been on all these major shows it was covered in every newspaper around
the world I mean there were newspapers in China that are there covering it was so
sensational who does this it's a movie it's right definitely so he says to me
I'm like I mean what's new he's like well you don't understand people don't
know the truth I'm like what's the truth that he was the truth is he said I
shouldn't be in prison at all he said you understand he said I didn't take the
money he was my wife pilfered all those accounts she was the CFO of our company
it was a large company and I didn't know what was happening by the time they
raided the office that's when I realized what she'd done he said and I divide I
didn't want her to be taken away from my children and so I devised a scheme to try
and you know sacrifice myself and jump out he said plus he said I had like
$11 million in life insurance and if I was dead she would get the money and my
kids would be taken care of and you know he said basically the whole economy was
melting down at the time so he said I just thought I thought I would do the
right thing and try and sacrifice myself and you know in their marriage was over
anyway so he has this whole thing where he tells me this story and you know look
I'm in prison I had no way to verify anything at that moment so talking to
him he is so sincere so over the top sincere you want to believe him and I
wanted to believe at that moment I wanted to believe that wow this is nothing
like what I'd heard yeah and I had seen like part of the episode of I almost got
away with it he had done I'd seen like the last half of it and so you know I
knew he'd jump out of the plane I knew all that and so I'm like wow okay so I
remember that night I went and I called my literary agent and talked to him his
name is Ross and I said Ross listen this guy Marcus Schrincker and he jumped out
of the plane he's like oh yeah yeah I've seen I know who you're talking about yeah
so he talks to me about it and I tell him yeah it's you don't understand his
wife she's the one that did it and I'm telling him all this and he's like oh
Matt he's he's lying to you mm-hmm and I went no no you don't understand he's
like no no I understand so I've read everything on this guy he's it I was
fascinated by this guy said I watched all the episodes of all the different
stories I've seen everything on him he's let me because look you don't have
access to the Internet he's let me print out some stuff so four days later I
get a stack of articles and a note from him saying look I'm sending you more
stuff yeah so when I read it and I see all these things that say he's a
pathological liar like there's several of his victims are saying look you can't
believe a thing he says his wife's like looks he's a liar I mean he lies all the
time and it his victims are like you know this guy's a path he's pathological
yeah so I go back to him and I sit down and I said okay well Marcus there's a
lot of stuff and I start talking to him you know there's a lot of stuff that
says that you know you're lying a lot of these are lies that you lie all the
time he's like oh Matt they they that's the newspapers they they lied they lied
they lied about you didn't they and I went exaggerated I said it's about 99
percent one or two things I'm irritated about yeah it's pretty accurate yeah you
know I would have written it a little differently yeah I would have come off a
little bit nicer so and and he's like well yeah they lied about me and this
and then I was like okay okay but as we talked I you know I just I was
fascinated after you when you know someone's a pathological liar and
they're talking to you and you start to really now you're analyzing everything
that they say and I kind of realized maybe I can get that's what really happened
out of this guy yeah maybe come he's never told anybody what really happened
it's always been a blatant lie yeah nobody really knows what's going on in
his head and he's never admitted to be a liar and nobody knows why he's a liar
or why he's pathological or how that developed or so I I asked Ross to send
me in a bunch of materials I had a at that point I believe I had I believe
Joy I had an assistant on the street that was working with me and keep in mind
too like all these people are doing all this for free so like my I had like an
assistant named Joy who was simply helping me for free why was she doing
that she loved the idea of me being in prison writing stories okay you know you
be shocked how many things I got just by writing a letter explaining this is I'm
in prison I got this much time this is what I did this is what I'm doing now
and I need some help can you please do this for me and they would you know I had
this one time I had a transcript I needed it's like 50 60 bucks for the
transcript so I write a letter to the transcriptionist right to the court
reporter and I said look you want like $60 for this transcript and I said I'm on
a budget I make this much money every month you know I'm in prison for this
long and it might seem silly but I write true crime stories and I would like to
get a copy of this transcript but you want $60 for it I don't need it right
away and I'm not using it for legal purposes so if you could do it at your
leisure simply so that I could get some excerpts from it it would really help
me out and I would really appreciate that and I'm asking you I'm not asking
you to do it for free I'm asking you to try and give me some kind of a discount
just help me out here you know a dollar a page instead of 350 a page something
and about a week later I got the transcript so keep mine she had to get
that letter and then she had to transcribe it nope it wasn't already
transcribed she then sent me the transcription with a letter that said
you know I read your letter I like the idea of what you're doing I wish you
the best of luck and here's the transcript for free yeah no charge good
luck yeah I was like whoa yeah that's a hell of a price I wrote a letter back
saying listen I don't get a lot of breaks yeah you know I appreciate that
that's over the top nice that was I really appreciate I said yeah I told her
you rock yeah you know so so what happens is raw start sending me in stuff
on on path on pathological iris your literary agent my literary agent I
also start ordering the freedom of information at keep mine I tell all
these guys the same thing okay listen and I had this conversation with
shrinker listen I'll write the story I find it interesting but you need to know
up front I'm gonna order documents I'm going to request transcripts I'm
requesting that I'm good you're not you may have to sign some stuff I may get
called into the lieutenant's lieutenant's office or to SIS and they may ask
me why are you getting documents sent to you and you may have to be called up
there to the vouch for me I need to know that you'll do that is of course man
of course I'll do that yeah so I said and on top of that I said when the store as
the story progresses and when I'm done with it I give it to you you may not be
thrilled with this story right I'm gonna write the story the way I see it and you
don't really have any input you know if I get some things that are actually wrong
that I'm I'm willing to make those alterations but they have to be factual
right and if I have you know if I have if I'm getting facts in additional
information that doesn't corroborate what you're saying we have to have a
discussion we have to figure out what's going on right absolutely man of course
I'm not lying I wouldn't lie I don't lie Matt I mean it was just it was just wow
oh so I started ordering all the documents I start writing a story what's
funny is one of the things I got was I read so got several reports on pathological
liars and there's not a lot of stuff I read a book got a book this one book in
there's really only like one or two books one of them I think was called lies
lies lies the psychology of deception okay and it talks all about pathological
liars and all these studies that had been done yeah a lot of them I noticed in
your schnapps is there's a lot of quotes from like psychiatrists that study
that kind of stuff right some of those were taken from actual published
reports or studies that I got like I got condensed studies yeah sent in 10 pages
six pages and they explained like they would take kids and they do all these
things and adults and how to spot someone who's lying and that sort of thing is
virtually impossible it talks about their brain chemistry yeah and it also
talks about the different types of pathological liars okay so he's based
on my you know me being a novice and not really and I'm not a doctor or anything
but he seemed to fall into the realm of being what's called a pseudo fantastical
pathological liar which is that he tells a consistent lie and he's told these
lies and they're within reason but he's told them throughout his whole life and
he's built up this false persona of who he is so that he can continue to say you
know brag okay and lie and and then one of the things that they talk about
pathological liars that most pathological liars it develops when
their children and so I'm reading this about how it develops when you're a
child and he doesn't realize that I'm reading all this doesn't know that I'm
getting these reports doesn't know I'm reading it and yet he is I mean he is
the quintessential pathological liar I mean he he falls every category he falls
in here he nails it like abusive parents being abused as a child not wanting to be
the person he is being in a bad position yeah well can you give me one of the
examples in the synopsis of like child abuse like I think there's a couple
specifics I don't know if you remember him right now but yeah what he said and
keep on in the book so I have like a book that's coming out right so you know
you read that you know the synopsis well in the book I talk about a little bit
more into it and when I say child abuse I just mean that according to shrinker
you know his mother was an alcoholic and his mother married a guy that was an
alcoholic his father was a great guy his real father but his mother was an
alcoholic he's according to him and his stepfather was and his stepfather used
to beat him and his brothers and his mother and at one point he was actually
hospitalized his he had well he'd been beaten and he fought back and he ends up
beating up his stepfather and but he gets taken away and instead of going to
like a juvenile facility they he says they place him in a mental hospital for
I don't know how long it was 30 days or 60 days or 90 I forget I have it it's in
the book so and he has to go through all these things they don't catch the fact
that he's a pathological liar because by this point remember at one point during
the writing of the story I explained to him well my first start I said look you
know one of the issues is everything that's out there talks about these
lies and he of course you know man I don't lie you know I'm not saying you
lie what I'm saying is that at one point in your life you did lie so I'm trying
to kind of coax him into helping me out and so I'm trying to convince him to
tell me the truth mm-hmm but but keep in mind too I'm reading these reports so
I'm realizing he'll he'll tell me the truth if he thinks it's in his best
interest right so I have to make I have to explain to you that by admitting to a
pathological admitting your pathological liar is in your best interest right
right so I explained to him that look it's better for you to admit that your
pathological liar now early on let's get ahead of this and not I never say
pathological liar I would say habitual liar that you had an issue with lying so
let's talk about how let's address it head on that you had an issue and that
you did lie and you don't lie now but you did lie at one point and and let's
talk about that and why you lied and so I said that way it builds trust with the
reader so if you say these things up front later on if you happen to have to
say something that they don't believe or shouldn't believe they will believe you
because there's no reason that you would have admitted to these other things and
then lied about this mm-hmm yeah I think there was a part in there where he when
he was a young child it started where he would have to lie to his friends where
they wanted to go to his house and he would have to make up a lie about why
they couldn't go to his house like it was being fumigated or something but he
just didn't want people to go over there and see what was actually going on in
his house with his stepdad and his mom right right that's the first lie he
told me I said can you tell me that can you remember the very first lie and he
said I don't know if it's the first I said but the very first like I can
remember telling is he said that his parents were basically they were
arguing and about to get he said he could tell it was about to boil over into
a full-blown screaming argument where they're throwing dishes and shit and
he said I could tell in his some kids in the neighborhood showed up wanted to
play like Atari or something and he was like we can't play here because they're
my stepfather's painting the inside of the house so we got to go to your house
and they were like okay and he was like that was like the first time I lied so
it was like he was like like hardwired to lie almost just well he everybody lies
yeah you know kids lie it's funny because you know the statistic that I had
read in a couple different things a couple different of those studies was
that men and women lie the about the same really yeah right so if if and I mean
on average you tell a lie like I forget it's ridiculous is like every 14 minutes
in a conversation or every seven minutes it's out now they're they're minor lies
you know like like like man that's it that's I love that camo you know what
the truth is I don't like the camo it's ridiculous it looks like pajamas I'm
not gonna say that they consider that a lie so you know or and what's so funny
is that men and women lie the same but men ten eighty percent of men males lie
to make themselves look better 20% they do it to make someone else feel better
women 80% of the time they lie to make someone else feel better 20% to make
themselves feel better hmm so I mean it just kind of shows like what selfish
prick men are yeah you know wow so he he just lies about everything yeah so yeah
I talked we talked about that in the the first time he told a lie and and how it
developed and and then he starts just it just it keeps going and going to the
point where he starts lying for no reason at all these these guys would lie he
would do something and he tells me this by the way he explains he's explaining to
me he said he just got to the point where he said I would I would say that
like my brother like we were going to we were gonna go to Disney World over the
weekend I tell all his friends at school oh yeah my my my stepdad's gonna bring
the whole family to Disney World we're leaving Friday and we're gonna go all
weekend we're gonna drive down to Florida and go to Disney World okay well
then on on Monday they'd say did you go to Disney World he go no I couldn't
because my my brother broke his arm his brother goes the same school he's walking
around with no broken arm no broken arm yeah and then but you know I'm saying
why would you say that right you know it's you're very quickly going to be
discovered that that's a lie yeah does it anyway he'd do it to me you know he
do it all the time guys would say if you just didn't and he didn't care or people
never called him out or he just because it's so stupid or he would say I never
said that plus you gotta think their defense mechanism mechanism is to get
angry typically right so you know like can you imagine his wife his wife doesn't
call him on it you know she's 120 pounds you know he's 190 pounds and he's you
know he's he's he gets angry and he yells and screams and and I'd seen him do
it he done it to me several times with I pushed he would be like I don't have to
put up with this bullshit man this is bullshit I don't have to fucking and he
get up and walk a walk walk off I think okay that's it we're not working
together it's not gonna happen he's done he's pissed at me it's just he's not
gonna cooperate three days later he go hey Matt I was what what are we meeting
again like it never happened but I realized how far to push him and and how
to coax him into telling me what really happened so he starts you know we we
talk about childhood and the different lies and how to start lying so much and
they're not beneficial lies necessarily right they're just lies to make
himself feel good what do you get everybody else is doing something for
the weekend what are you doing Marcus you know oh we're going to Disney World
you know he's a little kid yeah so it just became there were so many lies to
cover for his family or for his embarrassment that somehow or another
becomes they start to feel natural and it feels good to fool people you know it
feels good that I've convinced you that this is what's happening mm-hmm or that
I'm special and keep on it that follows him throughout his whole life keep
mind this guy's a pilot he ends up getting he's got a series 67 series 7
or series 63 series 7 he's got all of his licenses right all of his insurance
licenses he's got everything he owns his own wealth management firm he owns a
couple planes he's a stunt pilot he's got an amazing looking wife he's got what
three beautiful kids he lives in a 10,000 square foot house why do you have
to lie and tell people that you used to work for NASA and fly f-15s aren't you
already at the top right it's good enough for you're you're a top shelf
individual already yeah he's still lying I just can't help it right I mean so you
have to know it's pathological I mean he just can't stop so we we so I keep
telling the story about how it we ping between we'd be being in prison
interviewing him and telling the story and periodically you know I know what
the story is because I'm getting the documents it I'm getting stuff in from
keep my everything I got freedom of information federal and I hit every
single state that he dealt with so I've got documents not just from the US
attorney's office can you hold up that stack of documents so the camera can see
it hold up by your face this is what Matt brought in today yeah this is hold a
sideways means how thick it is this is this is a third of it I threw up twice
this much out because it was repetitive okay how many times do I need that's an
absurd amount of paperwork yeah oh this and this is you know this is a huge
affidavit this is this is um this is a sentencing memorandum you know these are
affidavits for this is an affidavit this is I've got victim statements I've got
what's really great is the letters from the the internal notes and emails that I
have from the all the different insurance agencies okay like in Texas and
Indiana and where they're writing back and forth to each other like the
different agencies are writing back and forth like now this guy's a fucking to
each other he's a piece of garbage he's like they're just they're they're
blasting him they're like look he's ripping people off he's done this we
think he's running a a churning scam we think he's running this kind of a scam
and they're going back and forth back and forth so all of things that he's not
telling me nor do I think he necessarily knows all of that so as you know he
starts telling me how things progressed in his life okay and some stuff I can
verify some stuff I can't did he go to Purdue I can verify I went to Purdue
because I've got newspaper articles I don't get anything from Purdue they
didn't answer requests they're not a government agency so I do get I couldn't
get anything to verify that he was actually in a mental institution as a
child but he did tell a reporter that and I have that so had I had he just said
I would have been would have questioned whether how much did really how much
validity it had however I did get a couple articles that specifically talk
about how he's told this story before so I have proof that this is something he
constantly says at least at least it's a consistent lie right and then you know
it goes on and on then eventually he ends up he ends up working for he
graduates he becomes a pilot he ends up graduating Purdue University with a
degree in finance and aeronautics according to him you know and really
according to some different articles and stuff talk about how he graduated
Purdue so then he he goes to work for John Hancock which is an insurance
okay selling different products you know they sell like annuities things like
that mm-hmm so then he ends up opening up his own his own firm which was a
heritage wealth management it had a couple different names you know he's
constantly kind of shifting the names around but they're all basically heritage
wealth management heritage financial services heritage so anyway so what ends
up happening is I start getting the documents in that talk about the
lawsuits and the different scams that he's running and his major scam was his
main scam that he made the most money at by the way was the churning scam where
he would convince people to invest in he and index annuities right and an
index annuities and an insurance product keep in mind he also he he would do
stocks you know he would buy some stocks and sell stocks too but he was
explaining to me there's not a lot of money in stocks you know as a stock
broker and he's like and nobody has like the edge he's like I mean they're all
pretty much the same you know you might make one half a percent maybe two percent
on a sale he's like okay so big deal right people aren't buying hundred
thousand dollars worth of shares you know up in Indiana yeah you know they're
buying you know put five thousand you know what's he getting two percent of
five thousand that's nothing right so he starts selling these indexed annuities
because the market had taken a crash this is like after the bubble had burst
the tech bubble had burst and so he starts selling these index annuities and
what he does is he's he starts targeting pilots because he's a pilot so he can
talk pilot talk to them and aeronautics and they get it and he gets it and they
like him and develop a good rapport with right and then they're giving him
other pilots right we're gonna talk to my buddy John it's kind of niche right so
he starts telling the pilots he used to work for Delta by the way and he used to
work for NASA and he's also telling them he used to fly F-15s or I think it's
a 10 word hogs or something like that yeah in in like it's just it's just not
it's just ridiculous I mean like during Desert Storm he was tell he would tell
people he was he was an F he flew F-15s or F-16s or something during Desert
Storm mm-hmm okay well you were like 18 yeah or you would be the youngest pilot
in history you know there's you know or fighter pilot right right you have to
get your degree you have to then you have to go through school all the
schooling then you have this no way right at least 23 24 25 years old by
time you're flying but these guys on the phone that he's selling annuities to
they aren't doing the math they don't know they don't know really how old he is
right so and and what's happening is he's so you put you give me a hundred
let's say you give me twenty thousand dollars well in the annuities he's not
making one or two percent he's making like 15 percent so you give me ten
grand I'm making fifteen hundred bucks and most of these guys are putting in
big money they're putting a hundred thousand because he's pitching the
annuities as being a very safe product mm-hmm which I guess they are but they're
not lucrative they don't make a lot of money they don't make it's not a huge
return what happens is that for the first year it would guarantee you a
return of let's say whatever I'll make it up the numbers seven percent or let's
say even if it's ten percent oh yeah it's ten percent and he would be like it's
ten percent guaranteed return for the first year and after that if you're it
if it changes you could pull your money out what you can that's true but there's
a surrender what's called a surrender fee so you pull your money out you lose
twenty percent you get it yeah right so you give me a hundred thousand dollars
shrinker might make twelve percent he just made twelve grand you might make
ten percent on your over the next year but then in a year it drops down to like
one percent or zero percent and so suddenly they would turn around they'd
say oh I want my money back right or let's take my money out of that put it
into something else mm-hmm and he would say okay and then he pulled the money out
well they would hit him with a surrender fee he'd buy some other product with it
some stocks or whatever they wanted to do and then they would go wait a second
shrinker they they they took twenty percent of my money they only cut me a
check back for you know whatever eighty-eight thousand instead of the
hundred and ten thousand yeah and he would say you know I don't know that's
strange that is weird keep in mind too he's got the money he's making up
documents he so even if you figure it out eventually and typically what he would
do also is he would convince them not to pull the money out initially he'd say
look it's a bad quarter let's wait till next quarter mm-hmm so now it's been a
year and change mm-hmm so a year and so quarter so three months later he might
get you to go again hey look it's gonna change it's gonna go up we need to stick
with this so now it's been 18 months then he pulls it out they hit you with the
surrender fee with the fee now all the documents you sold or you signed were
18 months ago and when you say hey man they hit me with 20% he says well yeah I
told you about the surrender fee or he says that's crazy yeah I can't believe
they did that I'm gonna take care of this and he he writes them and says look
I'm talking to them I have a meeting not next week but the week after I'm gonna
get to the bottom of this he spins them and spins them and spins them on months
go by you know maybe he wears them down maybe they get frustrated they go away
but he's got all the documents where they signed saying they understood there
was a surrender fee and I remember convincing him what I was gonna say no
did he like just hide that in all the paperwork never saw it or was it even
in there to begin with oh yeah it's in there it was in there these are documents
that came from the from the insurance company and what happens is like the
Apple terms of service when you sign when you sit when you scroll through all
that shit and just hit accept right nobody nobody's reading right and I
remember I explained to him you know he was saying I was saying did you just
disclose the surrender fee I don't understand why and he'd say you know
well I mean you know Matt those there's those documents are and I remember
thinking he's about to lie to me I want to catch him before he lies to me and so
I remember saying listen man I mean I get it I get what I get it because I I
own a mortgage company how many people have disclosed or I think you know
many times I would put the documents down and I would just run through the
disclosures and I'd say you know this is for the insurance and such and such this
is stating this this is stating that this is stating the prepayment penalty
this is stating the prepayment penalty is only 1% of the you know of the of your
payment this is stating this this is stating that you're going to carry
interest so I said I just go I said what did you do I said because I would do
that guys would just sign and sign and I'd be like I'd flip it over and I'd say
sign here I got my hand over the document now you can't read this I'm going
you you know I'm saying I've got my hand so I'm going sign here sign here sign
here check my watch so you sign real quick because I just told you what it is
right even if you said look do you want to sit here for 45 minutes and read these
there we go right no I'll just sign right exactly so he would disclose and he
wouldn't disclose the surrender fee but they would sign right and it's in there
18 months later if they really start to bitch and moan and some some lawyer
shows up or somebody says anything he can always say they signed it you signed it
I did disclose this I don't ever remember you well I mean I trust me I always
disclose properly sure and you don't remember because it was 18 months ago
right you were happy with the 10% you weren't going to pull out your money
we had a you had a bad couple of quarters now you're trying to pull out now
suddenly you conveniently don't remember that I disclosed it come on man so what can
they do so he's doing this over and over again and he's getting people getting
more and more of these guys and then Delta ends up like closing or something
one of these big companies closes Delta or Eastern I forget which one they close
and so all these pilots get their pensions and so now he's getting guys that have
$900,000 oh shit because they're cutting them checks like look we're not running
your pension fund anymore here's your $200,000 go do something with it so now
he's getting this money and putting it into these these things he ends up and
then of course these people have families so they're talking about what great
investments this guy's running he is he ends up selling um one guy is 70 there's
a a guy a pilot's father who I think is 70 years old he sells him a 15 year
annuity so that means the first year was like 10% return shrinkery because it was
such a long annuity shrinker gets like 18% return the guy put in a million
dollars that's 180 thousand dollars right shrinker right shrink here's 180 he
signs he's happy for about a year then it changes keep in mind the guy's 70 for
before for him to get his money back and have earned anything he's it's a 15 year
annuity he has to wait 15 years right so it's 85 then he's a yeah he's lucky to
make it 85 probably what are the chances he's 85 right he's gonna make it I mean
he had one guy that I think he was like 80 and so he would have had to be like 95
I actually have like in the book I actually go over all of them I have some of the letters I
you know I um I scale down the letters obviously because you know they're just
outrageous some letters that he's writing but some of these people are writing these
angry furious letters back and he's writing back these ridiculous responses really so
this is going back and forth back and forth eventually though he ends up getting this
one group of investors and they're not having it I'm like like he can't convince them to just
get frustrated and go away they file with every reports with everybody complaints with everybody
to it to the point where eventually all of the these different states start investigating
shrinker and they start calling him in and having him answer questions and start telling him you
either you surrender your insurance license or we're going to file criminal charges so this group
explain this group again this was a group of customers right I call them the the client group
the client group right and it was made up of the um how are they all associated with each other
like why they were all pilots they were all pilots so one it's like one guy's a pilot his
brother's a pilot one's guy is like a Delta Eastern pilot he's brothers a pilot and then he knew
other pilots and then he was in charge of investing his parents money he gives them
like a little over I think it was nine nine hundred thousand or a little slightly over a
million it's around a million okay he gives that money to shrinker I mean shrinkers just he's just
non-stop he's just pulling money in yeah so it's uh you know of course shrinkers by this point he's a
he's a he's a stunt pilot so he's flying around the country um around the world really at doing
stunt shows and he's a special why is he doing that you know they're it's just like a hobby right
these the you know they're they have poor impulse control there's a pathological
liar they have poor impulse control so so they they tend to be thrill seeking okay and so he's
a pilot being a pilot's not good enough yeah I gotta be a stunt pilot yeah you know which like
it's not crazy enough to just be a pilot which to me is I wouldn't I just it seems like a
immense responsibility and things could go wrong and I just yeah right that's not good enough I need
to do loop-de-loops yeah fucking flips and shit right I mean he crashes his plane you know and I
talked about how he crashes his plane he ends up hurting his back he ends up getting hooked on opiates
in the stunt shows or something like the Bahamas right right landing your clip the water yeah
and it did like a death roll and he crushed his spine right fuck yeah yeah it's it's it's rough
and then he got addicted to what was it uh oxy oxy listen and the only reason I believe that
is because when they caught him I have a list of everything that was everything that was
inventoried when they caught him and they had a prescription of oxy kota and extra scripts in
other people's names yeah so oh yeah well like he had a script in his brother's name okay so and he
had them in his name so that followed suit with what he was telling me already so I felt good
about that you know there's certain things you you start going I don't know this sounds this sounds
kind of contrived this little story about how man I was I was hooked on oxy so you know I wasn't
thinking right it's like it could be an excuse but then you find evidence and you connect the dots
I'm gonna run with that yeah that's I'm I feel confident about that so but like I remember this
is one of the things uh we talked about or I talked about was uh when he starts getting sued by all
these insurance companies and I'm writing the book in prison and I'm meeting with them and I'm going
there and I'm so so go so go back there's a group of people that are that are filing complaints
against him right with the insurance companies and he's somehow licensed with all these insurance
companies around the country around the country yeah and they're revoking his licenses back to
back to back he's literally getting shut down by every insurance company yeah okay I mean it's uh
these things so he's going out of business basically fuck him up I mean they jam him up like
he's never saw it coming and he's not in prison at that time yet no because they're they're the
they're trying to wrap it up quick so if you're an insurance you know investigator or something
you're like look I just don't want this guy selling insurance anymore right so just give us your license
back get out of our state right don't don't sell anything else in our state and he's compliant
he's just like okay whatever I just don't want to be involved I don't want to be charged he doesn't
want to get charged right he's not admitting anything he's just saying well well I wouldn't do this
but I understand what you're saying I'll just give up the license I doesn't matter I never sell
anything in this state if he was innocent he probably would fight fight back right well what
happens is once one of them one or two of the states do it they start notifying each other
different states now they're all talking now they're talking and so it's okay you lost your license in
Texas right and you lost it in Indiana and here's their their report oh hell no you're not selling in
you're not selling in Georgia right you're not selling in Florida uh-huh so they start they start
he starts getting these letters like within a week or two just bam bam and then the insurance
companies he's all signed up with they start canceling his abilities they start sending him letters
saying you know you're no longer a licensed agent don't sell our products don't advertise our
products just bam bam within a month he shut down completely he packs his shit up and leaves
Atlanta because he'd moved to Atlanta he was back to Indiana so uh yeah he sees and he's done
at this point he's married with kids right oh yeah married to so what about his family what's
I mean he's got a wife named Michelle uh-huh do they know what's going on um you know what what I
read was that well first of all he's he's not the kind of person that's going to admit to anything
right so he's probably lying to them yeah he's never going to bring you into his confidence because
he's trying to present a persona like everything's all right I'm a super successful person right
I'm Superman I mean I'm just amazing I'm I'm a pilot I'm and keep in mind remember I'm not just a
pilot he's telling people I used to work for NASA well he really was a stunt pilot though at least
that's good enough isn't it right so I'm a stunt pilot nope yeah he also has to say he worked for
NASA keep in mind I've got guys coming up to me I remember that the I think I put it in the synopsis
where I was guys start to realize I'm writing shrinker story some of the guys that you're in
locked up with locked up with right now keep in mind too I was at the time while this is happening
I'm I'm actually eating lunch with a couple of con men two other guys that are locked up for being
common and so we're talking and he's they're all saying how's the story going I'm like you
know he's lying about this he's lying they're like look you got to do this you guys so we're
we're like they're helping you they're helping me figure out how to manipulate him into telling
me what happened and they're like well you know it's you know why don't you just confront him and
I'm like I can't yes Vanessa here's what he's doing if I do that he he gets angry he leaves he
explains about the pathological liar about his defense mechanism about you know and so
so they're helping me kind of coax the truth out of him but eventually I'm also eating with guys
that work out with him that hang out with him I remember I ate lunch one time with this guy
the guy I call him a cocaine or cowboy his name is uh uh Mike Hudson and so Mike goes oh so you're
writing uh he's like 60 something years old he's a massive big guy he goes he goes so I uh so you're
writing shrinker story huh and I went yeah yeah I am and he goes man he said he said well so what's
that like I said well you know jumped out of the plane did all that and he goes I'm not telling him
he's a pathological liar I'm just like you know yeah you know I'm just just just a big case and he
goes yeah he's a he's a shit he did in Afghanistan alone is worth writing about you're like what the
fuck what what did he do in Afghanistan oh he flew a 10 warthogs I forget exactly what he told me
I have it written down because I took notes because I mean I like immediately went back
and and wrote down right you know I have all these I have all the notes so I've like I immediately
like go back to my the unit like right now yeah yeah so he was like he flew the 120 sorties he took
out 40 armored car personnel and um uh and a russian t-80 tanks uh you know single-handedly
and I'm going when to do this when he was in the air force or the army or whatever in the military
and I look and I was like I mean I just started laughing I actually think I think I blew like
coke out of my nose or something you know it's like a laugh so I go are you serious and he goes
yeah he didn't tell you that I said I mean Mike I said he was he was never in the military
he's well what do you mean what why would he say that I said it's a pathological liar bro he lies
about everything and he's like what so we start talking he's like that piece of shit and he goes
what about NASA did he work for NASA what about NASA it worked for NASA and he wasn't the only
person I've had like I've had I had like five or six guys tell me you know hey man you gotta put
that shit in about NASA what you know so that was one of his favorite ones that was yeah that's
kind of he builds a a fantasy life yeah right that he can continue to go back to and I even asked him
at one point I said listen I said these things that you're telling people you know like I had
quotes so he he knew that you knew that he did not work for NASA and all this stuff right he knew
like right you and him had come cleaning on that yeah he wouldn't tell me that right he would he
would tell me that well yeah I said that but I said it be only because only the pilots or I only
said it to this person or I only said it because this person did this and I wanted them to think
that you know we were we were in it together whatever to at the same point you couldn't
actually confront him by like why are you telling everybody this because then he would like throw
his defense mechanisms and right he would so I would a little bit you know well I don't understand
and he kind of explain trying to explain it away and I remember when I asked him about Michelle
his wife and I said Marcus clearly she knows that these things are happening did she did you ever
she ever confront you or say anything and he said he was only once that I can recall
he said we only had one civil conversation about he said we were getting the arguments and she'd
scream at me and yell at me it was always her fault right not the fact that you're a lie a piece
of garbage um so he says one time they had had dinner and he had talked about he'd bullshitted
about flying jets or f-15s or something to some of their friends and then on the way home
Michelle said to him why do you do that why do you tell those stories you know she's like basically
she's like why do you lie you do it all the time and he was like I mean shocked that yeah shocked
that she even said that she called him out right because he said she we never it just it wasn't
that kind of relationship she was an unspoken thing well she was in an enabler you know she's
enabling him to behave this way because she's enjoying the lifestyle and everything that
comes with it so why would she fucking expose him she's got nice vehicles she's trading in her car
every year she's getting brand new cars my husband's a stunt pilot he's a pilot we've got a
one or two million dollar aircraft we can go anywhere anytime we live in a 10,000 square foot
house we're two or three million dollars I mean she's she's doing well yeah and do I does and
shrinkers a good-looking guy so the fact that he's also a liar he looks good in the family photo
right and she's more concerned about the kids yeah her job according to a transcript I read
of hers was she's like I don't deal with the business I deal with the family and my job is
raising my three children I don't focus on what he's doing over here but he told me at one point
she actually said to him you know why are you doing this and he says you know this is are you
going back to the car right yeah they're riding on the way home and yeah from dinner and she says
or he says he was I didn't know what to say he said I basically just told her well what
does it matter whatever I'm doing we're doing well it's working whatever I'm doing is working so
don't worry about it and she goes yeah but those aren't clients you're not lying to clients these
are my friends right to get anything out of it right we're just at dinner and you're just
fucking lying and keep in mind her friend like it's sport right he just couldn't help but
but exaggerate and fool these people into believing that he's a you know a fighter pilot yeah so
he said it just didn't go anywhere and he was like you know I didn't know what the you know
I didn't know how to answer and I didn't know what to say and he said but that's pretty much the
only time she ever we ever really had a civil conversation everything else was screaming matches
he said so he said you don't really get anything that way that way of course he always takes off
for screens or dollars or and she basically just enables him anyway she just puts up with it yeah so
yeah so when when all the everything went wrong because of the client group and they
start hammering away at him and they've shut him down in all these different states and he's now
he's really in trouble and keep in mind we're in the middle of financial crisis at this point
he uh he's being sued by all these companies so now these companies are coming out saying
the insurance companies insurance companies are now saying we want our $1.5 million that
we paid you back we want our $2.3 million that we paid you back we want so you that those numbers
alone we want half a million dollars back that those numbers alone let you know how lucrative
this was I mean he's got $10 million worth of just lawsuits coming at him left and right
and I remember when I went to him and I said to him Marcus will tell me about the the lawsuits
you remember reading this oh yeah so I remember where exactly where I even put I think I even put
at least I know in the book I put exactly where it was I was and we were actually in front of
vocational tech or Votek which is a building in the prison and we were there in front of the
building I remember coming up to him and saying look we need to talk about these lawsuits yeah
Matt what lawsuits keep in mind I know right I already know this is coming because he's the
stories he's telling me is all about kind of more about Michelle yeah and so I know we're leading
up to where Michelle stole all the money not him right so he's admitting some stuff but
he's really trying to paint her as bad as he can well I go up to him with a pile of paper like this
I mean literally he was bigger than this so I go up to him and I say listen Marcus man we got to
talk about the lawsuits because and he was what lawsuits and I go the lawsuits that you were
being sued why would you say that and what will Marcus I read in the newspaper Matt they lied
that's not true so you've never been sued no of course not has heritage wealth management ever
been sued any of the heritage company has been sued no any of the companies you've been you've
owned no of course not have you ever been sued on behalf of the company no Matt I would think I
would know if I'd been sued and he does this whole thing I go okay I go here's here's AG
life insurance company out of Texas they sued you for 1.5 million dollars what he's what
he's what where did you get this and I go what I got I got I ordered the freedom of information
act they sent it to me yeah and he goes I don't I I've never um and I go do you remember this
because I said you signed for it and he's like I um um okay yeah yeah that yeah I was sued here
I was sued here yes I do you're right now I remember yes I was sued this one time so you've
never been sued any other times madam no this is it so there's no other lawsuits I'm going to come
up with yeah no of course not okay mutual life insurance company sued you for 2.3 million dollars
he was no I never should have been sued here I shouldn't have been sued he said you were sued
at all right five minutes ago you said you were never sued you were never sued and he goes I said
now you're telling me there's no more lawsuits I said I mean he's okay Matt I now I understand why
you're confused because it's my fault yeah now he has understanding he is now I understand why
you're confused he said are you confused because you're lying to me no no he said Matt what happened
he said what what's going on is is that heritage wealth management they were sued I said no they
were sued you were sued on behalf of the company and you were sued as a private person you were
just crossed the board they're suing you you're done every way every which way yeah and he's he's
like and he literally went and I said Marcus I mean I start pulling out different lawsuits
this one and this one and this and he goes Matt I because I Matt I don't understand what this is
coming from I mean I owned a large wealth management company of course we were sued we were sued all
the time it would be strange if we weren't sued and I mean it was just like fucking bizarre right
wow who in I every time I've talked to the guys are like well why didn't you confront them like
there and say you know you oh you just said it doesn't work right he's just gonna shut down he
shuts down he gets angry he screams he hollers so instead you just skate over that just let's just
go looking gloss right you just let him know that you know right so you say okay okay well
that makes sense you were sued all the time that makes sense so what happened in this lawsuit
is this the one where you the guy a Reese Mr Reese you you got the annuity and I we start talking
yeah that's so we start talking about now he he's done I painted him into a corner now he just
just tells me what happened you could see it in his face bro when I would show up for these meetings
towards the end when he everything was unraveling yeah I just beaten the hell out of him yeah he was
just he'd look up and be like you could see when I would pull out some paperwork and and I go okay
so listen I got this something in the mail here uh from the Texas Department of Insurance
and you could see him go oh fuck oh my god he's gotta be miserable for him please tell me he didn't
get the yeah get mine too I don't want him to stop working with me either right so you know I would
give him a little here a little there and coax him a little bit and then eventually and I'd convince
him that what he that we were kindred spirits right like you don't have to lie to me right you lie to
these other suckers right tell him about the stuff that you did to make him feel like you guys have
right I would tell him I did this one time I did this I'm gonna make up shit I did this one oh my
god those fuck one an idiot and he would get excited listening to me and he has to one of
me right he likes that right he can't say we're both pilots he's gotta say I work for NASA yeah yeah
he so I'm I'm saying yeah this and one time I did this with this client this with this client and
and he would go he'd be like oh that's nothing one time I had a client sign this and he had no idea
one time he says hey I had clients sometimes they never signed anything and I just took the money
out of their their account and I'd be like okay I go so that's so that's what happened with the
you know with the Johnson's right and he'd go well and he realized fuck yeah he fucked himself
right so because I got this document right here and he'd be like oh god I'd pull it out and he'd go
yeah see what yeah and he'd tell me what happened so you know it was just it was just straight
insanity bro wow it was just the guy's just nuts wow so eventually he gets shut down completely
and he shifts to I just want to tell this one this the one story about where he shifts it to a
Ponzi scheme the whole economy's collapsed nobody that money's just non-existent nobody's lending
anybody anything what year's this 2008 I would say late 2008 early I think it was 2000 2008
yes 2008 when everything was just shut off right so because he jumps out of the plane in like 2009
beginning of 2009 so everything's just shut off in 2008 he shifts because he can't do the annuity
scam anymore is what's called the churning scam yeah insurance company shut him down right so what
he's doing now is he switches to running a gosh it's a it's a forex scam so he runs basically it's
a Ponzi scam and the forex he uses forex to say he's trading currencies so I'm going to trade
currencies I'm trading the euro against the dollar because the euro was actually going up at that
point yeah so he he starts going to different investors and saying look I've got this currency
you know fund that I'm you know we're we're I'm betting against you know I'm betting on the
against the dollar or betting against the euro or betting for the or whatever however they do it
and people are giving him money 50,000 here 100,000 here 20,000 here he's not investing it yeah he's
just paying his bills right you know the Lexus the Lexus payments do my $10,000 a month house
payments do yeah my I mean he's just paying his bills what's so funny is I have the document that
comes in where they would show where the government's like look $60,000 check 15,000 went here 5,000
went here 4,000 went here 10,000 went here and they literally he deposited on a Monday and
by Friday the whole thing's drained it's gone yeah he's paying his personal bills personal bills so
you can't even say well I did trade some of the money or I meant to there's no fun there's no
fund you're just stealing yeah so and he's lying to everybody to get him to steal but I remember
this this is the one story and I can't remember the name of the woman at some some points keep
in mind he's got he's he has control over your money so at some point sometimes he would need
money he would just take the money he'd just write himself a check out of your account for
10 grand and maybe a month later he put it back when some more money came in so this one woman
checks her account one day and realizes that like 10 grand's missing
and so she calls him up and says Marcus I just checked our our fidelity account and $10,000
is gone and he says it is he is well you know what um oh yeah yeah he said I invested that in the
in the currency in the the the our Euro fund it's a currency fund you know it's a forex fund I'm
trading and she and she said he he said oh your husband whatever the name is Mark oh yeah I talked
to Mark Mark okay to she's always never said anything to me keep in mind what he just said
Mark said it was okay right he knows she's gonna call Mark right obviously she's gonna say their
husband yeah so he is oh yeah yeah Mark author authorized it she says oh okay I'm so sorry
she hangs up the phone he sits back and waits because he knows she's calling back right she calls
back and she says I just talked to Mark and he said he did not absolutely tell you that he could
do that he goes what hold on a second let me put you on hold on let me let me talk to my secretary
puts her on hold kicks back waits wonders where they're gonna send them to prison you know yeah
will Michelle bring the kids to see me you know that kind of stuff waits a little bit gets back
on the phone and says listen I just talked to my secretary I had given her a list of investors
that I wanted her to contact to get authority to put money into the Euro fund she checked off
the different names that she called the left messages for I thought that meant that those people
had okayed the investment so that was my mistake and I apologize and he said I'm so sorry I'm gonna
go ahead and I will put the money back in the account you know by tomorrow you'll have the money
or whatever he said plus your returns he was which is $1800 and she goes $1800 he is yeah he
was well I mean it's been in there for a month almost a month she says you made $1800 with $10,000
in less than a month he's yeah well you know it's the Euro's going up you you watch the news
yeah and she goes well Mark if it's making that much money leave it and do it leave and he's like
are you sure and she's like yeah absolutely yeah fine so he gets to keep the money he says she
showed up like two or three weeks later and gave him a check for like 20 grand or 30 grand put it in
there additional oh by the way put this in the Euro fund yeah wow I remember he that's the one where
he told me I don't know if I have in the synopsis the one you read on the website but I have it in
the book where he said he goes I remember at the time he goes I didn't even need the money
but I took it anyway he said because you know I mean he said I mean you're gonna turn down a check
yeah he said you know I needed you know I didn't need it at the time but you know at that point he
said it was you know it was at this point he was on a slippery slope and he knew it wasn't going to
end well so he was just oh yeah he's he's um and what happens right about this time is uh Bernie
Bernie Madoff hits yeah and I remember he said the phones just started ringing people are like
where am I where's my money where are the investments where are this oh we want proof of this I want
proof of this I mean so he's in a bad spot right and at this point he's also sleeping with this girl
named um Michelle wait what was her name Kelly Kelly Baker he's sleeping with this girl named Kelly
Baker so he's got it he's has an affair with this poor chick that works at the airport I mean she's
this guy's six foot tall good looking has a plane went to NASA this guy's amazing
was in the Air Force when he was 12 or whatever he's fucking told her um you know he looks like
he's filthy rich he's buying her presents I mean she doesn't have a prayer so he sweeps her off
her feet and she knows he's married she's seen as kids you know but he puts her into her own
apartment he buys her a new car his wife finds out about it she's she flips out
what else happens but that's when when he's telling me about her that's when um
um when he we were talking about her in the in prison and one day he comes up to me and
and he doesn't realize that one of the things that the literary agent had sent in was a picture of
Kelly Baker so I have a picture of Kelly Baker this is the girl he's having an affair with
girl he's having an affair with and we talk about her yeah you know talk we talk about her
trying to think if I have the picture oh man that'd be great I know I have the picture oh nice
is that it this is Kelly Baker let me see right so she's she's cute she's a good looking girl right
yeah definitely right yeah so keep in mind in prison you're not allowed to have like dirty pictures
and you have no access to the internet you don't have anything like that well what these guys do is
they get they'll get pictures like a semi nude pictures like some girl in a thong right looking
back at you you can see the side of her breast can't no nipple but you can see you know it's like
this is close to being naked yeah she's naked you just can't certain things and so they'll order
like 10 of them and they'll have them sent in and they'll let them in because at the mail room the
women in the mail room would be like yeah you can't see a nipple yeah okay he can have these and
they'll give them and then the guys will sell them yeah well one of the guys that sells them was
a guy named um uh mark boinkin so he would get in I mean he's getting in 50 or 100 pictures
every single week and he's selling them for books of stamps or three dollars or three or four dollars
because there's no currency so you pay like four bucks for a for a picture yeah well keep in mind
that picture is there's like he got like 20 or 30 of them in whatever he got in five 10 20 I don't
know but I know that like my celly had one yeah and the guy across from us has one yeah so I've
been staring at this one picture of this girl with brown hair who's next to a pedestal sink
looking back at you in a thong it's a semi professional photo I mean it's you know it's
candid semi but it's it's over the top amazing looking this chick mm-hmm you can tell there's
lighting and oh yeah yeah right right but it looks like it's like some guy caught his girlfriend
from behind but you can tell she's too perfect everything's too perfect so I've been watching
this seeing this photo for a month or so at least and so somebody sell yeah of course there's multiples
right there's multiple copies of multiple copies so one day shrinker shows up and we've been talking
about Kelly one day I show up for one of our interviews and I said and he walks up and he goes
Matt Matt he goes you're not gonna believe this he was Kelly found out that I'm getting out of
prison soon I went really and he goes yeah he was she mailed me a letter he goes and look
she sent me this photo and he shows me the photo of the girl and you instantly know and I get the
photo and I'm like wow you are delusional you know I just go oh wow that's amazing and he takes it
and he he goes does like this to me right he was smell he goes that's Paloma Picasso
whatever that the perfume yeah you mind there's no cologne or pull on on the commissary so you
what guys will do is they'll go through books and you get the samples and rub it on there rub it on
so he must have rub Paloma Picasso on the picture and then waves it to me he goes he is that's her
scent that's Paloma Picasso that's I bought her that he is I took this photo so now so he
goes we were in Florida at some hotel and I took this photo and I was like wow and he goes he
goes can can you believe they let this through the mail room I went no no I can't believe you don't
call him out on it no because I mean what's he got I need we need to finish this story right I
need to finish this it's not the right time for that right and you know it was so over that it's
like and he wouldn't have mattered he would have spun it he would have been like are you saying that
she's a she that she's she mailed me someone else's picture no or she would have said she's a
professional or that she's she's got these on the internet or she's selling these photos that I took
you know he would say something crazy yeah and it's like what are you gonna say when someone's so
willing to be blatant about the lie there's nothing I can say so I just went okay okay it was so
pathetic too yeah so I'm like okay so let's go ahead and talk and we we keep going but so at
this point he the whole scheme's falling apart yeah when Bernie Madoff happens
everybody's calling and wanting money they want their money out yeah because they're you know they
haven't gotten any statements or the statements they got don't look right you know now they're
everybody's weird everyone's scared people start and pull money out he didn't have the money
money's just gone so one of the one of the guys comes up to him one of his uh brokers
comes up to him and says hey look I got somebody who wants some money out of this this some they
said they've got like whatever 20 grand in the Euro fund do we have a Euro fund and he goes and
shrinkers fucked up on pills and he's drunk and he goes the money's gone they're like okay well
where is it he's like it's gone he's like well I don't understand he says it's gone there's no
fund it's just gone I spent it and the guy's like oh wow and he realizes of course he already
has to know he's a liar you can't spend much time with the guy without knowing so he goes and he calls
the Indiana uh securities and exchange commission calls them tells him what happened tells him what's
going on what he thinks is going on within days they raid the office he knows there's a raid
he finds out there's a raid he and Kelly have actually flown down to Florida and they're in
Florida and Michelle knows that he's got this girlfriend she's already she's already they've
had these fights she kicked him out of the house he's living with Kelly so he uh he's down in Florida
the raid happens he flies back after the raid and he knows they're gonna indict me soon yeah they
just raided the office they just took all our computers it's it's I'm done with the same time
his stepfather dies and goes to the funeral and at the funeral he sees Michelle there they're
there together and he tells he says he says now she doesn't say this but his version is that they
were at the grave site and he tells her look I'm gonna I'm gonna fake my own death and I'm gonna
jump out of the plane and I'm gonna fake my death and you're gonna get the insurance money which by
the way the idea that he could get an 11 million dollar policy you understand people don't realize
about insurance is like if you if if Danny said hey look I want to get a million dollar life insurance
policy on me okay you have to qualify for that yeah you don't just go in and buy by the policy and say
hey how much is it oh okay it's 150 dollars a month okay cool sign me up no no it has to go
through underwriting you have to justify it to the underwriter they have to go I don't understand
this guy this guy works at tire kingdom right right he ain't worth that I'm not giving him a
million dollar life insurance even if you can pay for it it doesn't there's no justification for the
million dollar policy and it's it's it's it's weird so they don't do it there's a risk factor
there there's some actuary that's calculated who just deserves it who doesn't the guy at tire kingdom
doesn't get a million dollar policy he's making 25 000 a year yeah you have to be some somebody who's
making a couple like 150 000 a year so he says 11 million dollars right you ain't getting a you're
a stunt pilot yeah you're hooked on oxys you're not passing any of these texts yeah you know when I
got an insurance policy which was only like a hundred thousand two hundred thousand dollars
one of the things they asked was like have you ever skydived have you ever this have you
in all these questions like if you'd said yes I skydive they were going to be like yeah yeah
well you're done see you later right yeah do you race cars you know you oh yeah I race cars on the
weekend yeah okay well we're not giving you a fucking policy right right you know maybe not for
we they might give you one but not for that amount right this guy's a fucking stunt pilot he's getting
11 million dollar policy come on please yeah yeah so but he says he said that's what happened
so and and he's said it before he's said it on multiple sources where this is what happened
so I wrote down this is what happened I even though I said tell the reader I don't believe it
is there any way to prove that he got that policy no and I asked him over and over again to
let's write a letter let's find out about the policy I like to verify the policies he's like
Matt there's plenty of articles about the policy yeah yeah I don't doubt that you've been lying
about the policy right no shit but that's not enough so I have to I explain in the thing that
we had this discussion about the policy and then I personally don't believe it but it is what he said
so he tells her that and she believes him that's what he says okay and so you know
so he then goes and he says he gets like 50 pounds of of precious metals like gold
silver that sort of thing that he still has now here's the thing you're broke you're going under
but you've got 50 pounds of gold that's worth like a million dollars or half a million dollars
or whatever it was worth at that time so he goes and gets this money he then drives all the way to
like Alabama drops off a motorcycle and comes back within like 24 hours like he drives all the
way there all night drops it rents a storage unit drops off the bike comes all the way back
takes the plane and flies like he's going to visit his father his real father not the stepfather
his real father he's flies the plane and as he's flying the plane he calls in the distress signal
and he says you know my windshield has imploded ah the plane's going down
he's flying south from where um from Indiana from Indiana okay he's flying towards the Gulf of
Mexico man it's snowing it's cold yeah oh he says he's hitting turbulence there's no turbulence
I mean he's like I'm hitting turbulence on this because I've read the reports and you know the
guys are like it was a clear night and it was cold there's no turbulence you know turbulence is you
know where like hot pockets and stuff that different turbulence comes from I think mainly
from the heat from the ground right comes up especially during the day when you're flying
over the ground it's really hot out the heat shoots up and yeah so there's there's a difference in
the air pressure or thickness or something I don't know but the point is they were saying there's no
turbulence right so he's saying he's hitting turbulence and the windshield implodes man those
windshields don't implode so windshield implodes but you know the you got a pilot in danger he
and so he sets the autopilot he got his parachute on goes he opens up the door
and because it's a pressurized plane it blasts him out of the door before that didn't you say he
chewed up a handful of oxys oh yeah yeah yeah yeah he says he of course he also you know he says he
drank a bunch of he's been drinking beer he takes a bunch of oxys he crushes them up and
swallows the oxys and he um he opens the door and it blows open and it shoots out of the plane
and as he's blown out of the plane he hits the door and it catches something one of the
core it catches something on the plane and it yanks him around and he slams into the side of
the plane so now he's being dragged by the plane the plane's going up and down because of the air
because of the drag it's trying to regain altitude and so it's it's going up and down and the wind
is banging him against the side of the of the so he's caught his his strap is caught on the on
the door or something right and it's smashing him against the side of the plane right and so his
parachute opens oh but it's so the wind the velocity so you know it's so fast or whatever
the pressure they're moving so it immediately shreds it bam so it's not like it does it and
stops the plane or or or yanks him it just immediately shreds so now you've got nothing
but shreds you got nothing but these uh they called risers or something but the the strings are just
so he's thinking you know he's freezing yeah and so he's like it whatever it is 18,000 20,000 feet
the plane's going up and down up and down and it's banging him against the
the side of the airplane yeah fuselage right oh so it's banging him against the side and eventually
the strap pops and he falls with he's keep in mind he's got he says he's got 50 pounds of gold
strapped to his ankle so the the gold's dragging him down the risers are above him
he's plummeting towards earth the plane disappears i mean it's over oh by the way and this is true too
air force or the um the uh
who is it the um whatever the the tower whoever it is the air air air traffic air traffic controller
people they scramble two f-15s or f-16 they take off they take off yeah they because this is after
9 11 so they they come out of florida i think or is it texas i think it's texas i think it was texas
yeah so they come out and they go after the plane they're talking about shooting down the plane
yeah plus they have to signal all the uh commercial airlines about this right oh they had to reroute
lots of traffic everything everything and well and at the point in your story where you're
saying that he he gets sucked out of the plane um and starts getting banged against the side of
the airplane um did he mention that the oxys were like kicking in at that point so he was like wasn't
bad oh yeah that's like yeah wasn't that bad he's like he's like plunging and he said and he's like
you know that this is how i'm gonna die yeah and i realized this wasn't a part of my plan he goes you
know but on the upside the the oxys were kicking in so was that wasn't that bad so what was his
plan there was a silver lining yeah was the with the motorcycle what was it was that his
getaway car was he planning on landing and grabbing the bike keep in mind he was flying
along the same path so he knew i've got to jump at this point and get closer to that bike right
that way i'll land here he says kelly was waiting for him she was going to drive him i've never seen
anything by his word that kelly was what was in on the plan right but he says she was there
in her little vehicle whatever okay so he's plummeting through the air right towards the earth
with the with 50 pounds of gold strapped to his ankle yes then what he shoots through the tree line
so so there's the trees yeah he says he's coming down at a slight angle not sure how that's possible
on a cold a non-wendy cold night he's coming down an angle so he comes down and shoots through
the tree line when he shoots through the tree line the risers get caught in the trees so they
don't stop him but they they yank up on him and they slow him down when they yank up on him the
straps from the parachute yank up into him and they one of the straps severs his testicle
fuck that's what he says that's what he says right so he hits the water and he passes out
he says that there's some kind of a device in the vest that blows up okay and keeps his head
above water and he says that he was anchored to the ground by the by the gold so he says when he
wakes up he he's freezing it's freezing cold he's freezing and barely feel his fingers or anything
but he he manages to get his knife out and he cuts away the gold the gold and the parachute and he
gets to the um he ends up getting to the shore starts a fire and everything doesn't even realize
he's so fucked up on oxys doesn't even realize that his nuts ripped off been ripped off he ends up
making it to a kangaroo gas station yeah and he goes into the he goes into the into the bathroom
and looks in the mirror and realize he tells me he goes oh he said my face had scratches all over
keep in mind that i get i've got a mug shot of him that was taken three days later there's no
scratches not a scratch no scratches i understood scratches would there's no i mean you know it's
just scratches everywhere on bloods everywhere and he says when he goes to take off his his
taken off his stuff and he said there was a pain in between his legs he said he's pulls his pants
down a check he said and that's when he realizes that his nuts missing fuck just gone oxy's are
wearing off the oxy's are wearing off yeah he's in pain he's doing it he's wishing he had one
fucking more in his pocket he uh but that's when that's when in the story so i remember at that
point i'm had written that up and i was in the middle of writing the whole thing and the next
day i end up with the con men with uh at lunch at lunch uh with this guy um they called him uh
his name is andrew levinson and i'm sitting there with andrew and uh this other guy and he goes
he goes okay well they're like wait a second he lost a nut i'm like that's what he says
and they're like bro so okay look they said so you're they go what happened in the nut
yeah i'm like well i i don't know they're like did the fish eat it i'm like i don't think that
it's even true what the fish didn't eat it i don't know what happened i don't even think this is true
right and they're like and and they're like how
how elaborate is this lie and i go it's pretty elaborate he told me he has to take like a um
he has to take testosterone your injections uh he's got low low t i mean i said he's i mean
he's it's pretty i said yeah he's he went into a whole thing on it and the one guy goes well you
know what you want to be so you want to write true crime when you're when you get out of prison
right i'm like yeah and he's you you want to be like a like a reporter yeah like yeah he goes well
i mean you're gonna have to take him in to the bathroom and tell him to go in the bathroom and
prove it pulls nut out let's say take a look tell him to spread it out like a bat wing and see if
this thing where is this little fella is it there if it's missing i'm like i'm not going there right
doing that so uh but yeah he uh the guy's just insane so he he listened by this point oh so the
airplane by the way like you got the f-15 circling the airplane because they they they can't they can't
go slow enough they they have to go too really fast yeah so they're circling the plane like this
they're going by and slowing down and going by and they can see there's nobody in the plane
yeah this is when this is before it's crashed before it's crashed they can see the doors unlocked
so it's headed out over the gulf well then it loses altitude it runs out of gas
to because of the drag it doesn't go out make it over the gulf 50 miles or 100 miles like he had
calculated it loses it's burned off all of its fuel early it loses altitude crashes into a like a
swampy area the wings get ripped off the tail gets ripped off this thing is shredded i mean it's
nothing but a haul and when the police get there they track it down the one thing that is not destroyed
is the window that he had said the windshield that he had said had imploded right which is the reason
for the whole crash and in the first place parachutes missing they find a campground they find like a
guide to koa campgrounds which is where he ultimately ends up going and they find him there yeah i mean
it's just he's just a trail of evidence wow just pure stupidity yeah and he's not stupid he's just
got some issues yeah so that's putting it lately yeah he's thinking it's gonna go out hit the hit the
water and sink sink and then when it hits the water the windshield will get blown out yeah so
yeah it doesn't happen they realize right away there's something's not right so they're searching
for them they start looking for them it hits cnn it hits every every place he ends up picks up his
motorcycle he says kelly's there he tells kelly to kick rocks like you know like what what happens
is he says that kelly when he gets in the in her truck and she's ready to take off he says
she goes where's the gold and he goes i had to cut it loose and she's like whoa so you don't have
the million dollars in gold or 1.5 million or whatever it's worth you don't have it and he's
like no i was drowning me i had to cut it loose and she's like it's ironic yeah he's like she i mean
she's like yeah i'm done we're we're good i gotta go let me so later nerd yeah see you yeah he's
like i mean if you want to go do you think you do you want to go do you mean she's like yeah yeah
i'm going and she takes off i've never seen anything to corroborate that that she was ever
involved in any way but so anyway he gets on his motorcycle he takes off he goes to the camp rounds
and tried to tell me he was trying to drive to the to the accident site to turn himself in or
tell me but he's so cold he had to turn he to go and he went ahead and he had his camping gear so he
had to go ahead and just pulled into this camp round and so he stays there and the next day overnight
he realizes he's the next morning he sees the stuff on the on the the media that they're covering it
and that he's they're looking for him they found the plane he knows he's straight he knows he's
fucked yeah it's over i'm done so he starts thinking i remember he told me this
and everything i had read about narcissists pathological liars the whole thing thing is that
they don't kill themselves you see i mean they're their ego won't let them kill right right
he's not gonna he's just not gonna be able to to to do that yeah he tells me i remember he tells me
that's when i started i was in the tent and i started thinking about suicide
and i went you were thinking about committing suicide and he goes no no no not committing
suicide started thinking about suicide and thinking that attempting right if i if people
thought i had tried to to commit suicide they would have sympathy for me and i might get a
lighter prison sentence or maybe be able to go to like some kind of a hospital or something
right so he's now trying to fake a suicide in place of the accident yes yes so that
to make it look like it was a failed suicide right like like yeah he did jump out yeah because he
knows that's over i can't know that i can do about that but i can make it seem like it was
you know i was having a mental breakdown or something i try to commit suicide so he actually
does cut himself and i've saw i've seen like i've read the reports and stuff in the newspaper
about how he tried to kill himself now i don't know much about scar tissue but i can tell you
right now i've had worse paper cut scars yeah i mean i i've got scars like on my fingers like
you know where i can see where they actually stitched it up this guy has a barely visible scar
he told me he cut his he told me he cut it so deep like it cut the tendons and it's just
complete bullshit i mean you cut it there was blood you saw pictures of the tent whereas he's
like covered in blood yeah but he's covered himself in blood right now he's cuts himself it's
cuts himself good okay it's a decent cut and he does believe but it's not cutting into the
tendons yeah not kill yourself yeah it's not like there's no coming back i'm gonna be dead in an hour
not not what happened it just bled a lot yeah and so he smears blood all over the place first
he first thing he does is he sends a letter to a guy he knows who's a reporter that he knows
constantly checks his email and he's assuming that this guy will immediately notify the authorities
which he does and that they'll track him back to the campground and show up so he's got this whole
thing put in in motion i'm gonna cut my wrist they'll show up here with an hour or two it'll
look like he was trying to commit suicide they'll save me and i'll have at least be able to say
that i was having a mental breakdown of some type mm-hmm so he cuts himself smears blood all over
the place waits for the police they don't he told me this whole thing about a helicopter coming down
and this whole thing nothing none of it happened like he told me this whole thing about how the
cyber they had like the cyber police tracked him back with a whole hollywood bullshit yeah the cyber
police you know ping the uh uh sorry pinging satellites to track down the that's not what
happened and first of all they couldn't track it down anyway right like they did try and figure out
where the email had been sent from and all they got was the koa router but they they used the same
routers apparently for all of them so they couldn't figure out which koa he was at yeah and they're
everywhere right so all we know is it came from a koa yeah we don't know which one so he and he said
no no they knew exactly which one they were headed there that's not what happened what happened was
you didn't pay your bill and when the campground owner showed up to say hey are you leaving are you
paying your bill shrinker had rubbed blood all over the front of the right so they call the cops so
they see the blood they go fuck and they're like oh this isn't good something's up they call the cops
and the cops are like okay well what does the guy look like he was driving a motorcycle and he's this
tall don't go near him we know who it is the us marshals are looking for him he's this escape
this or he's this pilot guy that jumped out of the plane they show up they surround the tent
they go in they grab them they drag them out they handcuff them they throw them on a helicopter and
they fly them in and shrinkers like and they save my life and your life wasn't in that much danger
yeah yeah and so then of course he says oh i was trying to commit suicide i was trying but he
wasn't coming trying to commit suicide that's one of those things that the newspapers because it's
such a dicey thing nobody wants to say it was faked are you trying to fake it so if you read
the newspapers new newspapers all say you know he's he was trying to commit suicide yeah that's
not what he told me told me wasn't trying to come this was just trying to make it look like
suicide right so he gets grabbed there now he's locked up he ends up pleading guilty he's got no
choice uh he gets 20 years in the state of uh indiana for securities fraud
in indiana you get 20 years but 10 of it suspended so he's got a 20 year sentence 10
years suspended so now he's got 10 years suspended sentence what does that mean suspended means that
we're going to give you 20 years but we're going to suspend 10 of it provided you complete the 10
years okay and you don't get in trouble right no problems no problems because let's say he
commit he commits another crime well then they can give him the other 10 but you're the other 10
year right so be on your best behavior so they also in indiana according to shrinker and i think
this is basically true because i saw that what the newspaper said he got like 20 years 10 years
suspended the whole thing so he got the 10 years that you only do like 50 percent of your time for
a nonviolent crime so now you're down to five years right well if you earn a degree while
incarcerated in the state of indiana they knock off like two years so he gets another degree all he
does is he sends he transfers all of his credits to oakland city college and he takes some environmental
class and he gets a degree in environmental studies and so he ends up getting another degree
and they knock off like another two or three years so he ends up doing like two years a couple years
yeah there's a couple years then he immediately goes to the feds one the feds he he got like 50
months 51 months right around there you do 85 percent of your time so he got there he does
85 percent of his time he got a year halfway house which is amazing this guy got a year halfway i
got nine months um but while he's there that's when he meets me and comes to me and says look
will you write my story you know i shouldn't be here it was all my wife yeah it was all
michelle did it michelle's the one that ran the ponzi scheme michelle's the one that took all that
money michelle's the one that was doing all the books i didn't know that she wasn't investing
that money keep in mind the he doesn't he didn't mind admitting well he did mind it but i convinced
him to tell me about the churning scheme with the insurance company because he wasn't charged
criminally for that he was charged criminally for the uh for the ponzi scheme so he's trying to
blame that on michelle and you know of course i looked at all the victim statements all the
victims are like i handed the check to marcus i talked to marcus on the phone nobody's saying michelle
you know i did the marcus marcus marcus now michelle was at one point there was an issue
because she had taken on a whole bunch of money at in cash a few days within a few days but that
was because she was divorcing him right so she knows she's in the process of divorcing him she's
taking a cash out of the bank because she's about to divorce him he tried to equate that to
it was all part of her plan that's part of her divorce plan not not her not your plan not her
running a ponzi scheme yeah yeah uh yeah so it's just wow so it's the story's you know outrage
and and what's so funny so when i'm done with the story i bring him the manuscript so you know
well anyway i have this manuscript right so i bring him the manuscript this is after i've written it
the whole time he thinks how long was this whole process four months okay so because keep
in mind too like most writers will tell you oh it takes so it was probably four or five months
most writers tell you it takes about a year to write a book well yeah but that's because you
have a wife and kids and you have you're not locked up 24 seven yeah yeah you're not locked up right
so if i get this stuff right you know i'm spending a couple months i'm i'm working 18 hours a day
yeah you know this is and to me this is total entertainment oh yeah right passing the time
quick right and there's nothing else to distract you're immersed in it yeah right there's nothing
to distract me there's no internet right there's no hey i'm gonna go watch my favorite program
with 150 other guys trying to watch four tv streaming and all or i don't even want to go in that
room yeah you know it's no no i'm not playing softball you know because these are the things
that the guys do i don't i don't want to learn how to play the guitar and so i i knock it out
i bring it to him i give it him the book and he reads it and it's like three days later
he comes to me one day and i go hey uh marcus did you read the book yet he's like yeah i did uh
i'm gonna talk to you later this is like lunch i know i know he's gonna be furious fucking mad
yeah he's gonna be furious yeah and i can see it in his face he's he's he didn't know what to
fucking do yeah so later that night i come to him and i i say hey uh do you got the you know the
book uh did you make any notes did you jot anything down how do you feel about it anything and he's
like you you said i was a pathological liar you made me sound like a criminal you you didn't say
anything about michelle like i don't mad i can't i can't let this get out and i went marcus what are
you talking about i i told you i mean you told me those stories you're the one that you told
them that's what you told me i know but you were supposed to be writing a story about how michelle
i was like but michelle didn't michelle didn't steal the money michelle wasn't culpable michelle
wasn't involved in your crime even if michelle knew and she was vicariously culpable in some way
which i don't think so she may have known but knowing doesn't constitute being a participant
in in the crime right so you know no and i'm like so this is what i wrote i told you you
may not be happy but you know you marked it you said i was a liar oh you're just delusional
so i say okay i'm like well man listen you know if there's any way do you see that he's like it's
all wrong it's all it's not true it's they're not it's all wrong i go whoa whoa whoa bro if i've
made some mistakes as far as the accuracy like if there are factual things that need to be changed
by all means marcus please tell me i will change those man he just he's he's just flipped out he's
just he's no absolutely no i can't have this i mean i i take the book said well then oh well
yeah well bro i said i said uh don't buy a copy yeah i said what do you want me to tell you
so i said well i mean he's like i i i said well i mean look he said i'm not going to help you get
this published i want well marcus i said i don't really need you to help me get it published i'll
get it published right so he goes and he looked at me he goes man you're just some guy he was leaving
i'm staying yeah i still had a ton of time left at that point so he goes man you're just some guy
in prison he's nobody's gonna publish anything that you write and he's and and i go well i'll
eat publish and he goes when when you get out in 20 years or whatever it was like and he was like
he just looks at me scoffs and walks off and i was like fuck it's motherfucker and he's right
he was right because i i did i did send it out i did try to get it published but i was in prison
if you're some fucking publisher and you get a letter from some prisoner you don't even open it
right so i got out and um and i decided you know what i'm gonna do first thing i did was i i put
i had written a synopsis so i've got a like a it's like a 90 000 word roughly 90 000 word book
it's about 300 pages so i've got a a book that i'd written so i turned i condensed it and i turned
it into a synopsis of which is about nine or ten thousand words and i i placed that that story on
my on my website keep in mind shrinker had been has been out for years now five six years seven
four years five six years something like that yeah probably like five years so
about four years whatever so he's been about about four years let's say so
i get out and i put it on a web on the website i got a bunch of stories on the website yeah well
at some point recently i what it's on the one it's on the website and two i was in the process of
publishing his book putting together his book and i was going to publish his book right so
i'm in the process of doing that putting it together i think okay i'll put it up on
you know on amazon and so while i'm in the process he happens to come across the website
somebody tells him about the website and that his his synopsis of his story he doesn't know that
he just he just finds a synopsis so he finds this is this is this is in uh what this is well
this one this is october 20th of this year of this year this is a few weeks ago a couple weeks ago
so a couple weeks ago first thing he does when he sees the when he sees it is he goes to inside
true crime which is you know my website and he goes inside true crime and he writes a letter
to them he doesn't realize that i i'm inside that's that's you that's my website it's going
straight to you right you know really he writes a dear inside true crime my name is marcus shrinker
and i was just notified you published a story authored by matt cox i was approached by matt
cox at colman prison um and declined speaking with him about my story the story you have published
is complete fictional completely fictional and totally made up uh also you have used copyrighted
photos in the in the publication that do not fall under fair use i own the rights to the cover photo
and it was only licensed to one entity i would expect you will do the right thing by removing
the article thank you marcus shrinker so he sends that to inside true crime all right now that was
just specifically about the cover of the well no it's about everything well a cover in the story
saying that the story's fake but the only really claim he has is a copyright claim because it doesn't
matter you wrote the story well he's also saying that i made up the story it's all complete fiction
okay that's what he's saying so he didn't realize it went to me but even if it was fiction you can
still keep a fictional story on your website there's nothing wrong with that right no but i'm
saying it's true and it is true i mean i have all the evidence okay you know so he uh then i sent
him a you know i sent him a an email back saying uh nice uh marcus nice try uh but i have all the
all the true links printouts because the printouts when you print documents
in prison they have your name and your reg number on them so i have those with his information on
them okay so i have all the true links printouts wherein you chronicle numerous stories to me
also i have all of the original documents you provided me i also have handwritten notes from
you which you provided me in addition to the above all of the photographs contained on the website
are in the public domain the law states that any and all websites are allowed to use photographs
from other websites to populate additional websites you know i'm not using those photographs to sell
anything not monetizing monetizing in a way so i put uh i'd love to see the licensing agreement
for the photos of you and michelle that's the cover one of you and michelle however i doubt you
possess it nice try marcus however you and i both know you participated in the writing of the story
with that said what's up bro i have been in contact with multiple people doing documentaries
doing documentaries as well as several magazines and podcasters i've told all of them i doubt you
would be willing to speak with them on camera however if you'd like i'd certainly uh like to
arrange it uh i'd love to hear your thoughts on the above subjects you know please feel free to
contact me and i give my my page wow all right so i send that back so he sends me this back
what when how how long did it take him to reply oh like a day the next day i'd love to see his
face i mean i matter of fact he sends it back on october 20th so like that morning that morning
he sends me the one i respond same day the same day he's this is going bing bing bing wow yeah
so he sends this one back it's pretty long but i won't read the whole it's a mr cox your story
is salacious untrue and harassing it is junk i'm glad that he was very professional about
it is gross absurd and insulting or insults good people that have served an honest life of public
service i don't know how the fuck that is okay um you are obviously a very sick man and quite
dangerous get it okay um stating that my parents abused me um publicly is an insult to them and
certainly malicious in every way you are also casting the blame of my crimes on other people
did i ever do that did i ever say that his crimes were
no never i never won right remember no never um on other people you have basically created a fictional
story and clearly the doji department of justice uh has not been properly supervising you we will
be in contact we i don't know who we is because if it was from his lawyer because he and his lawyer
his lawyer would have written right he was in the right his legal team right we will be in contact
with the department of justice tomorrow and of course your probation officer i'm also going
to print the story out and send it to your judge and let him or her know um uh what you are doing
with your life those pictures are licensed to abc not you of which is a crime give me a fucking
break okay uh on top of the other things you are doing uh we will be sending the a dmc violation
blah blah but you just yeah uh dmca uh violation notice to your provider um i just cannot understand
how you uh how your probation department is allowing you to do this kind of malicious work
stealing pictures and harassing people if you have been stealing from the federal department
or federal uh bureau of prisons then that needs to be reported as well i have never spoken i have
this and this is good i have never spoken to you about my life given you notes provided notes
and uh when you asked me to do a story i declined i told you very clearly i was not interested
in your uh your route of life okay this is not an honorable life mr cox blah blah blah
then he says something down here about victimizing i'm victimizing retired school teachers
because okay because what he's saying is um that his mother and his his real mother and his
real father are both stools teachers okay he's saying i'm victimizing it one his real father
i'd never even talk about in the in the book i talk about it but i only say good things right
he told me his stepfather was abusive he told me his mother was a drunk so he goes on and on uh
finally do not contact me further blah blah blah whatever yeah so look so the next so like a couple
days later october 23rd i'm thinking no big deal fuck him he's not going to do anything he can't
do anything i've i'd have done everything right i have documents i know right i'm good i get an email
from my probation officer which already i feel doesn't like me so i mean not that you're supposed
to be warm and fuzzy with your probation officer you know but you know it would be nice yeah so
of course it was yeah that's what you hope for right you hope for but apparently i'm difficult so
so the last time i was on federal probation i stole 11.5 million dollars and she's right so
they're not feeling it she's made it aware that's not gonna happen she's she's let me know very
clearly that ain't happening again right not on her watch yeah not on her watch so okay she says
good morning be prepared to have a conversation between one p.m and two p.m today regarding
a complaint i received from someone you spent time in prison with this is your current probation
this is my probation officer right like last week yeah this was on october 23rd this was two weeks
ago less than two weeks ago yeah no yeah yeah about two weeks ago yeah so yeah because it was a
wednesday yeah so uh then she put uh or then i put uh it needs to be closer to one because i have
a conference called with my lawyer and opposing counsel um this is for the the war dogs lawsuit
so i explained to her look it's got to be closer to what i have at two o'clock right so she put um
actually report to my office tomorrow morning at 10 at 10 a.m wow she's flexing on you yeah you
weren't gonna tell her what time yeah exactly yeah she's like look you're you're you're forgetting
who you're you're busy yeah you're not busy you're coming here so then i put no problem i'll see you
tomorrow because you know i'm terrified of her yeah so uh so the next day i go in and i see her
and i go to her and as soon as i walk in after the after having to go through the uh
metal detector and all this other stuff yeah so i go in there and i say uh hey what's up
and i walk in and she goes have a seat and she sits down she goes um so i received a complaint i
write i said she says you know what this is about i said yeah it's from marcus shrinker
and i pull out the i said she's how do you know that and i said oh he sent this to my website
and i said uh you know i have a website and she says yeah i know i've been at the website
and i said oh okay so did you read the story she says i read the story she said and several people
in this office have read the story very serious and i'm thinking so what part of this is violation
of your probation i don't understand well because what i gathered she wouldn't show me what the
complaint was even though i feel i have a right to know one of the freedom of information act
i would have to file the freedom of information act and i'm not positive that that i could still
get it because some departments are exempt and she may she could easily not she could easily say
it's still under review whatever they didn't have to give to me but based on what she said to me
she said have you ever been up to she's do you know where marcus shrinker lives and i went no
i said but i think he lives in pace uh pace uh florida which is up by the panhandle and she
goes what how do you know that why do you say that i went well because i said the email that he sent
me has the name of the company he i think he works for and it's like a landscaping type company like
probably has something to do with the environmental studies that he got right something like that
i said so it said it and i looked that up on the internet and it's up there near pace i said and
i have analytics on my website so i know that the after i received this i checked the website
and there was there somebody from pace florida has been on the has been on the website yeah
and i said so that's shrinker right and she i go so that's how i know she goes but have you
ever driven up there and i went also his father lives in the general area too remember he was flying
oh sorry he was flying from indiana to florida which is that's why he had to go through alabama
he was going to see his father which lived in that area so i said so i i assume that's where he lives
and she goes but you don't know his address i said no she was so have you ever driven up
there to see him i said no she says have you ever driven up there and seen his parents
so that made me think okay that's weird why would you think so i think in the complaint
he must have said that you were harassing him right because he says harassing
so i think he was trying probably to her he probably said like i've been harassing them
i've driven up there and harassed him so i went no that's not true and she goes okay she goes well
you've been pretty good about notifying me when you leave the jurisdiction you've gotten permission
i go yeah i said i'm not gonna do that it's one of those things is stupid you just tell some you
just tell them right they'll let you go yeah it's reasonable you can't say hey i need to go up to
i need to i need to fly out to texas because i'm i'm i'm bringing in some uh you know i'm bringing
in 15 uh keys of cocaine you can't tell him that but if it's a reasonable you know you're going to
a funeral or they're gonna let you go so i go okay and she goes yeah okay she said well what is
well you know she goes what's all this i go oh okay i said well so i pull out the thing i said
you read the the letters right and i show her the letters and we read them and she goes okay okay i
said you see where it says he never she says did he participate the story and i went yeah he did
and i said so i said let me let me explain this to you and i show her this i said this is a letter
this is something i printed out on core links and i show her see all my name my reg numbers here
in my name she was right i said anything you print out in the bureau of prisons this is what it looks
like it has all your information at the top it has all this where it's from what it is that
everything i said this is something i print out and i show her look every page has it every
small page she goes okay she says yeah i see that i see i understand that i said okay cool
so i show i said so first of all remember how he specifically said we didn't work together
and she was right i said these are all the notes that i took while i was and i show that i said
which i said let's face it i said you see the all these notes right she was right i said i couldn't
have come up with this with this by last night right and she says okay i agree i said you see
how old it is she's right okay i said he says he never worked with me she said right right right
i said okay right here this is a print out from him with his name and information on it i said right
here it says matt here is drafts 1.3 of the outline um uh i'd be curious to get your thoughts on this
i said and then he goes on to tell me a whole story that he typed up gave to me i said and she
and she looked you should see her face was like let me see that she's like huh
and she says okay so this is i said no no no no no right here chapter 1.1 draft 2 uh i was i said
here see all the hand all the notes that he made she says yeah okay i said this one matt
i can't believe i'm writing this while at purdue i fell in love with a cheerleader named uh terry
i said he tells me all about this and he where he typed this up he typed it up printed out and
gave it to me and that says his name on it that he printed it of course got right see name reg everything
marcus shrinker yeah and what's great is that he it's not like he like he addressed it to me holy
shit right right he puts your name in so he knows that's what's really funny you because when i got
them and i was like well i'm gonna show her this when i remember i pulled it out and i looked at
i was like oh my god he addressed it and it says i can't believe i'm telling you this wow same one
another one matt it is beautiful matt uh here is the write-up from the old mill experience remember
how he hides oh you didn't read the book he hides under the table and his mother's drinking and she's
screaming and how and she's there and remember how he says uh that i'm saying that i'm smearing his
mother's image and everything they use claims and so yeah yeah all that okay uh i had learned by that
time that they both in they because he also talks about his his stepfather being drunk right uh by
that time uh by the time they got to their third drink the monster in them came out then he put
my mother had between one and two or less a wonderful loving person the problem is being the
alcoholic she was that was a rare moment when she was that sober person so it goes on and on talk
about how his mother the school teacher elementary school teacher how she was a drunk and she was
so well so you showed all this to your probation officer right so what what did that and
look so i keep what happened i keep going and going yeah at some point i mean i'm like maybe 30 40
pages into it i'm like this and then remember this story you read this thing this and she's like
mr. cautious we're not going through this whole thing she's like so she realizes look all right
you're right you know like she could tell the guy's a fucking liar right so she knows so that's
that's the end of that yeah so i i say so she goes okay so what's going on i said hey he's a
fucking lying piece of garbage and wow so she's like okay so what's what's comical to me is the
only thing about it was that i thought to myself the issue i have is that the abc thing like is
that photo licensed at one point i know it was licensed by can you show us that on there right
the associated press this was a photograph that had come out from shrinker okay this is a it was
like a glamour shot that had been done by by a lexus dealer okay yeah they wanted to use him as for
like an ad or right he knows wife and the plane and they have their lexus and because they bought
just tons of lexuses apparently he thought that was like an awesome car so so you know i knew it
had been at one point it was copyrighted by the associated press so there's very possible that
it had been licensed that may be possible i don't think that shrinker owned it he never owned it
but somebody might somebody might and it may have been it may have been uh um uh it may have been
licensed to them so i thought you know it's public domain is it isn't it i could track down and figure
it out but even if i found out that that was true well then you know abc news is going to be like
okay yeah you can use it but we want you to pay us yeah so i'm like fuck that i'm not going to pay
yeah i'm not paying anybody for it for that picture so i figured okay well you know what i know
is public domain mug shots yeah so instead i redesigned the book cover with his face with his
mug shot on it which i'm sure he loves even more i'm sure so you know my whole my whole thing to
shrinker is you could have had the gq nice pretty picture on there with the pretty wife and the nice
clean plane right instead you're getting this is what you get this is what you get that's public
record wow i think that's better personally oh listen i have two more i have one another one
that's kind of like this and then i have one that where he looks like a serial killer shaved head
he's kind of bloated in fact he's terrifying looking so i've got two other covers that are coming
so this this these are the books that will be put out with the different colors okay and where so
how long till these are published and able to be purchased woman i say it's literally a click now so
you can buy them right now well no i haven't done it yet because i wanted to do this with you
right so i'll i'll give you the link and you can put the link down and people can buy the book
okay the link the links right below you want to buy this motherfucker buy it right now
definitely and i've got quotes i got quotes from like i got quotes from associated press from
you know it's yeah listen bro it's it's some good shit right well it's fucking fascinating i'll
tell you i mean it's definitely fascinating what i love is that he's now currently still
doesn't want the story out yeah and is trying to get me thrown back in jail yeah yeah and then
writes these letters that are clearly lies see this is like two weeks ago you're still lying yeah
right still we should try and get him on a conference call or something that'd be great yeah
that would be a me that would be that would because you know and you'd you'd be able to hear the whole
you know you can watch him like there's like a date line or 2020 interview with him and you know
how i kind of mock him a little bit if you watch that video you completely see him going well now
wait a minute what like they they they um confront him where they're like okay so you took the plane
out and you you jumped you got blown out of the plane and right right he was i was so dazed and
he's like you know and so you you're you're thrown out of the plane they're like she's like right right
you've been flying for several hours right right right she's and you you just happened to land
right where you had parked a bike right or stored a bike the night before and he goes i
you know i know how it looks but it really was just random it's just like so right it's a coincidence
just a coincidence please but i mean just it's like are you serious did you really think you were
going to pull the wall over these people's eyes and he's still trying to play it off right still
trying to do it still trying to do it well that's amazing the book i mean this is it's another one
these things were like man it'd be a great fucking movie it would be a great movie just like war dogs
that would be a phenomenal movie i got like i said when i was when i was reading the synopsis the
first paragraph i was picturing the the the film i was literally watching a movie it's it's and the
the whole conflict between he and i'm convincing him to tell what really happened you know and the
parallel story of just the psychology of a pathological liar yeah yeah it was just as
fascinating as his crime story yeah he's it's bizarre it's bizarre and and honestly had i not
read all those the studies and the books and um i mean i it would i would have been super frustrated
but i was so i was so enamored with just him being this it's like you're talking to somebody that
you just completely i'm like i'm everything i'm reading is you oh my god you do that oh my god
so i completely know what i'm up against and it was just bizarre to hear him say stuff that i'm
like oh my god what do you mean yeah oh my god he did the same things there was just no benefit to
it it was just it was amazing same thing here i mean i clearly he's got a benefit he's trying to
get me shut down completely right so now the book comes out and you know you you it's just going to
get worse the more you the more you squeeze you know the more slips through your fingers right
but yeah you it'd be great if you oh my god call them up and said yeah hey so we just read your book
and we were like what book yeah mark marcus if you see this podcast uh just leave a comment below
i'm sure it'll get uh upvoted enough we'll have to communicate and get you on here okay one more
thing is i've talked to a reporter for forbs that i'm supposed to talk to about writing an article
about me and shrinker and writing the book about shrinker so hopefully if that comes out by the
time this comes out you could put that link too yeah yeah definitely um and i'll definitely mention
the podcast to him cool so yeah that's awesome that'd be pretty cool yeah very cool we'll see
what happens well cool man that was super fascinating thanks again for uh coming on and
sharing another story hopefully we can do it again soon yeah because uh i love it i know everyone
