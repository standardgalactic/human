All right, Sean, thank you for coming on the podcast, man.
Hey, it's great to be here.
Thank you.
Yeah.
In sunny Seminole, Florida.
Yeah.
You came highly recommended from my friend Jack Murphy, who's been on the podcast before,
and you guys are working together on a sub-stack project called Highside.
That's correct.
You and I started this about a little more than a year ago now.
It's called the Highside.
It's on sub-stack, so the web address is thehighside.substack.com, and it's really an outlet for our investigative
reporting.
Occasionally, we'll have sort of a scoop that's very immediate, and we'll put that out, but
our general rule of thumb is that it's got to be national security related, which in
our case normally means it's either special operations or intelligence related, and it's
got to be information that our readers won't have found elsewhere in the story, because
we do ask people to pay for it, and so if we're going to ask people to pay for it, I feel
like we need to be giving them something that they can't find elsewhere.
Now, you guys report on national security, special operations, covert ops, and I know
at least for Jack, I'm not sure about you, but a lot of his sources are intelligence
people or CIA people, and he reports, and you guys both report on stuff the CIA does,
but what is your view on...
It's kind of counterintuitive, because you guys use the CIA as sources for your stories,
but it also seems like the CIA's job is to keep covert ops off the headlines, and it's
pretty well known throughout history that the Central Intelligence Agency has kept a tight
grip on mainstream media.
Well, I'm not sure that I'd go as far as agreeing with your last statement.
I've worked in journalism here in the United States since the late 80s, and I've seen
no sign that the CIA is keeping a tight grip on the media.
Now, they certainly try to keep a tight grip on as much information about their operations
as possible, getting into the media, but I don't think once it gets into reporters'
hands, there's a very limited number of steps they can take.
Now, they've certainly taken them, and Jack has experience of this with stories that
he's reported.
I haven't had as much sort of pushback from CIA, but we'll see.
We're working on a number of stories at the moment that are going to concern the CIA.
I don't mean concern in terms of worry, but are going to be about CIA operations, so we'll
see what happens.
You don't think they have a strong influence on mainstream media, like when it comes to
Fox, CNN, New York Times, these big, big outlets?
If those outlets are about to report a story that the CIA or frankly any other part of
the United States national security apparatus is worried about, I mean, typically what will
happen is the reporting team that's reporting the story goes to the CIA or to the White
House or the National Security Council or the Pentagon depends which exact organ of
national security is involved and says, hey, we're preparing a story that says A, B and
C. Do you want to comment?
If it particularly worries the government at that point, then somebody senior will get
in touch with somebody senior at the news outlet and try to sway them.
When I was at Army Times, I spent more than 20 years at Army Times, and we had that happen
a couple of times for stories that I'd written about special operations.
And usually there's a sort of a gentleman's agreement that at least in my experience that
you can come to where they lay out six or eight or 10 things that they're worried about
in the story, and the news media have all the power in this dynamic, because you've
already got the facts.
There's a First Amendment in the United States.
In other countries, they can basically stop the news organization from publishing the
story.
That can't happen in the United States.
It's up to the government then to make a strong case that national security will be harmed
or somebody's life or lives will be placed in danger.
In the cases that I was involved in, we basically published the whole story, maybe with one
or two minor tweaks that were not central to the point of the story in the first place.
Jack explained what happened to his story with the CIA conducting operations through
another agency in Ukraine, I think it was in Russia, they were conducting sabotage.
He never mentioned the name of the publication, I don't know what the name of it is, but it
was a bigger one from what I understand.
And essentially, correct me if I'm getting this wrong, but from what I understand is
the editor at the publication basically had an agreement with the deputy director of the
CIA that they had to clear the story through them.
And once Jack finished the story, he had to get it cleared by the deputy director and
they had like a three-way call and the deputy director basically said, no, this is wrong.
And they were like, Jack was like, okay, he just assumed that they were going to include
his comment.
And instead of doing that, it was like an off the record agreement to where the editors
killed the story.
Yeah, I mean, I know Jack's discussed this episode in detail on the show.
Just one thing I want to be clear on so the viewers and listeners understand, this was
not a story that we published in the high side.
This was a story that Jack published on his personal website, sort of right, basically
right as we were about to start the high side up.
So I mean, it's up to Jack to talk about, you know, the iterative details of how that
went down.
I'm not sure.
I wasn't involved in it in terms of which publication.
I didn't write the story.
Jack, I do know Jack was very frustrated with how he was dealt with at two very well-known
national publications, but beyond that, I'm a little reluctant to sort of get involved
in that fight when I don't have first-hand knowledge of any of it.
Yeah, it's just interesting the dynamic and the relationship between the intelligence
agency and mainstream, huge mainstream publications, you know, they obviously, they aren't telling
them, no, you can't publish the story, but I'm sure they have ways of massaging their
influence into these agency or into these publications, right?
We're like, you know, with these, whatever these off the record agreements are, or like
saying things like, if you publish this, you're going to be responsible for innocent
people that are going to die and all these things.
Yeah.
Generally, the arguments that they'll make are just like the one you articulated, you
know, this is going to put lives at risk.
This is going to put national security at risk.
Or the third one, which is also a strong argument if it can be backed up, which is this story
isn't true.
I mean, frankly, of the three, that's the one that if you can prove to an editor that
the story they're about to publish is in part or in total false, untrue, incorrect, mistaken.
A good editor doesn't want to have a good reporter for that matter.
No good journalist wants to have any false information out there under their name or
in their publication.
So that's, if that's an argument that they can make, that's the argument that they should
make.
More often, the argument is, hey, we're not going to say that what you're reporting is
or isn't true, which means it almost certainly is true, but we think if you publish it, it's
going to put the following individuals or the following communities at risk, or it's
going to be bad for national security.
We won't be able to do this kind of thing again, and our enemies will, that will create
a vulnerability or whatever.
That's more typical.
And it's up to the reporting team and the editors to sort of be armored against those
arguments going into it.
I mean, you shouldn't have a closed mind, but you need to sort of at least know, hey,
they're going to say that this is dangerous to national security.
We need to be prepared to counter that, and we need to understand amongst ourselves why
we think that's a weak argument.
And there are certainly things that could be published that would be damaging to national
security and or would put people at risk.
You know, I try not to do things like publish the names of CIA officers who are undercover
abroad at the moment or something.
I mean, that's a sort of a gratuitous detail that, you know, unless they are being investigated
for a serious crime or something like that or being charged with or convicted of a serious
crime or something like that, there's not really an obvious reason to do that.
I mean, that's a sort of an obvious example.
But believe me, I'm not going to pretend that there aren't a lot of people out there who
think that in our reporting in the high side, in my previous reportings for different publications
and in my books, that I haven't crossed that line repeatedly.
So, I mean, you know, what's the cliche where you stand depends on where you sit or something
where you sit.
I've probably got that wrong.
Don't shit where you eat.
No, no, that's a completely different cliche.
I mean, I'm sure you're familiar with the Twitter files that came out about a year and
a half ago.
Yes, I mean, I mean, not at a level of detail that, you know, I could recall them, but I
mean, I remember the controversy.
Communication with the people that were in charge of moderating Twitter with FBI and
CIA, suppressing that Hunter Biden laptop story, you know, all that kind of stuff, which
is kind of like a hard evidence as you can get of the agencies meddling in the media,
right?
Well, I mean, meddling in Twitter, which is probably one of the biggest social media
platforms on earth.
Yes, yeah.
You know, I mean, my understanding, and I'm on very thin ice here in terms of the facts
of that, but they were not saying to any news organization, you cannot publish this.
I think they were trying to say there isn't much truth behind this.
But like I said, there's no law in the United States that allows the government to step
in and stop the New York Times or the Washington Post or Fox News for that matter from publishing
a story, reporting a story publicly, that the government just doesn't want reported.
Right.
I mean, that's what the First Amendment is all about.
Yes.
Well, how do you navigate your sources for your stories?
Like when you approach like your recent story, for example, the one on Kenya, and you talk
to people, you interview lots of people for these stories.
Some of them are sure are, I don't know if they're active or inactive, retired CIA people.
Yeah.
But how do you know whether to trust them or not?
Well, that's a good question.
First of all, you try to get as many sources as possible.
So if three people say something happened, it's stronger than one person saying it happened.
It also depends on what the it is.
Is it plausible or implausible?
If it's plausible, excuse me, I've got a slight scratch in my head here from the headphones.
If it's a plausible thing, a sort of human nature that you probably don't feel the need
to line up half a dozen sources that all say it happened just to prove to yourself or convince
yourself that it happened.
If it's something that's wildly implausible, then just because one guy says it happened,
doesn't mean anything really.
You've got to try to find as many pieces of evidence that it happened, and that can be
documentary evidence, that can be human intelligence, if you like.
That can be human sources talking to you.
Sometimes it's not even something controversial.
A lot of the challenges in doing the sort of reporting that Jack and I do is just finding
out a mundane fact.
For instance, I'll give you a glimpse into something that I'm reporting at the moment,
which is part of a multi-part series that we're going to have come out in the next few
weeks that will take the reader from the jungles of Vietnam and Laos to the sort of scalding
heat of Khartoum in the mid-80s to the sort of covert ops in the jungles of Zaire and
Angola in the late 80s and early 90s.
One of the facts that I was trying to nail down was when were the first Stinger missiles
started to Angola's UNITA guerrilla army by the United States as part of a covert action
program to help UNITA fight the sort of nominally communist government in Angola.
I talked to people who had very close knowledge of this program, and at least one of them
was convinced that it was 88.
Another one at first thought it was in the early 90s, and two or three others said it
was 86 or maybe early 87, and the printed accounts at the time seemed to support the
86.
Dave, but I mean, you're talking to somebody who, I mean, I would be talking to a former
CIA officer who I'm, there's no controversy here, there's no, nobody's got anything to
gain by saying, oh, it was 88 versus 86, right?
It's just pure memory, and some people are convinced that it happened in 88, some people
are convinced it happened in 86, and it's not even that central to the story, but as
a reporter, I like to include as much detail as possible for my readers, because one, like
I said, they're paying for it, and I want them to get stuff that they can't get easily
in other places, but I also want those facts to be 100% accurate, so it can be very frustrating
when you're a reporter and you've got equally reliable, honest individuals telling you completely
different facts, even if the fact isn't that big of a deal, but that happens sort of again
and again in reporting.
A lot of, especially the stuff that Jack and I write about now, which is often historical
in nature, not everything is, I mean, we've had some very topical stories in the last
year or so, driven by the Hamas-Israel war and action, what's going on in Ukraine at
the moment, but when we get further back into history, I mean, another story I'm doing right
now that we've sort of got, it won't be out for a while because it's going to take a lot
of reporting, but I'm just trying to trace one individual's career, I'm trying to do
that in the other story as well that I just mentioned, but this is a slightly different
sort of story and bit more recent, and I've spoken to people who worked with the guy and
you ask him simple questions like, when did he retire?
When did he move from this organization to that organization?
And they were there at the time, and their answers are all over the page on that, so
it can be-
Trying to cover for him?
No, I don't think so.
There's always that possibility, but I think it's more that when you're looking into something
that happened 20, 25, 30 years ago, in this case, people's memories just get soft.
I mean, the human memory is, there's countless scientific studies that show that it's just
not that reliable.
Right.
We did a podcast with a guy like that recently who, it's funny, serendipitously enough, we
had the podcast schedule with this guy named Felix Rodriguez, and the day before that
podcast, we had another guy come in, Danny Sheehan, who's like a historian, he's a lawyer,
and he was involved in Iron Rancontra, he was involved in the Pentagon Papers case, Watergate,
all this stuff, and he came in and gave us all this information on Felix Rodriguez and
these anti-Castro, anti-communist Cuban exiles who were trained as assassins to assassinate
Castro, and how all of this tied back to, was it Reagan or Nixon?
I can't remember.
You remember?
No, I don't remember.
But anyways, I guess his claim was that these same Cuban exiles that were originally trained
in these triangular hit teams to take out Castro, he says the same guys were used to
kill Kennedy.
And he tells me this the day before I go to interview this guy, telling me that he was
involved in the Kennedy assassination.
That guy, Felix also has been accused of murdering a DEA agent in Mexico, Kiki Camarena.
I don't know if you're familiar with that.
I mean, I'm familiar with the murder.
I didn't realize that Felix Rodriguez had been accused in some quarter of doing that.
Yeah, there was a really good documentary that came out called The Last Nark, which was
all about that, all about the DEA guys that were in Mexico that were somehow, the guy
Kiki Camarena got caught up in what was going on in Nicaragua and the CIA's involvement
in training people in Mexico.
And the claim is in the documentary that Kiki learned too much and he had to be taken out
and then he was tortured to death basically and murdered and they claim that Felix was
the one there.
But that's neither here nor there.
When it comes to some of your reporting that you're doing right now on some of the more
topical things, the things that are happening in like Ukraine and Russia and in Israel
and Gaza, what are some of those, some of the biggest stories that you're most interested
in right now?
Well, the one that got a huge amount of attention for us drove a lot of subscriptions was Jack
did an excellent sort of deep dive, if you like, last fall into how Joint Special Operations
Command, which is the command in the US military that handles the most sensitive special operations
missions, then so-called National Mission Force, had responded to the war between Israel
and Hamas and basically had flown a massive task force over to Cyprus to stage for possible
hostage rescues and to otherwise assist the Israelis with what they were doing.
There was a lot more detail in the story, but that's the sort of story that when we
have sort of information that hasn't been reported elsewhere and we're confident that
in a competitive business, like we're in, that it's going to stay exclusive until we
hit the publish button, that we'll do that and I still think that that's in terms of
how US special operations forces have responded to the Israel-Hamas war, that's easily the
most detailed article that's come out.
In the Ukraine case, if you recall, in fact, this was one of our first articles that we
published on the high side last year, President Biden made a trip to the Ukraine and we basically
sort of combined two strands of information into a fairly lengthy story.
One was we knew that there was going to be some special operations support to a presidential
visit like that and we had some exclusive information on that, so we put that in.
What do you mean by that special operations support?
Meaning like any time that the president goes to a war zone, there's a whole series
of steps that get taken, any president and the Secret Service has a close relationship
with Delta Force from the Army and joint special operations command that Delta Force falls
under and so we wrote about the support that was being provided on that trip but we also,
we happen to know a former Secret Service officer who offered to tell us how the Secret
Service prepares for war zone trips.
We were able to give a very detailed explanation to our readers of how the Secret Service keeps
those trips secret, avoids because they're usually a secret up to the moment that the
president lands in whichever war zone it is for obvious security reasons, to avoid giving
any body who might wish ill to the United States president the time to set up an operation
to target him and so you know there were some very interesting and in some cases amusing
stories of how the Secret Service keeps those secrets sometimes just from the other Secret
Service agents who aren't read in on it and aren't part of the mission and occasionally
having to smuggle the president out of the White House and different vehicles and so
forth.
I mean that's the sort of story we'll do that I feel is value added for our readers.
We charge five dollars a month to subscribe which is, I think I'm on safe ground saying
less than a lot of Americans spend on their coffee every day so we don't publish with
extraordinary frequency but when we do publish something we're pretty confident that it's
something you won't have read elsewhere.
That's right and it'll be linked below for people that want to go check out the sub-stack
so people can go down there and check it out.
So can you give me some more details on that story with the Secret Service in Ukraine,
how Ukraine doesn't see, it seems like it's kind of chaotic right now and I know that
or at least I've read that typically when presidents go to visit countries that are
in war they work closely with that country's intelligence services.
Oh sure.
I mean...
So how would that work in Ukraine?
Well I think I'm sure that the folks that the White House and the Secret Service would
be liaising with would be the most trusted Ukrainian security force elements and they'd
have to be some, I'm not privy to this, I don't think really anybody is but there's always
been a concern with Ukraine that some of its intelligence services and it's got as we do
in the United States it's got a variety of intelligence organizations and some of them
probably more penetrated than others by the Russians.
So you've got to be careful who you're sharing information with and how closely held it's
going to be but there'd also be liaising with the US Embassy in Kiev which is obviously
still up and running and then the US military and the US Secret Service would have people
in place well ahead of the visit and we sort of run through how that has worked in the
past in previous visits to war zones in the Middle East and Africa and so forth so with
the understanding that it probably hasn't changed much in the meantime.
And when it comes to Israel and Gaza what is the like how much special operations forces
do we have on the ground there like working I know we have quite a bit but what have you
learned about what's going on there?
Well when we published our story which like I said was towards the end of last year so
I can't tell you what you know we haven't reported on what's happening in May of 2024
but JSOC Joint Special Operations Command deployed its what I understand to be its standard
sort of task force headquarters with associated elements from the special mission units like
Delta Force like SEAL Team 6 like the and you know with the sort of slices as they would
say in the military of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment and other units and they
went to Cyprus to a military air base in Cyprus to stage.
Now in terms of on the ground in Gaza I'd be surprised if there's any US military on
the ground when we were reporting the story it didn't appear to be that there were any.
Of course the US military has you know most of these organizations have liaison officers
in Israel and just as part of the normal course of business and I think you know the number
of US personnel in Israel was plus stop but at the time that we reported the story was
plus stop was increased slightly but at the time that we reported the story it didn't
appear that there were you know entire units being deployed to Israel that might have changed
I don't know but that but when we when we reported it it didn't appear to be the case.
Right but they're special operators though like like lots of like this episode of the

below now back to the show yes special operators right right and so your recent story about
the CIA extra judicial judicial killings in Kenya when when did this come about so the
killing that that that we sort of focused on was in 2012 but it was just earlier this
year that a court in Kenya found it to be an unlawful killing and it was conducted by
a Kenyan unit called the rapid response team right but that was a CIA trained and essentially
created organization so it's an organization that all of our reporting suggested did the
bidding of the CIA and why was that why was this set up by the CIA because in the in the
years after 9-11 as part of the you know the so-called global war on terror right the CIA
set up had a program it was called the counter terrorism operations program I believe it's
still going and it it basically allowed the CIA to create surrogate units proxy forces in you
know in a range of different countries the ones that we were able to identify it are listed in
the article there's one in the in fact we we couldn't even get the source to tell us which
country it was but it was in South America in the tri-border area of South America and the
other country I believe was I don't have the story in front of me I think and Jack Jack wrote it
and I sort of edited it and added some quotes from from one of my former CIA sources but it
wasn't on this topic I believe it was Thailand but I could be wrong about that maybe you can fact
check that while we're while we're on while we're on the air yeah um what should he search for to
find that um the just the the Kenyan the Kenyan story that we yeah just just type in type in Kenya
CIA high side you'll find it yeah and you I think you had it up a minute ago yeah and somewhere in
there it says that there are in addition to Kenya you know they these teams I mean we think the
teams were stood up in a good number of countries but the couple that we were able to yeah if you
click on click on that using if you've got Danny's login it's alright so okay so the CIA set up this
this rapid response team in Kenya and it was the purpose of it was counter-terrorism operations
yep and basically the you know the Horn of Africa especially Somalia has been a real focus since
9-11 you know in the years after 9-11 of of both the US military and and the intelligence community
in terms of their counter-terrorism operations there was a great concern over Alshabab the Somali
terrorist organization which and Al Qaeda right yeah well they were Al Qaeda Alshabab ended up as the
Al Qaeda sort of franchise in in Somalia oh and you know so the United States using Kenya as a sort
of a platform because the the the relations between the US and the Kenyan government are very close
and between the security forces in each country and the intelligence communities are very close the
Kenyans also have very close relationships with the British as well aren't they tight with China too
I don't think they're as tight with China as they are with the United States and UK yeah I know
that they're doing the whole Belt and Road thing the China's investing a ton of money in those
countries yeah I mean some in Djibouti certainly in the other side of Somalia but you know they
were using Kenya as a sort of a platform but also they wanted to both strengthen the Kenyan
security forces in in case this sort of Islamist trend surged south into Kenya which it started
to do mm-hmm and at the same time use Kenyan forces as you know in Somalia as you know quote
unquote peacekeepers but you know to a degree they would those were forces that were going to get
in fights with Al Shabab and all of that meant that the CIA had a sort of a from its perspective
interest in developing units in Kenya that did basically what the CIA told them to do so they
were training guys in Kenya and in the United States yes yeah they brought US guys over in
fact that the photograph that you've got on the screen there is I believe okay a couple white guys
I believe those guys I think that photograph might have been taken in the United States yeah
you can't confirm nor deny though wow so oh wow so we brought guys from Kenya over here to train
them yes yeah wow like train them at CIA like the CIA's training headquarters yeah I mean there's
there's various training facilities that they can use they can use CIA training facilities
of you know and there's obviously other you know military training facilities that are far off the
beaten track so where these guys got trained I can't immediately recall but the CIA has in addition
to its well-known farm facilities yes all the farm down in Camp Perry Virginia which is a fairly
sprawling fairly sprawling site for stories yeah but it's also got a site in in the Carolinas as
well you know and I suspect probably others you know in different parts of the of the States
so their their their essential goal was just to capture and take out as many of these terrorists
people as possible in Kenya yeah I mean that's I suppose that's that's right it was to use these
guys to to go after terrorists that the United States and or the British and or the Kenyans had
developed intelligence on to suggest you know this guy is you know an Al Qaeda guy or an Al Shabaab
guy or or what have you and in Kenya unlike you know say you know some other Western countries
I there was clearly a feeling that there would be fewer questions asked if these guys were just
killed what what ended up happening though in the case that that we wrote about was that one of the
guys that got that they did this to one of their targets turned out they turned out to be the wrong
guy they got a human source you know made a mistake led them basically to the wrong apartment they
kicked in the door of the apartment you know the guy and his wife tried to you know escape
through a bedroom window and they they kill them in there in their backyard well they didn't kill
the wife I'm sorry they they shot the husband they shot the husband and he collapsed on to the on
to the wife and she played dead so they didn't kill her but so and were these were these Kenyan
CIA proxies that did this yes okay yeah these are this was the RRT the Kenyan RRT the rapid
response team okay and and then now 12 years later they finally got awarded like some like
60 grand or something like that $60,000 yes yes which doesn't sound like an awful lot apparently
it 60 grand goes a lot further in in Kenya than it it does in in the United States but but yeah
Kenyan court declared the killing illegal and awarded the widow of roughly $60,000
hmm so is is this team is the CIA still actively working with this RRT group in Kenya right now
to my to the best of my understanding the best of our understanding yes and what in your view is
the current state of some of these terror terrorist organizations over there in the Horn
of Africa yeah you know Al Shabaab is you know seems to be still going strong I mean I haven't
reported as closely on it as you know I've I've done in the past I you know I wrote a lot about
that fight in in my book relentless strike about joint special operations command right yeah hold
here when did you publish that book this came out in 2015 in the second half of 2015
there you go a little bit higher a little bit higher there you go and it's it's it's the sort of
warts and all story of joint special operations command from its inception you know right the
way through to 2014-2015 so you're talking about the first you know 13 years of the global war
on terror but also all of the operations well you know as many of the operations that it conducted
in the 80s and 90s that I could find out about but I mean I put put two to three years of solid
reporting work into into that book so I mean and it you know it was quite controversial when it
came out there was yeah I mean there was you know almost and almost no facts in that book
have been challenged really but you know I know that in different intelligence community and
special operations libraries you know it was removed from the library because it was thought to
contain classified information the there were some of the units the special ops units were told
that the service members in those units were told you're not allowed to to own this book because
it's considered to contain classified information which of course is with those guys it's like
a waving a red flag to a bull they all went out and bought it and so what stuff in the book did
they say was highly classified specifically I mean it would it would take a long time to go
through all of that but I mean every every joint joint special operations command is an
organization that really even today the military doesn't acknowledge as being the the organization
that conducts all of these operations so my my goal in the book was so virtually everything in
some way is classified and they might argue that it's classified the the the the way that you
know you know I approached the book was to just try to imagine a reader who's interested in
current events and it is familiar that a certain slew of things happen they know that
Saddam Hussein was was captured they know before that if they you know if they were following the
course of the Iraq war in the early days that Saddam Hussein's sons were killed in a shootout
they obviously know that Osama bin Laden was was killed they'll you know they some people would
dispute that yeah they'll they'll know that certain hostage rescue operations were conducted
some successfully like sort of Captain Phillips in you know off of off of Somalia and some less
successfully and those are the tips of the joint special operations command iceberg and so I wanted
to show them the iceberg here's here's here's the history not just of the of those operations not
just of the campaigns that led to those operations and not just of the individual units that conducted
those operations but the overall headquarters that that has been running them and you know I'm I'm I
think the book has stood up pretty well you know since it was published now after 9 11 that's when is
that when the title 50 right the the assassination law came into place or the cuz I'm very fuzzy on
this but I know that before 9 11 we had people over there and like cartoon that we're stalking
bin Laden right like particularly we had a guy Billy Waugh and a couple other guys that were like
right across the street taking photos of them could have taken them out easily but we didn't
look we couldn't legally do it but after 9 11 something changed where I mean I'm sorry I didn't
mean no no ahead my understanding and I'm I am not a lawyer but title 50 is is the part of the
US code that covers the CIA and and and its intelligence operation so it's not something
that knew that that came along after 9 11 if you're going to conduct an executive action
and an op an operation as I mean you know if you're gonna ask the CIA to go and kill someone
mm-hmm there has to be a presidential finding for that if if you're asking them to do it
particularly in a non-combat zone so if you want to kill somebody in Sudan where the United
States is not at war there has to be a presidential finding signed by the president usually briefed
to the so-called gang of eight which is a sort of the top the top intelligence committee and
congressional leaders in the leaders of and and ranking members of the of the intelligence
committees in the house and the Senate and the the ranking the the you know the leader of the
house the leader of the Senate and there you know in their counterparts from the from the
opposition right and you know I'm not an expert on what Billy war went through but the way you've
laid it out to me would suggest that there wasn't a presidential finding signed saying you can go
kill Osama bin Laden if you have him in your sights but from what I'm familiar with is that
something changed after 9-11 where they implemented this executive action or this well
certainly that I mean there were all kinds of findings I suspect signed in the days and
weeks after 9-11 to allow to allow for that I mean obviously Osama bin Laden was killed in
Pakistan by US forces they were US military forces but they were operating under title 50
authorities that right they were CIA right but they were well they were they were SEAL team six
and the 160th special operations aviation regiment but they but they were for that
mission right under the authority of Leon Panetta the director of the CIA right so it could be
legal yes even though it was really a JSOC mission it was being conducted the moment that
they sort of crossed the border into Pakistan they came under the sort of title 50 authorities
mm-hmm it is super it's super interesting like how you classify a war crime right like like
traditionally it's been like in if you're in combat and you're on a battlefield or you're in
a desert and you're running around you can shoot and kill somebody but if somebody is sleeping in
their tent at night you can't go into their tent and slip their throat because it's considered a
war crime I'm not sure if that's right I'm I think if if the person into whose tent you're
slipping it's like it's a military person right I think you're allowed to do that I mean I'm you
know you might have a bunch of military lawyers calling tell you that's wrong but I mean that's
my understanding you know if the person whose throat you're slitting is a civilian and the reason
you're slitting their throat is you just want to get a kill for some reason that has been alleged
and has occurred in you know maybe not throat slitting but sort of you know a bunch of deaths
that have you know were initially categorized in Afghanistan and elsewhere as a sort of
combat deaths and then it turns out that in fact they probably weren't combat deaths and that these
were US or coalition military personnel for some sort of fairly twisted reason wanting to kill
somebody for the sake of killing them so that's that's when it becomes a war crime but but you
know generally my understanding is the you know if you're killing if you're killing a member of the
armed force with whom you're at war there's no war is the law is fairly broad about about about
whether you can kill them or not I mean you can't once you've taken them prisoner you can't kill
them if they surrender you can't kill them but you know if they're fighting you or they haven't
surrendered you know I mean there's there's not really much difference in the way that you know
the scenario that you laid out of creeping into somebody's tent and slitting their throat
there's not an awful lot of difference between that and having a you know a drone flying out of
sight of them and and zapping the building that they're in or you know sending a missile into the
car they're driving well wouldn't this throat slitting be a much better option because you
don't have collateral damage if you if you if there's a terrorist in a building and you send a
drone strike to hit it you're gonna potentially kill lots of people and I know they justify it in
ways like they rank the terrorist how high they are up and this is okay we can kill this many
civilians for this guy but and if you have you know some knuckle drag or mercenary who's gonna
who's just like thirsty for blood who you can contract for the CIA to go out and slip into
this guy's room and cut his throat and no one else gets hurt wouldn't that be a better option
well as a reporter I'm certainly not about to sit here and say it would be a good idea to get
some quote knuckle drag a mercenary thirsty for blood to go out and and and kill people I mean
I'm I'm I'm I think most Americans would hope that you know the folks that were paying you know
that our taxpayers are paying to do this are not just because the phrase thirsty for blood it sort
of implies I don't mean that in a negative way by the way I meant that in a good way because I
mean there's a lot of there's a lot of guys that are like that that just they want to be in combat
zones right or they want to be in war Billy was a perfect example of that it's it's way better than
conscripting people kids young kids or not even not even talking you don't have to go as far as
conscripting them like even just getting young kids who don't know what they want to do with their
lives they have the option of go to college get a job go join the military and it's like
eh maybe this will be fun and then they end up going over there and their brain they're
psychologically screwed for the rest of their lives instead of like the other option or the guys
that are that are drawn to that right that want that like the guys that really want to be there
and doing these things I feel like I don't know I feel like that would be a much better option
well I mean let's let's you know let's assume that you can find those people I suspect and of
course there are people who who come into the military wanting nothing more than to you know
be in the most sort of the units that are most likely to see combat and and and and you know
and they want to be quite aggressive about it the military is an enormous enterprise and even for
the combat arms elements of the army the Marine Corps the special operations community even
it's and and their equivalents in the Air Force and the and and the Navy it's it's doubtful that
you can that there are enough folks coming into the military with that mindset to fill every single
billet of those units I mean as you're probably aware I don't know whether you've talked about it
on the on the show before but I mean the military's spent the last two or three years in a recruiting
crisis right and you know there are lots of factors behind that but one of them is that only roughly
one in four of you know 18 to 25 I think year old Americans is actually qualified to join the
military from the point of view of physical fitness health and not having you know a particularly
criminal background and so forth that's that's before you start something you know dividing
that up amongst so-called you know what what the military calls propensity to serve which is you
know how how much how interested are those individuals going to be in in serving in the
military only a quarter of of the sort of the if you like the target audience for military
recruiting ads or only a quarter of the the the age group is even qualified and then you got to
find the ones who want to serve there so I think as you drill down the number of folks who to sort
of use a cliche want to get their gun on right you know in that in that in that group is fairly
small yeah especially yes I mean definitely in the younger generations right um but I do I mean I
do want to just go back to the business of yeah we were telling bloodthirsty mercenaries yes I
mean you know I mean I think the term bloodthirsty to to me and I just might have embellished
sort of implies somebody who is not very discriminating they want to see blood they want to you
know taste blood literally um and you know I think let's just say special operations guy with a
dagger let's just put it that way yeah well the the the special operations community traditionally
one of its strengths has been this episode of the podcast is brought to you by Verso have
you ever tried fasting or intermittent fasting if so you may be aware of the sizzling energy and
mental clarity that you get if you do it long enough the scientific data validating the health
benefits from fasting for weight loss is overwhelming but what doesn't get talked about
enough is the longevity benefits you get from fasting when you fast your body turns on all
its defense mechanisms to help your body hunker down to fight off illness and disease but the
problem is it takes three days of starving yourself to activate this process scientists like
David Sinclair have recently discovered molecules to help your body turn on this process without
having to fast if you've ever heard this podcast before you've heard me talk about Verso many
times and I've had world-renowned nutritional scientists like Dominic D'Agostino on the show
who is the guy who actually introduced me to Verso and I've been taking it every day for the
last three years cell being is always the first thing I take in the morning after dragging my
carcass into the kitchen which wakes me up and gives me energy I even use it for pre-workout and
clean being is the product I use every night before bed after taking clean being for some time now
I have actually noticed a huge improvement in not only my hormone regulation but my vision has
improved I know it sounds insane but this stuff actually can improve your vision my lipid regulation
has gotten better and another huge thing is all of a sudden I don't get affected by all the pollen
in the air I don't have any of these reactions and clean being has actually been scientifically
proven to alleviate these things other clinical trials have proven healthier skin less inflammation
healthier hair lipid regulation enhanced cognitive function and improved metabolism on top of that

arduous selection process making sure that the right people with the right mindset are being
selected into the community I mean there's there's countless examples in just use a Delta Force
you know as a as a as a for instance of folks who make it through the the physical and and and
psychological challenges of the so-called long walk where they you know they're you know the
candidates for Delta Force are you know taken to a forest basically in West Virginia and told
to stop you know given a spot on the map that they have to go to and went and they've got to
navigate themselves through the terrain get to that spot there's somebody else there just saying
here's your next spot and there's a while and and there's a time that they're supposed to be
meeting to get to the end but they don't know where the end is and they don't know what the
time is so it's sort of a psychological thing how do they handle that that pressure but there's
countless examples of folks who have made it through that part of the challenge that part of
the assessment and selection process and then there are psychological tests and you know and
there's a panel of senior guys in the unit and graybeards so-called you know former senior
guys in the unit who are out now assessing them and a lot of them get rejected at those stages
because they're not considered to be quite the right fit and sometimes a psychologist will say
you know they're looking for somebody who's ethical you know now look there are flaws in
every assessment there are holes in this some folks will slip through the cracks in all of these
organizations so I'm not trying to say that any assessment and selection process has worked
perfectly whether that's special forces whether that's Navy SEALs whether that's SEAL Team 6 whether
that's Delta Force the Rangers you know you can find you can find you know basically criminals
who've snuck in or developed in those communities right but but what special forces has or based
on special operations forces has as an advantage over the rest of the military and most of the
world's other militaries is that they you know they're so selective about this right and you
know when you see communities that have in the special ops world that have when you see
organizations in the special ops communities that are having an uptick of problems I would say
it's usually worth going back to the selection process and see have have they allowed the
selection process to get warped are they still selecting for the characteristics that they
should have been selecting for or thought they were selecting for right so you know I you know
I can't remember how we got onto this tangent but I mean it had to do with the blood thirsty
mercenaries slipping into tents I mean I think that the moment that a nation starts using mercenaries
particularly foreign mercenaries for operations what do you mean I was talking about like American
mercenaries well I mean in history a lot of mercenaries have been foreign right if you go
back to the European wars in the Middle Ages and so forth you know they weren't all they didn't
all automatically answer to the head of state for whom they were fighting that's why they
had to go out and that that country or that kingdom or principality had to go out and hire them to
fight for them I mean that that was the sort of the definition of a mercenary and you know I think
that you know if if you've got if a country has people fighting only for it that in other words
not not fighting for that I mean the argument with folks like the Kenyan RRT that the US
government would make and I'm sure the Kenyan government would make is that look you know yes
the United States wants Al Qaeda figure X killed but so do we so they're you know the fact we're
taking American help in terms of training and in terms of resources to help create this unit maybe
or certainly train them up and and we're taking their intelligence to target them but but they're
killing guys that the Kenyan government wants killed as well so it's good for Kenya as well
exactly but if you're taking somebody from a country that whose government has absolutely no
say in it maybe or maybe that maybe that country isn't a democracy so the people of that country
have no say in it you know it it's at least worth having a conversation about that in the United
States you know which is why you need to have you know news organizations that that cover it
right right yeah it's interesting too you know when it comes to the Russia the Russia story the
Russia Ukraine story you know how how really you know a lot of people are very critical about you
know all the military aid going to Ukraine and like what is Ukraine strategic importance to the
United States like is there really that much like I was watching an interview this morning where
this guy John Mirshimer was talking to Pierce Morgan about if Russia used a nuke would the
US retaliate and he was like he was like absolutely not he's like if the US if Russia dropped a
tactical nuke on Ukraine the US would not retaliate because the US knows as soon as they
launch a nuke towards Russia it's full-on nuclear war and and Ukraine is not worth New York City
or Los Angeles to for the United States they're not gonna the United States is not willing to give
up one of their cities to being hit by a nuke for Ukraine I can't you know I can't tell you what
a US president would or wouldn't do I suspect that in that in the sense of retaliate with a
nuclear attack on Russia from the United States that's that's certainly probably true because
we're not in yet you know we don't have a mutual defense treaty with Ukraine we don't have a
right they're not part of NATO right there are a lot of ways you can retaliate without sending
a nuclear weapon right I would be astonished if the if the Putin regime dropped a tactical
nuclear weapon on Ukraine and the United States and other countries didn't do something even you
know more drastic than what's happened so far in response to that but but you think they might
use a nuke no I don't I don't know no that's what I'm saying but but but when but when you
started out by saying he said that they wouldn't retaliate and my point was a nuke okay yeah
there's other ways that that you can retaliate you know right yeah because because you know he's
also making the claim that like the only reason the United States would use a nuke is if our
survival was being threatened and Ukraine does not dictate our survival I think I mean I think
that's probably true but I don't think I also don't think that's any great insight yeah we didn't
cover this but can you give people just like a brief background into how you got into reporting
on on wars and war journalism and all this stuff and and and I know now I don't know how much
boots on the ground stuff you do now but um just as much as I used to right right yeah I am so
thumbnail bio for me I was born in Canada to two British parents we moved back to England when I
was when I was a little boy grew up the first half of my childhood in in the UK in in southern
England the second half of my childhood in Dublin Ireland and it was while I was in living in
Dublin as a teenager as a high schooler basically I got interested in in journalism and specifically
in rock journalism and I I got a sort of a columnist slash freelance gig with a magazine called
hot press in in Dublin still going strong this would have been in the mid 80s in the early 80s
really technically 83 84 and hot press hot press yeah that's a pun in Ireland it's it's it's it's
difficult to explain a hot presses is the Irish word for what the English would call an airing
cupboard but you hardly ever even hear about airing cupboards in the United States air and
cupboard airing a i r i n g and in Ireland the word for the word press in Ireland you know it
doesn't just mean a printing press it it also means a cupboard it's it's the it's the word for
a cupboard and an airing cupboard sits across sits above the the boiler in in in a house that has
a hot water boiler okay and and it's where you put some of your laundry to to finish out drying
and fluffing up so you might put your towels there and things like that right so hot press was a
pun on a hot press like I said it's an airing cupboard in Ireland so hot press was was the
publication that was started in 77 I believe I joined in 83 and I was the heavy rock writer and so
I and and for two or three years I probably a bit longer than that depending but I covered
heavy rock for them but some of that was from the States because I got a scholarship to go to
Boston University and to study journalism at Boston University's College of Communications
and there were several professors there who got me interested in in defense journalism and
national security journalism so my initial plan had been to make a career in the rock business
somehow but you know I I got bitten by the sort of the national security bug I'd always been sort
of interested in a little bit in military history and the first time that I really did that was in
the summer of 1987 which was the summer between my junior and senior years in college I went out to
the border of Afghanistan Pakistan to specifically to the city of Peshawar in what was then called
the Northwest Frontier Province of Pakistan it's now called Haibach-Pakhtunkhwa Province and
I covered the Afghan-Mujahideen's war with the with the sort of Soviet forces in Afghanistan
from from there and that was a terrific summer I I had some real adventures I got to I spent
a part of a day drinking tea in in his compound in Miram Shah up near the Afghan border with
a guy called Jalaluddin Haqqani who was the basically the head of what later became known as
the Haqqani network of the Haqqani group and he ended at the time he was the recipient of a
certain amount of CIA largesse funneled to him as well as to many other Afghan you know
Mujahideen warlords through the Pakistan the ISI intelligence agency but he later ended up sort
of on the US Most Wanted list as did another guy I met there called Gulbadeen Haqmatya and I
actually together with an American friend of mine who was on a Fulbright scholarship went
into Afghanistan sort of as we would now say embedded in the forces of Gulbadeen Haqmatya so
we went in into a little bit into Afghanistan with those guys these guys were working with the CIA
or no well they were they they they were working with I mean they were Afghan Mujahideen so they
had their own sort of chain of command if you like we didn't see to my knowledge any CIA
operatives with them they're very you know my understanding of that war is very few CIA officers
actually went into Afghanistan okay a lot of the business of the covert aid program that
being funneled to the Mujahideen it was funneled through Pakistan's inter-services intelligence
agency and that gave Pakistan an enormous amount of leverage with the Mujahideen groups and an
enormous amount of say about who in the Mujahideen groups got what and how much they got and the
result was that they gave they gave those groups they gave the more fundamentalist
Pashtun oriented groups the most the most of largest because the ISI has always favored
the Pashtuns and the fundamentalists in in in Pakistan so I did that I you know I graduated
in 88 I Boston University had a Center for Defense Journalism which had created in the
meantime they gave me after I did six months reporting for a local paper in Boston in the
suburbs there and then I went back and got a master's degree in international relations with a focus
on national security stuff courtesy of Boston University and then I came down to Washington
looking for a job covering the military and national security and perfect job happened to
open up at at Army Times which is an independent publication that covers the US Army and I fell
into it and you know I was I was just in my element there for years I covered I had a you
know various beats but they all focused on either war fighting or or the leadership of the service
so I would go out to the training centers and embed in units that were going through training I
would go to the real-world operations you know and embed in units I was in Somalia in 92 parts
of 92 93 94 I was in Haiti in the mid 90s then into the Balkans in the mid to later 90s with
with the US peacekeeping forces there and then of course 9-11 happened and I was in you know I
spent January through May of 2002 back in Afghanistan and you know I was I was fortunate enough to be
embedded with US forces during Operation Anaconda which was the largest battle of that phase of the
of the war in Afghanistan and then I wrote my book not a good day to die which I can hold up
for us so that's that's the book that I I wrote about Operation Anaconda if you
speak Arabic I do not speak Arabic I mean no more than sort of two words okay I have friends
who are very very good at it but I am I am not I'm not an Arabic speaker so so operation
Anaconda yes that was when that was in March of 2002 March of 2002 and it was really an attempt
to seal up and and and destroy either by capturing or killing the last sort of large pocket of
Al Qaeda and associated sort of fighters that was left inside the borders of Afghanistan that
hadn't yet sort of made it across across the borders into the tribal areas of Pakistan
and it was you know I would I would say it it was a failure really it wasn't a complete failure but
a lot of a lot of the in in the sense that the the mission was to destroy that pocket of forces
that a lot of those forces got away and then there's a sort of a story within the story of
that operation which I I tell in some detail in the book about the the Takagar battle it's
sometimes called Robert's Ridge because the first casualty in in the battle was a seal called
Neil Roberts but it's a it's an it was an operation that involved JSOC the folks that I
wrote my my my next book about and it involved a sort of a JSOC task force and it was the
culmination of a really successful reconnaissance mission reconnaissance and surveillance mission
that had been undertaken by a a Delta Force Lieutenant Colonel who was in charge of a sort of
a basically of what are called advanced force operations or AFO for for the JSOC task force
and he was able to to push behind enemy lines several teams of Delta Force and SEAL Team 6
operators without the enemy realizing that it had happened and have them in the high ground over
this valley operation Anaconda happened in a valley called the Shahiqok Valley in in eastern
Afghanistan and it was a stupendous feat to get those teams in you know overland not they
deliberately avoided flying them in on helicopters because that that immediately lets the enemy
know that something's going on right you know even and I tell I tell the sort of the story in
the in the book about how once it became clear how much success that that officer his name is
Pete Blaber had had in in the in the operation then there was pressure on him to let other teams
come in and have sort of have a slice of the glory if you like and you know Blaber had spent
weeks preparing the teams that had gone in the first time and imbuing them with a sort of a
certain sort of a tactical approach and philosophy and without getting into an extraordinarily
complicated story he was he was sort of forced aside in a way and other decisions were made
that led to a SEAL team trying to insert by helicopter on top of the highest mountain in
in the valley key terrain forever for whoever could hold it but of course because it was key
terrain the enemy had already taken possession of it and they shot the the helicopter up that
tried to insert the team Roberts falls out that helicopter flies off Wow just just very badly
damaged time passes they they they try to go back and pick up Roberts they try to find him that
the original team that had dropped him off they can't find him they think he's dead or they
think they found him and he's dead but they don't really check the the they don't they don't have
the time to check the body that they think they found and and and go and do vital stats and make
sure it is who they think it is they get driven off the mountain they you know seriously wounded
in in some cases and then a cascading series of misunderstandings and poor decisions follows
that leads to another helicopter being shot down on the top of the mountain and half a platoon
of Rangers in the fighting for their lives on the top of the mountain it ends up with you know
I think seven US personnel US special operators killed an incredibly controversial episode in
recent US special operations history because one of the you know something I neglected to
mention as I gave you that very thumbnail sketch of of the events was that when the team goes back
to try and find Roberts for that first I got that slightly confused they can't find Roberts they
think they can't find him but one of the team their Air Force their Air Force attachment
you know the guy that is supposed to call in airstrikes and so forth is is shot they think
he's dead and they can't it's they're under a hellacious hail of fire they have to get off the
mountain and and they leave him behind they leave what they think is his corpse behind but later
on a predator that shows up over the mountain a predator drone drone captures a video of of a
two-person gunfight going on on the top of the mountain one individual maneuvering on another
this is at a time when no Americans are supposed to be alive on the mountain because they later
realized though they later find when they finally collect you know when they finally collect
everything off the top the mountain they find the bodies they find near Roberts his body and they
realize that he was killed very soon after after falling out of the helicopter they they realized
that almost certainly that was the Air Force operator John Chapman fighting for his life on
the top of the mountain and the if you you know if you accept that as fact then that figure keeps
fighting until seconds before the Ranger quick reaction force arrives on the mountain not
knowing that he's there but then he's he's killed very shortly before before that Ranger force
arrives and they don't know what they're coming into either I mean it was it's you know although it
was you know more than 20 years ago now it's a classic example of how you know even with all
you know a lot of people had a lot of faith in technologies that didn't that didn't work as
they were supposed to on that day you know there was because that that piece of terrain had been
quote-unquote swept by different you know overhead platforms and nobody had spotted the the
Al Qaeda position on the top of the mountain they people thought it was safer to land there than
obviously it was right so that's I mean there were two medals of honor that came out of that that
fight and you know they're very controversial I mean I wrote I wrote a very detailed account of
of the fight in the in the book I then wrote another version of it with a terrific reporter
called Chris drew in the New York Times and I I I wrote a sort of a third or fourth version of it
as a cover story for Newsweek because eventually what happened was when the Air Force tried to get
John Chapman who was posthumously awarded the a service cross the Air Force cross for for his
actions when they tried to get his actions upgraded to a medal of honor the seals who were part of
his team and who had had all signed up for him getting a service cross an Air Force cross
basically wouldn't sign the statements that were required to be signed to get his his cross
upgraded so the Air Force went that way alone and in the meantime the seals tried to well
they successfully got a medal of honor for the leader of the team that Chapman was part of that
took that went back to the mountain looking for Neil Roberts and so you ended up with dueling
narratives from the two services really about who deserves a medal of honor and why wow man
so that's you know I'm sorry we got sort of sidetracked in Afghanistan but basically for the
next ten years after 9-11 I you know I went to Afghanistan embedding with US forces in Iraq I
was embedded with 3-7 Cav for the invasion of Iraq and are you when you're embedded are you
what are you doing are you are you filming are you taking photos are you just writing I mean
these days that the the sort of 20 years younger version of me would probably be filming with
this iPhone or something okay but didn't exist back then fortunately for me because that would
have just been a lot more work I suspect I'm I'm taking notes I'm interviewing people I'm you
know I'm observing I'm you know I'm you know in the in the Iraq invasion I mean I was with the
lead one of the lead elements in in you know from the Third Infantry Division the sort of screening
and reconnaissance force of the Third Infantry Division which was you know the lead division
for the army in the in the invasion and so I mean I'm just watching the combat going on and
you're in it yeah yeah I mean you're you're you're in it I mean look I mean I don't want to make too
much of that I was in a cavalry squadron that was enormously well equipped very well trained extremely
well led so you know and had every every advantage other than knowledge of the local terrain over
the the forces that they were coming up against be that you know Iraqi Republican Guard forces or
you know like armored forces or or be that the sort of Saddam Fedain more irregular forces you
know more lightly armed so but yeah I mean it was high adventure I can't deny that that was
but it was it was sort of one of the standout memories of of my life from you know from certainly
professionally would you say Afghanistan was the most frightening place you ever were reporting in
or was uh you know maybe this I I I don't know I first of all when you're in the moment at least
for me I can't talk for other people it's not that frightening because it's super interesting and
you're just trying to you're trying to remember what you're seeing and like I said take notes
and and just focus on on it um in terms of danger probably the iraq invasion was there was a bit
more stuff but I mean look you know a a bullet can find you anywhere right I mean you know we
we were getting the position I was in in Operation Anaconda at the north end of
the Shaiqat valley was getting kind of mortared and we had pretty good cover we were in a
a sort of a wadi you know a dried up stream bed um uh but you know you could hear heavy machine gun
bullets going overhead and the occasional RPG would come in um but you never you know like like I said
if a mortar round pops down in the middle of the wadi beside you I mean that's just that's it that's
it you know that's um but sometimes that in especially as those wars went on you never
know when the most dangerous moment is when your closest shave is it might not be the bullet
that you that you can hear zipping you know five feet overhead or whatever it might be that on a
patrol through Baghdad you your Humvee that you're riding in drove six inches to the left of a pressure
plate IED or or something like that an improvised explosive device you know uh and you may never
know that you know it could be that some some Saddam Fedayeen guy in a hedge was drawing a bead up
with his AK on on your thin skinned Humvee and you know or and then switches to target somebody
else's vehicle and maybe misses them right um so you you never know I mean it uh I I've had some
great adventures I there are other reporters who have been uh in much have had much closer
shaves than I have an of tragically some of them you know haven't been close shaves I mean we've had
you know reporters and photographers killed and and wounded um and so I'm I I certainly don't want to
suggest that my experience for embedded reporters is anything out out of the ordinary I I just
always felt extraordinarily fortunate to be you know uh you know an eye-witness to history uh you
know to to be able to have that opportunity you know to be with the you know one of the first
units in the Iraq invasion and see I mean I saw a tank battle how many reporters have seen
before the before the uh uh before the uh Ukraine war I mean how many reporters have been in a
in a position to observe a tank battle especially beg your pardon one involving
U.S. U.S. forces where was the tank battle it was it was south of south of of Baghdad and
where did uh Iraq get their tanks do you know yeah they're Soviet their Soviet tanks yeah
they were Soviet designed tanks yeah I mean we just had a guy on the podcast a couple weeks ago
who is explaining to me uh he was explaining how the Soviet tanks in the Russia-Ukraine conflict
there's a big problem with them they're like the pops are are blowing off the tops of them
yeah I mean that's that's I mean I don't think that's unknown I mean you could have you could
have walked through the the um the battlefields of the Kuwait war of the of you know uh uh of of
the U.S. you know in coalition war to drive the Iraqis out of out of Kuwait in 1991 and you would
have seen t-72s looking just just like that with you know if there's enough of an explosion in the
hull it pops that that turret off and the turret just goes spinning right um so so yeah I mean that's
and they are what they are I mean the the the Soviets and you know the Russians
have always preferred quantity over quality um and they've got you know as you can see
in the the way that they've approached the Ukraine war uh you know they're willing to
expand an awful lot of human life uh for what we in the United States if it was us might view
as marginal gains yeah and they're even emptying I heard they're even emptying their prisons for
people to fight well they certainly got prisoner battalions yeah that they've created um so going
back to your your journalism in Iraq and Afghanistan I've heard I've heard the phenomena
describe and maybe you can attest to this where when people especially journalists I think I heard
a filmmaker describe this is that when you're in the middle of like a firefight or like a highly
intense battle and you're in probably the most danger you've been in in a long time or throughout
the period of the day you're so focused in on capturing the moment and fulfilling your purpose
of being there you kind of like like adrenaline kicks in and the fear of the bullet zipping
over your head or mortars going off kind of just disappears and you kind of like fall into this
this weird sort of little pocket where you're just so hyper focused on capturing these things
like capturing the moment or filming it or getting a photo or whatever it is or in your
case remembering it so you can write it down that you that the perception of fear just sort of
dissipates yeah I I mean I can't tell everybody reacts slightly differently I mean you only have
to look at um at at service members and soldiers and even you know you'll find soldiers who were in
I mean far more dangerous and lethal right combat situations than than I was ever an observer of
um and they've they've made it through you know and and many many of those and they've made it
through with apparently little to no lingering after effect psychologically and then you've
got folks who never left the base that they were stationed on the fob the forward operating base
as as they were called it during the the global warrant error and and and have PTSD somehow and
I mean I'm not I'm not trying to to diminish their PTSD or whatever my point is that everybody
reacts to risk in certain situations differently um you know so I you know I I don't know how
much adrenaline was coursing through my system at the time um you know I just I just you know and
and look again it's not like I was in a situation where everybody around me was getting shot
one of the most remarkable things about three seven calves experience in that war was the
and it it had that that cavalry squadron which is normally it sort of I can't remember but it
probably in in in the many hundreds a cavalry squadron would have been back then in a in a heavy
division um had all kinds of attachments you know engineers field artillery and and so forth that
plus did up probably into the low thousands not a single service member was killed in that
task force in the entire invasion despite you know being ambushed numerous times and on the
way up and and things going wrong um and yet you know through through dint of the factors I was
outlining earlier very well led very well trained very well equipped highly motivated um
and lucky you know you can't discount discount the the the role that fortune played I don't know
I just thought about this but I think this guy might have been um in the same part of the world
as you during the same time have you heard of a journalist by the name of Michael Hastings
yes the Rolling Stone reporter yes what do you did you're immediate but uh he's passed away now I
know yeah yeah yeah that story is pretty wild um yeah I mean I've I've have I ever I I have a feeling
he and I we certainly I don't think met downrange anyway that that that I remember I might have been
at one or two events with him but I'm trying to think I don't want to say that we never spoke
in case somebody observed us speaking but I don't have a memory of that right right and maybe you
can fill in the blanks for me here but I from what I recall he wrote a story um that he I guess he
was in Afghanistan if I'm not mistaken yeah and he was embedded there with some people and then
there was a volcano or something that made them have to stay there he well no he he you know
and look I'm I'm not an expert on Michael Hastings but I remember the episode yes he he
embedded with the entourage of General Stan McChrystal who was the coalition commander in
Afghanistan at the time and Stan McChrystal yeah who is a former who plays a big role in in this
book but as the he had been the JSOC commander before which is how he basically made his his
name as a as a general okay um but as a four star general he he was uh running the war in
Afghanistan this is him yeah and and uh he's like a mean dude yeah Hastings um had
received permission to embed as a reporting for the Rolling Stone reporting with with
McChrystal's entourage um uh while they were on a trip to Europe to do some sort of diplomatic
work I can't remember the exact reasons I know they went to Paris um and now I think McChrystal
had to give a couple of speeches and his and his whole entourage comes along with him you know
his his personal stuff okay and uh it was at the time that the Icelandic uh you know volcano in
Iceland um erupted and the ash cloud halted commercial flights or all flights above Europe
for a period of at least several days right and so as a result uh McChrystal and his entourage with
Michael Hastings were stuck together um longer than the the initial plan had been um and uh
you know there are you know accounts vary on this but you know I think I'm on solid ground saying
that the entourage grew comfortable around Hastings there may have been some
misunderstandings or differences of opinion as to what the ground rules were I wasn't there so I
can't tell you what they were um and uh the story that he wrote for Rolling Stone was um uh
uh basically had a number of politically incorrect uh uh quotes um attributed to
not by name but to members of McChrystal's staff or McChrystal and crucially McChrystal himself
none of these quotes were attributed to that that got but just his stuff his stuff but um
uh it you know one of the quotes was about you know making fun of Joe Biden when he was a vice
president uh this because this was under Obama's right um and that was that uh Obama called McChrystal
back to the White House relieved him and and they fired McChrystal over this yeah over his staff
making fun of Joe Biden well it wasn't just that I mean there were a number of quotes but I mean
I look I I'm not see if you can find those I'm not I'm not here to take sight on who is right but
right no it's just an interesting story because uh I don't know how long it was after that um
Michael Hastings died when his car was going like 120 miles an hour down the street in Los Angeles
and hit a tree and exploded and the engine went flying and and he died um
uh well it's behind a paywall but uh there you go Stanley uh McChrystal
top general fired over insults uh to Biden and the conspiracy theorists speculate that um this
general was behind Michael Hastings car getting uh taken over somehow through technology I absolutely
would not take that seriously no no I mean yeah what year was that that was like 2013-14 maybe
I'm I wonder if they would even have the technology to do that to run together in my mind yeah
but um I mean I mean that's something they could they certainly probably would have had the technology
to do uh I I just it's it's so beyond the realms of because he was it didn't he I mean I think he
said publicly that he was like scared for his life right he was scared for his own safety after
outing McChrystal because after McChrystal that was his name right McChrystal after McChrystal
got fired I thought that like he publicly stated that he was like scared for his safety I can you
find anything Steve I mean I've I've heard I know that there's a conspiracy theory out there about
it yeah I would discount it completely that's mine you know right sometimes uh you know Occam's
razor and all of that yes it's more likely that you know uh that he was just going too fast in a
fast car and lost control I mean that happens that happens unfortunately oh yeah hundreds of times
you know a day in North America probably and uh it's actually happened to the new cyber trucks
I don't know if you saw but there's a problem with the new cyber trucks where the gas pedals
getting stuck and these people are like rear-ending people going full speed yeah and in no case is
somebody twiddling a device from behind a tree to make somebody's car speak up so you know
yeah but a high rank in general like that it gets fired I mean my tinfoil hat's starting to
come out of the closet when I see that happen um so what other kind of stories are you guys
working on right now on the high side oh well um you know we've had a lot of you know I'm quite
proud of the work we've done so far I mean we um we've got a story out there on the omega teams
which is uh the is that Afghanistan uh yeah okay those are the those are the teams formed by joint
special operations command to support the CIA teams that were running afghan militias you know
doing uh you know covert action type stuff in in afghanistan um and you know of course there was um
you know those those teams have been those those militias rather have been accused of
war crimes by uh and human rights abuses by uh by certain organizations and so that
you know implicitly uh taints the military teams that are supporting them with you know with the
same brush so we we did a sort of a look at at the history of those teams but um we uh you know
we've got a story that where I I normally don't like talking too much about future stories because
I'm always worried that something's gonna fall through and then it doesn't get published and
makes me look stupid but um I'm I'm fairly confident that um you know touch word unless uh
you know and you know unless we get hit by a meteorite or something in the in the next few weeks
yeah um uh that we're gonna have a story out about it uh you know and I want to be a little
guarded about this so that we sort of keep the scoop for ourselves but it's about a um it's about
an an individual who um led an extraordinary life in both the the United States special operations
community and and the intelligence community um and still alive yes still alive um and uh
you know and uh he may you know he's being considered you know for a very high award
and so we're we want we wanted to we we sat down with this individual and um
you know we were just amazed at the stories he had to tell and so you know we decided rather than
just right about the fact that he's being considered for this award we wanted to sort of
basically write about his life and times because one of the things that we we found was not only
was was what he had done extraordinary and the way that he had
charted his career and taken advantage of so many opportunities um that came his way um
but while staying extremely humble about it um but that the places he had been assigned
and had you know was part of larger missions that were incredibly dramatic as well so we've got
I've got 32 000 words or so written on this and so we're probably gonna turn it into a
I know a six-part series or something like that um so there's still a little work to do
on that yet but but the end is in sight which will not only is that pleasing to me but it's
very pleasing to Jack who uh Jack and I like to keep Jack pleased yeah well Jack Jack and I
I think I like to think we complement each other Jack is uh you know very much you know
his his his instinct is to publish as soon as possible my instinct is is always in you know
every editor I've ever had a sort of like pull their hair out over this but my instinct is always
just sort of try to get one more interview you know dot one you know triple check one more fact
right dot every i dot every t and and so forth so gotta do it live Sean do it live so so that's uh
you know but uh you know that's that's coming up I think I don't think I'm giving anything away
too much to say jack is can you tell us the guy's name I don't want to just yet okay um the
but I don't think I'm giving anything away to say that jack is has been doing a lot of work on
Havana syndrome oh really yeah which I mean just in case some of your listeners or viewers
don't know what that is it's the um sort of mysterious ailments that have uh afflicted um
um a sort of a supposedly a large number of intelligence personnel and others
military and state department among them uh that was first at least um identified as such
when individuals in the U.S. Embassy in Havana particularly uh CIA officers assigned to the
embassy and Havana started coming down with uh with with you know strange sort of neurological
type symptoms right um and so we're you know we're doing a sort of a deep dive into some of that
has any of that been published yet or is that still in the works no that's still in the works
um oh god I want to know more about that and uh is there new is there new evidence that's coming
out in regards to the Havana syndrome's cases or um well well let's let's see what what what we
produce I don't want to I don't want to sort of um tease too much about about what's in the story
but uh I mean there has certainly has been from other uh you know I mean it's not like we're the
only publication that's looking at Havana syndrome um and we're getting some exclusive
interviews on it but um if you look at uh 60 Minutes had a fascinating expose which I think
they did in conjunction with the publication called uh The Insider which is a uh a publication
focused on Russia um but not produced in Russia um uh so yeah I mean other there's you know there
we've been working on those on those weapons for a long time too yeah so we'll we'll see what
we'll see what uh you know what transpires um and then we've got slightly further off in the
distance you know and again I'd say we've got we've got a couple of stories that if we can
nail them so by nail I don't mean if it turns out that they're true but more like if we can if we can
report them out to our level of satisfaction which is more than one person to we trust telling us
something happened um you know that they would make great movies frankly so I mean I'm uh you
know I'm already trying to uh you know I vote you know I'm already I've been focused so much on this
uh on this one individual story that uh that I was talking about um you know the the sort of the
sort of the vietnam from vietnam to Africa and beyond you know to afghanistan in the end uh
story that I've you know I haven't had the time frankly to uh to pursue uh to pursue these other
stories but we're going to pick those up and go after them aggressively um with uh you know I mean
the the thing that that holds jack and I back the most is the fact that there's only two of us
and we like I said we are not you know you'll see a lot of and I don't mean to necessarily
disparage this kind of journalism it's just a different sort of journalism but you'll see a lot
of sub stacks that are sort of it's really the the author's opinion on the news right it's like
hey this the pentagon announced this here's why I think it's a good idea a bad idea or whatever
okay that's not what we're doing we you know we're going out hearing stories that may or
things that may be in the news may not be in the news like the Havana syndrome has certainly
been in the news some of the other stuff we've written about it is not and going out and finding
that untold story and spending weeks and weeks reporting it and and then giving it to our to
our readers that's great wholesome journalism not enough of that around these days more so
podcasters like me just talking out of their ass well I mean this I tell you one of the amazing
things about about the media landscape now is it's the podcast landscape it really has
you know I can say with some confidence it's exploded in the last 10 years oh yeah absolutely
because when I was writing this book which was really from sort of 2012 and 2013 and and and
the first half of 2014 none of these podcasts existed and now I see people being interviewed
on podcasts from the units that I wrote about and and I'm thinking like wow I wouldn't even
you know I've had to go out in you know doing half the reporting I did if these guys were
getting interviewed on podcasts and now you know I mean I know that the uh that that JSOC and and
Delta Force in particular are trying to rein that in a little bit oh are they really yeah um and uh
so uh we'll see but I mean it's fascinating to me that the guys who you used to have to
you know set up elaborate procedures to to meet and talk not necessarily the same individuals
but the same type of individuals from those units and you know now they now that they're retiring
and and going straight on somebody's podcast and talking about you know what it's like to be in Delta
Force or SEAL Team 6 or whatever and my favorite thing about the whole podcasting thing the whole
podcasting revolution is that it's kind of like melted away the the gatekeepers and media
now you have people like you're talking about these retired Delta Force members who can
self-publish their own book yeah and they can go on podcasts to promote it it's a win-win for
both people like the podcaster gets a new podcast and the guy who goes in the podcast can promote
his book or or whatever he's doing now and it eliminates like the the big media enterprises
and all that stuff so it's it's definitely pushed toward you know very strongly towards like the
independent journalism and the independent media and you're seeing like a huge rise in that now
yeah i mean look i'm i'm not gonna sit here and be a hypocrite right i mean i'm right now i am the
the i guess co-editor of my own stories and the publisher of those stories albeit via via substack
but i spent most of my career you know working for i don't know what you want to call it
establishment media big media i mean uh the army times when i joined was a that family of
publications was a family owned uh company um it later got bought by the guinette corporation
which you know for a while when i was working there was a ten billion dollar corporation
and then uh they sold it and it i think it's now owned by um private equity company or something
i mean long long after i left um but uh i i'm i'm not gonna sit here and say
what some people call gatekeepers you know are necessarily bad i mean i've had my
probably reputation saved on a number of occasions by editors saying are you sure you know you want
to say why don't you know why don't we leave that out for now until we can confirm it or
something like that um uh and uh there's there's you know the first amendment allows all of these
you know uh you know it allows somebody to have a substack or uh you know just a blog
and and put out there their opinions but very few of those i mean even on substack frankly
uh are reported journalism okay there's a difference between giving your opinion on something even if
it's an opinion based on a a deep knowledge that you have and actually going out and reporting
something firsthand yes and increasingly yes you see the the balance shifting um in my view
in the united states towards a lot of people opining whether that's on substack or uh some
other blog or from a a sofa on fox news about what's going on in the world and few of people
actually going out to find out what's going on in the world and reporting it yes and when you're
doing that in you know individual you know opinions are going to vary but the organizations
that put the most money towards the reporting staff and in editing staff and have the clearest
idea of what their mission statement is to to produce as close you know as unbiased and objective
as possible a daily or weekly whatever it is report on the on the events that you know on
current events you know those are the ones that that are most reliable and are doing the most
valuable work you know um there's always a you know i mean i've i've written the odd opinion
article i mean i'm not against opinions but you got to have opinions about something and the
something has got to be factually reported by by reporters yeah and i've noticed that i've
noticed that too i mean the world we live in now is is like you said we're saturated with
millions and millions of podcasts and opinion journalists and most of these people like to your
point are are expressing opinions and views of other people that they've listened to or read
and those people most likely got their opinions from other people that they've they've talked to
or listened to or read there's so few people that actually have this first-hand experience of being
in these situations seeing these things with their own two eyes and and it's just going
more and more in that direction like so many so-called experts on so many different topics
they're only experts because they've read about these things right they haven't experienced them
firsthand like you have when you've gone overseas yeah and it's not just going over i mean sometimes
it's just a question of um you know a a bureaucratic story that's happened you know
something that's going on in the government but you've got to develop sources in the that part
of the government to find out what's going on i mean these are all skills that not everybody has
and and it takes time to develop them and it takes time to know how to edit them how to guide
those reporters and so forth i mean it's uh you know i'm i'm uh you know i i know people get very
frustrated with you know mainstream media whatever that means now but you know you'll notice that
media know that that usually fox news never gets included in that even though for most of the last
few years it's been they're absolutely exactly they're the you know they were the dominant cable
tv news network right um so well they're all corrupted by advertisers and if you have an
advertiser that's going to spend x billy amount of millions of dollars with your with your network
you're going to not report on negative things revolving involving those advertisers that's i mean
i mean that's certainly a concern i i haven't seen that happen in um in my experience i've the
the most i've seen that play out is and i think this is probably fairly common you know i've i'm
familiar with publications where let's say let i mean i i think and i again these weren't my
decisions to make so i'm i'm sort of remembering sort of as a disinterested spectator um uh you
know if we had a story about a hypothetically at army times um if you if you were reporting a story
on a increasing trend of motorcycle accidents involving soldiers you know the army is concerned
because more soldiers are dying in motorbike accidents you probably wouldn't put your yamaha
motorbike ad opposite that story right um uh but you know the kind of stuff that we're talking about
right involves the government or governments right it doesn't uh it and you know the cia doesn't take
out you know one page ads and you know at least that i'm aware of in in like the washington post
or the new york times i mean they might take small ones out these days for recruitment but
you know so yeah i don't i don't social media i don't feel like um you know i i think i think a
smart consumer of media um of certainly of news media should always be aware of potential
conflicts of interest in the media that he's i mean to give you an obvious one the washington
post my you know my hometown newspaper in up in washington dc is owned by jeff bezos okay so
you have to if you're reading a story about amazon which is um you know obviously a massive
entity in the united states and there's going to be stories virtually every week about amazon
in in a national paper like the post you have to have it in the back of your mind that hey the
the guy that owns the paper owns the organization that's being written about and to their credit
the the post always includes a line in the story saying you know amazon is you know owned by
jeff bezos who also owns the washington post or no words to that effect um you know i i'm
you know look i'm i'm not saying it doesn't happen that advertisers i i'm sure it has happened
i'm not aware of it happening at any publication where you know for any at any publication i've
worked at full time or of any um story that i've written um where an advertiser has tried to weigh
in i don't know who who that would even be um and of course it it's not really an issue with
book publishing either well i think i think it really came to light really surface it reared
its ugly head during the uh covid pandemic with like the big pharmaceutical companies and all the
reporting every day that was going on revolving involving the pandemic and basically like the
information war that was happening in the media involving that that's where i think it gets the
most i i you know i the only stories i wrote for you know i i i spent uh almost three years at
yahoo news um as the national security and uh national security and uh in sort of investigative
reporter and uh including the sort of first year or so of the pandemic and uh you know i wrote i
wrote a couple stories about you know how it was affecting the military and the and the um the the
military lab that was you know there was a military lab actually quite close to where i lived in in
suburban dc that was uh you know working to find uh uh you know a solution uh to it um
but other than that i i you know i wasn't covering big farmer and so i can't speak to those yahoo
news is a is a very credible public i mean there's a lot of really big time reporters the
legitimate reporters there it's funny that you brought up yahoo news because i had a cia
former cia officer in here one time and we were we were talking about this very top this subject
about like how to analyze truth in the media or whatever and i brought up the story from yahoo
news the famous story about um the cia plan to assassinate julie nissan i wrote that story with
with uh you know two other reporters you wrote that story yeah that that was a story that i i
worked on with um uh zack zack dorfman who brought this who was the the initiator of the story if
you like it was his story that he brought to yahoo news i helped him on it um for months and months
drafting and redrafting the story and reporting it um and then mike isikoff uh came in uh towards
the end of that process did some more really great reporting on it and um yeah so yeah that was uh
that that was that if you call that up you'll find my byline on it pull up that but yeah pull
up that that article so i brought that up to my friend who's a former cia guy and i was arguing
we were arguing about uh asanj and he was like well you're here's your first problem you're
taking new you're taking uh information from yahoo news not a very credible publication
i that not a single word of not a single sentence of that story has ever been officially disputed
can you for people that might not might not be aware of that article can you give like the
basic rundown and how that story came about and what happened with it basically the the the story
was that um uh while julian asanj was holed up in the ecuadorian embassy uh in uh in london in
in the united kingdom um uh the cia was interested in you know started to explore but partly because of
some uh sort of top down um you know you know hey what can we do about asanj uh demands um
they started spitballing ideas and uh they they they got some ways into uh studying
the plausibility and possibility of of uh assassinating asanj there it is right inside
the cia secret war plans against wiki leaks right yeah there's a bit a little problem here
it's like dorfman and shawn nailer it's not a clickable link it just goes to nothing well
that's because our computer's fucked up no it's it there's something wrong with the link that
it does this that's i i strange click the next link see if the next link works
that's weird yeah yeah i can't tell you why why um uh cia has got our computer tapped
yeah not surprised i yeah i've i've no idea what's going on there and so how did this get out
that they had these that zack zack zack is a reporter with um a terrific network of sources
he's a very very good intelligence reporter i think i think one of the best in in the country
and um you know we hope he's he's he's actually going to be uh doing some work with us on one of
those sort of longer lead time stories that i was talking about that if if it turns out to be
you know uh true might might might make a good movie um and so this is the premise of the so
but the he basically his sources told him about this and he you know i mean it you know he caught
a wind of it and he started pulling on that thread and and just collecting thread on it for a while
and then he you know he uh uh you know he had written for us for yahoo news before he wasn't a
full-time employee of yahoo news as i was at the time um but he had a good relationship with our
washington bureau chief sharon weinberger she's she's now uh the wall street journals
uh sort of national security editor in the washington bureau i believe um and
you know so he started reporting it for yahoo news and i i was as a matter of fact now i'm thinking
back to this you know i i i mentioned before we started recording that i'm always worried i'm
going to say something in the heat of the moment that turns out not to be true um i i was no longer
fully employed by yahoo news when i worked on that story with zack okay um but i was i did it as a
sort of a freelance project with him for yahoo news um so i spent you know we spent month after
month after month he and i on signal phone calls together just um just you know going through every
line me saying okay you know should we move this section should we move this paragraph
eight paragraphs up to here okay how about this line or you know i think we don't need this word
and the second sentence of this paragraph i mean just and all the time calling new sources calling
other sources back to you know double check things um so yeah it was an enormous amount of of work
that went into it i mean and and um mike pompeo who was the uh the director of cia at the time that
the events we described were taking place um was later asked about it and he sort of joked about it
like he said well as a matter of fact some of that story is even true right but he didn't say any of
it actually wasn't right at no point did he said he said most of it was some he said something like
some of it's true because he was asked about it and he said it in a joking way that might lead
the person watching to think he doesn't think the rest of it is true but what he actually did was
confirm that some of it's true and he's never denied any of any of it you know um so that yeah
the sources involved in that were were they like active people or were they all retired i mean i'll
let i'll let the sourcing in the story speak for itself you know generally um
when when you have a what what would be called in journalism a background source so that's a
source who's not on the record right um you know it's not you know uh you're not saying
danny jones said this it would be you know you know according to a highly popular
podcaster from based in florida you know or something like that you know some some phrase
that lets the reader get a sense of the type of person who's giving you the quote but without
identifying the person um and you know for for me it's always like a you know according to a
you know a retired special forces colonel or something like that and so but once you've agreed
that attribution with with the source you can't then publicly be giving other details about him
or her got it so you know i mean i'll let but when it comes to fact checking like when the editors
go to fact check a story do the editors have to get access to your sources to confirm stuff
sometimes but they're not likely to um when the editors know the report as well
they're they might say who said this they're probably not going to if you can't trust your
reporter to give you an honest act you know to honestly report what their own sources are telling
you you probably shouldn't be paying them you know i mean no no editor has the time to go through
every story that that he or she is responsible for editing and and go through every quote and
call every source i mean that's that's basically re-reporting the story um and unfortunately the
dynamics of the news business mean that there are fewer editors and especially copy editors
even at major uh establishments like the new york times now than they used to be
so there's less and less sort of work time you know available man hours if you like to
to do that sort of thing so no no they don't they'll they'll want to know maybe who said it
um or what kind of a person said it sometimes they may not want to know the source because
they don't want to have you know uh you know in case there's any significant legal blowback
uh uh you know they've plausible deniability as to the identity of the source
did you or zack get any kind of blowback on that story no i mean there was uh did you guys have to
get confirmation from any like similar to jack's other story how he had to get the deputy director
to uh sign off on it did that nothing like that no no no i mean it was like i said uh
uh zack me and and and mike isikoff a very well-known reporter in washington i think our
um you know reputations were strong enough and and you know isikoff uh was at the time
probably the senior journalist at yahoo news or one of the most senior i i mean i don't know how
you would tabulate that but um uh and and very experienced so if the three of us are
bringing a story like that to the to the table um i don't think uh the edit i mean the editors
certainly ask hard questions but they're not uh not of the same type that that um jack jack
faced in in the story you're referring to yeah it's just it's such a heavy story the idea that the
cia would have thought about or plan to murder a journalist well i mean i mean you know and
there's the other half of it right which is and then they decided not to right so i mean that's
him it's not like it happened and and and we're discussing you know so uh yeah i mean you have to
you have to also say that you know cooler heads prevailed at at at some point in in in that process
yes well shan thank you so much for your time man this has been a uh incredible conversation
where can people other than your sub-stack which i'll link below uh where can they find you get
