Without further ado, please welcome the marvelous Michael Braun.
Hello, how are you doing sir?
The Danny.
It's awesome to meet you.
Good to meet you too sir.
What an amazing life you've had.
It is from your point of view amazing, it's just the same old thing to me and the thing
I would say at this point is that people sometimes freak out over this.
You met this one, you made clothes for that one, you made art for this one, whatever.
And what I would say to you is that it's just destiny, karma working out, whatever.
I'd like to tell you how wonderful I am.
It's BS.
This is just, fell in my lap, I was born a certain way with minimal talent, just art
and all the rest of the stuff in life other than putting out the garbage, which I'm good
at, I like to brag about and I really may not be that good at garbage, but I think I'm
good at garbage, is making art.
For 33 years I made clothes for rock and rollers and wrestlers, but it just fell into
my lap, meaning I was racing ocean racing sailboats and small sailboats, dinghies that
they race in the Olympics since I'm a little kid.
Long story short, I bring an ocean racing sailboat to Florida in 1966 to race, meaning
I'm just working on the boat as a laborer kind of person.
And I dislocate my shoulder, the doctor says, don't go near a boat for a year.
In St. Petersburg, at the yacht club, living on the boat, cleaning the boat, getting it
ready for the Southern Circuit.
I'm now living with, I meet a topless dancer, she says, oh, you can come live with me.
So I'm living now with four topless dancers in St. Petersburg, just off 4 to 9th Street.
Where did you meet the topless dancers?
There was a topless club in St. Pete, and at the time this was considered like how dare
they have such a thing, you know, women walking around without tops on.
This is like, you know, the newspapers went crazy with it.
Then there was a topless club, you know, regular bands are playing pop music, it's
the places filled up with men and women, and then there's two girls without the shirts
on, dancing to each song.
One of them took a liking to me, she said I needed a place to live because I couldn't
live on the boat anymore.
And in the process, I meet a lady in the club, we start going out, her name is Tony, she's
my business partner for 33 years making clothes, and very talented with clothes and very talented
at running business, which I'm not so, meaning all the paperwork stuff and ideas behind it,
meaning she came up with an idea, this is 1966, you're making clothes, get half down.
So I'm making you a $100 pair of pants, you're giving me $50, now you're invested in it.
And macho man towards the end of us making clothes for him had a $10,000 deposit with
us, meaning we're making huge amounts of clothes, you know, I'm making an outfit a week, you
know how many weeks there are in a year for $800 to $2,500 a piece, you know, and he's
wearing them, you know, sometimes some of them outfits, there's no pictures of, I never
saw a picture, hundreds of them there's pictures of, and this is year after year after year.
But back to the beginning, Tony, my business partner had a babysitter and a three year
old son, and whatever the babysitter heard you say, he would go steal it.
So we once because we were poor, he heard us say the word flank steak or just the word
steak, I don't know what he heard, he's working in a restaurant, there's a big huge flank steak,
he wraps it up, throws it in the garbage, goes back after the place close, comes back
to the house with the steak in his hand, you know, and he goes, you know, like, look,
I got the thing, you know, and he heard us say sewing machine, meaning I had done some
show sewing before I altering my own clothes and making some things from scratch a bit.
Starting because I didn't have money always for the cool clothes that were available in
Greenwich Village in New York.
So long story short, we're playing this game, he hears the word sewing machine, he's working
now at Goodwill, he steals, even if you can put this in a sentence, the word steal and
Goodwill together, he steals from Goodwill, a sewing machine brings it back, we start
altering clothes and making clothes and fooling around.
And now we're going out each night, we're walking to a club that was on 34th Street
and 5th Avenue or between 4th and 5th Avenue North, and the people freaked out.
So this is 1968, there's no, there's only pin straight clothes, Brooks Brothers kind
of clothes, people see this stuff, they lost their minds, totally lost their minds.
Now I end up making 5 Nehru shirts, so button up with the collar and all that stuff for
a local band that's playing in this club called the Blue Room.
I sell 5 shirts for $18, I show the money to Tony, I said look, we're rich, look at
my hands, we're rich, it's almost $100, we're rich, you know, think about it.
So we were just led into that, now some months after that, moron male ego, okay you got that?
I say to Tony, clean the house, I'm going to bring back the vanilla fudge, we had a
huge hit, You Keep Me Hangin' On, which was a supreme song and they did it in a psychedelic
way, I said I'm going to bring back the fudge, they're playing on I think it's 38th Avenue
South, there's a place, what's it called Susan, where the military kind of place, building.
Like a VFW or something?
Something like that, anyway, we're military, you know it's just a big room, big room.
So I go there, I follow the drummer Carmine Apasey who was in the movie that you saw,
I follow him into the bathroom, I say I'm Michael Braun on stage clothes and I make the mistake
of saying where do you get your clothes and he said hey to Ashbury, Carnaby Street and
the village and I say well this is what we're making, what I have is way better than what
he's wearing, I mean way.
I said you want to come to our house after the gig, fine, three of the four guys came,
they bought everything that remotely fit them and that we could alter for them and then
they wear it on Ed Sullivan, which is the show, live, Sunday night, eight to nine, big
deal, all kind of rock and roll people played that gig, anyway, now the public freaks out
over the vanilla fudge, the clothes are cool, unbeknownst to me, they're on the road with
a new guitar player who's come from England named Jimmy Hendricks, okay, meaning he's
from Seattle but he was in England, now he comes to America, he's on the road with them,
this is before he explodes.
Jimmy says to Carmine, where did you get the clothes, this is one sentence, Carmine says
our friends in Florida, I didn't know we were friends, meaning we made clothes for them,
you know but we're not hanging out, not that I wouldn't, but I'm just saying he says our
friends in Florida, I go to see a record producer on First Avenue South, almost the 66th street,
a guy named Phil Guernhardt who produced Abraham Martin and John, Snoopy versus the
Red Baron and Stay by Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs, these are three huge records,
I take all the clothes, I go to his office, small office whatever and I show him the clothes
and he says to me, listen, I'll tell Jimmy about you but I'm not going to push you on
to Jimmy, I don't want to upset him before the gig, he's an emotional guy, you know it's
nothing to me, I'm not getting anything out of this, so you call me Sunday afternoon four
o'clock, Sunday afternoon comes, it's four o'clock, I dial his number, he picks up the
phone, he says Michael you're not going to believe this, Jimmy gets off the plane and
says where are the clothes people, okay, so all I'm saying to you is that you could
say you know in the language of our time they'd say oh you were in the right place at the
right time or you know this is just luck or whatever, this is destiny working out, this
is just insanity, crazy, now we end up making clothes for Jimmy and back to the beginning
of what I was trying to say and that is that so you have this person that has a little
bit of creative talent for clothes, for art, for two-dimensional art, but that's where
his brain is, if you say to him, listen I need you to be my lawyer, I committed this
murder, here's a million dollars in cash, yes I'm going to take your money, they're
going to hang you, I got no ability to argue whatsoever, you know, I mean none, so all
I'm saying to you I'm accepting how the game is going because I'm forced into it.
So you designing and making clothing, is this more of a thing that you're doing just to
make money and survive or is this more of like a passion?
Both, both, the survive thing where all carry some kind of a survival mentality with us
as humans and me hearing that my people were killed a lot in Europe and that my grandmother
walked a year and a half before 1910, like around 1905, trying to get to America so that
she could be free of the hate vibe, whatever the hate vibe was, whatever, I mean I don't
know the blow by blow because these people didn't talk about it, but a man that lived
across the street from me for a while in Tampa right near the stadium shows me a picture
of a raft and in the raft is his wife, his parents, his two kids and a dog and a little
motor, I mean this is not, this raft is maybe twice as big as this table maybe and I'm telling
you I'm a sailor, I wouldn't go across a pool that's 10 feet long that's 6 inches deep in
this thing and he comes from Cuba to America because he's looking to save his, the lives
of his family and make them better, I mean he's driven by this, so I want to eat lunch
and dinner at least, so I'm working, I need to make money, but I have a natural ability
to make crazy stuff that people love, so I put those two things together, I mean it's
how I'm born, meaning I'm built that way, this is not, I wasn't like killing myself
to like get my head into it, my head was into it and the thing of making the clothes takes
up your whole brain meaning you're having to learn about how to make patterns, how to
buy cloth, how cloth drapes, how cloth sows, now you're into sewing machines, now you're
into buttonhole machines and embroidery machines and serging machines and how to keep them running
and where to buy them and each one of these things is a thing unto itself that could really
fill up your brain and now at 78 years old and I didn't make clothes, I stopped making
clothes in 2001, I walk into a room, I look at somebody and I could tell you what the
pattern looks like, I could draw the pattern for whatever it is they're wearing, I don't
care what it is, man, woman, dog, doesn't matter, I could draw it, I could tell you what machines
were used, I could tell you why this fabric that died didn't stay in it, the way it was
washed, all that crap, it's meaningless, meaning why I'm even thinking about it, I could tell
you how braziers are made, panties are made, stuff that you're going, Mike, you got some
other place to put your mind, meaning this is just craziness but it's the mechanics of
doing that thing, the same with computers, I'm painting art in a computer and I'm making
small pieces and huge pieces and none of it looks like anything that you know, meaning
I'm not drawing palm trees, abstract stuff, it's abstract and people die over it and say
how did you get this and they say how did you go from making clothes to doing this abstract
art, you know and I'm saying it's the same thing, I'm painting a human on a stage with
patterns, fabric, sewing machine, whatever, it's what I'm doing, this is the exact same
thing except no one's saying to me I got Madison Square Garden in a week and a half and it's
got to be blue and it can't be more than $2,000 or $1,000 or whatever or Jimmy is saying
to me in a letter anything you come across don't be hesitant to make something anything
to your fancy as long as it's specially made as art period, that's in the middle of the
letter, especially made as art, what do you mean by that, I talked to him you know what
he's talking to this is two humans communicating in English but he's got his version of English
how he calls things I made a shirt for him and it's in Life Magazine where I use three
squares of Velcro in the letter he says try to match the color of the sticky type buttons
to the color of the shirt or as close as possible in the meantime Velcro just came out he never
heard the word Velcro for sure it just came out then they only made it in white but he
called it sticky type buttons what you and I have on our heads he calls them ear goggles
that's just how he talks you understand what I'm saying really call them ear goggles really
wow could I make this up I guess not amazing so what I'm saying to you is that he knew by
seeing the clothes that we showed him in the beginning then we made him clothes now we're
making clothes for him every three to four months I'm sending him a whole wardrobe shirts pants
jackets scarves arm bands now he's writing me letters to this letter to say I need more of
this I need one and more unusual sleeves so at one point this episode of the podcast is
brought to you by blue blocks for a long time I've had trouble sleeping through the night and I
literally tried everything from supplements smoking pot meditating and at the end of the day all that
stuff was was just a band-aid blue blocks actually fix this problem for me with their super high
tech lenses blue light from our phones and computers actually damage our eyes and lead to
digital eye strain you get symptoms like blurred vision headaches and the worst of all you can't
fucking sleep unlike other blue light glasses blue blocks are backed by science and they're made
in an optical laboratory in Australia most other blue light blocking companies are mass
producing their shit in China with no understanding of how light impacts health they have over 40
frames that come in prescription non-prescription and even readers I keep mine literally right next
to my computer all day every day I even use them on some of the podcast the podcast I do late at
night I always use these you can actually wear these things and not like a friggin geek do I look
cute get your energy back sleep better and block out all that unhealthy blue light with blue blocks
get 20% off by going to blue blocks comm slash concrete BLU BLOX comm slash KON CRETE for 20%
off or just use the code concrete at checkout he shows me we're in a Sheridan hotel downtown Tampa
it's towards the beginning and he shows me a sleeve that instead of being small it's maybe this big
you know Mike he's not playing with the full deck the poor thing so how does he cut it you're
talking about yourself yes okay how does he cut it he cuts it from the armpit to way out here way
this much you'll see hundreds of pictures on the net of this and he's using and then six inch ruffles
along the edge he's buying this fabric this is silk chiffon and then all other kind of silks and
stuff but he's buying this fabric in st. Petersburg and in Tampa in the fancy ladies fabric store
he's walking in with hair out to his shoulders into a thing that only women go into men aren't
going to buy fabric to take the fabric to their seamstress to make a gown for their whatever party
that they're going to to show off so all I'm saying to you is that Jimmy he knew without any words
that I got what he was doing I'm starting to make clothes for him he's freaking out he loves it but
what does Jimmy always want more money mean nothing to him he doesn't even know what you're
talking about never heard of money mean nothing you know it's past money way past money so you
guys never discussed money never never not once never are you kidding me no he would just say
go to them and get the check or you know whatever how did you figure out how much to charge him
ah now you're into Tony Ackerman so Tony in the early days we would come up with a price
here's you know crushed velvet pants they didn't have crushed velvet in those days so we crush it
ourselves and we're doing fabric covered buttons and he's wearing these pants at woodstock okay
aqua front seam pants so the pants are tight to the knee and then if you look from the side
that it's coming down like this then it gets wider as it comes to your foot so it's going out to the
toe of your shoe and then to your heel um he sees what we're doing he just wants more um
he's he knows these people he knows Tony he knows Michael they're just about making clothes
that are cool that's the there's no thing you know I don't need you know whatever autographs or
mean nothing to me and Jimmy just as an aside says to my little Italian business partner
this is maybe 1968 or nine talking about Tony talking about Tony women are having sex with me
just to say they had sex with Jimmy Hendrix meaning I wasn't in the room when he told
of this story he's talking to her because he can talk to her as a human and he's getting something
off his chest which is a hurt and he says to her women are having sex with me just to say that
had sex with Jimmy Hendrix I'm 26 and a moron so my reaction is well if there's a problem me and the
boys can help fill in the blanks we don't want anyone's feelings to be hurt meaning it's just
stupidity then I figured it out afterwards in the years that went by and women's lib started to happen
that this is insulting to Jimmy very insulting meaning they just want a piece of him it was
stealing the clothes when he says to me in this letter dear couple I need clothes expresso send
whatever you have immediately and I'm thinking dude who the hell you think you're talking to
this is Mike I'm I just sent you a whole wardrobe who that you know what the hell's wrong with you
then Mike figures out what's going on what's going on is that the girls are stealing the clothes
that's number one number two he's splitting the clothes I'm using silk and rayon rayon
velvet that I'm talking about meaning this is rayon velvet so rayon rayon how do you spell that
all right why oh and you're asking the wrong person about spelling anything but that that
one I knew that's nice so yes yes yes so rayon velvet when it I'm making tight pants for a rock
and roll guy who drops his ass down to the ground holding the guitar in front of him
this rayon velvet this is meant for a proper ladies gown and a story this is not rock and
roll there's nothing rock and roll and but now we're back to the thing about that we were talking about
knowing the specifications of all these different fabrics so rayon
different colors run different ways that's number one from perspiration from washing
you know you get you you give somewhat a rayon shirt that's red you know and it's a drummer
his body's going to be red at the end of the this one's not rayon that's cotton um
anyway all I'm saying to you is that rayon at the end of its as you start to stretch it to its
the end of its life it'll just split it'll just split you'll have a foot long split in the thing
he was splitting the pants I never knew this he never says it to me ever he just says in the
letter tried to double stitch the pants right that's what he's saying right now just as an again
an aside maybe four or five years after jimmy dies
robin trower who were making clothes for a really known guitar player is playing in lakeland
I go there this is a proper english guy not into drugs you know whatever um
um very proper and cool we go there he plays we delivered some clothes anyway
he now he and I and a couple of the roadies go out for dinner after the gig one of the guys
is a guy named jerry stickles this is jimmy's roadie from the beginning the beginning and
what I'm saying to you about roadie is that this guy'll do whatever it takes to save whatever the
situation is that's going on with whoever he's working for this is the no fool around kind of
thing this is not just someone setting up the microphones this is his whole life is devoted to
let's save jimmy who just got in a car accident or did this or got caught with that you know whatever
the thing is he's the the parachute when shit goes wrong okay that's a way of saying it parachute
says it all so jerry's there with us and he says that or he tells this story that jimmy um
I forgot where I was wait a second you you are meeting them at dinner or something
yeah yeah so jerry stickles is there and he tells this story that jimmy is playing gig
in seattle that's his home it's a revolving stage jimmy drops his ass down to the ground
with his guitar in front of him splits the pants they throw him an english union jack flag
okay he ties it on him like a diaper two knots on his hip is the way I understand it I never saw
a picture of it and the gig goes on all I'm saying to you is that that's why jimmy is saying to me
try to double stitch the pants you know as the years went on I learned well you can't use this
fabric on that human being because he can split it he doesn't wear underwear right that's the that's
the legend no underwear baby no underwear oh Jesus can you imagine can you imagine that happen
can you imagine um and this is no one's gonna believe you I'm gonna tell you this thing and
you're gonna go and like you don't know what he's talking about they say well what was he like
this is quiet shy introvert very well mannered I believe it you know but everybody else says I
don't believe it that's not what I'm seeing in the music that's not what I'm hearing all I'm
saying to you is that his art as it came out of him is what you're seeing
the poetry part of it I'm just gonna talk about poetry which I know nothing about
I walk into a room he's there he says to me oh you gotta read this great poetry book some
known poetry book I'm thinking hey dude this is Mike over here what are you talking about poetry
I'm into you know being masculine you know me and I'm being silly but I'm going on what the hell
are you even talking about poetry who the hell you thinking what poetry but he was way into that
and what Bob Dylan was writing was heavy heavy heavy poetry what Jimmy's writing when he's talking
about um wind cries Mary or you know all those kind of songs where you know he's talking about
you can see happiness staggering on down the street footprints dressed in red he's telling a story
from his point of view in his mind he's talking about this and he knows that this is like very
shocking to the society meaning I'm on the phone with him once I'm calling him from New York I mean
I'm in New York with him I'm calling Tony and I'm saying what about this what about that we do our
business that we had to do at that moment and I say uh Tony sends her regards or her love or whatever
and Jimmy says tell her I'll meet her in the next world and don't be late
meaning this is Jimmy this is in his song but he's living in another place that you and I
can't imagine you get a clue of it by his music and he said this is some cool place but
back to sort of the beginning yeah talking about his personality personally some of the most talented
people that I know I've ever met have been very socially awkward and introverted like that I wouldn't
say he's socially awkward I would just say introverted quiet shy um very well mannered and
he knows how to get through a situation whatever it is meaning you know in his hotel room
in downtown Tampa in the Sheridan there's a paper bag on the you know little table there
I didn't think anything of it you know we're doing the clothes and we're taking the order and
this and that and and this is at the first time we're meeting him and I say
oh let's figure out your size try these pants on meaning I could just look at him in one second
I could tell you what size he is I give him the pants he walks over towards the bathroom
there's one of those thin tables by the bathroom and he takes off the scarves that are tied around
his waist which this is like a two-minute job meaning he's got knots of scarves going around
his waist and around his waist just what he's doing at the time is this what he's wearing yeah yeah
over his pants okay he's wearing scarves and he's tying the scarves around his knees and you know
that stuff that you see anyway he takes it off lays it on this table takes the pants goes into the
bathroom two minutes later he comes back out with his original pants on and he's got the
pants that I gave him to try on he says make them all like this meaning he's saying don't measure me
don't touch me whatever make them all like this fine
meaning he's shy and those pants fit him but these are tight pants and they're tight partially
because they're seen down the front and back and I can get away with it meaning we're getting
known for this look of these pants with the buttons down the side and all that um but all I'm saying
to you is that he could get through a situation later on that day after he played now myself you
know a few other guys and girls or whatever back at his room after the gig you know the the reefers
being rolled we're smoking it you know half an hour goes by and everyone's looking around they're
hungry you know someone takes out a piece of paper and tries to take an order you want a burger from
the whatever downstairs or fries the first person tries to do it they can't write they can't even
spell their own name meaning they're too high second person too high third person too high
finally jimmy says give me the pet he takes it he asks do you want a burger you want a medium you
want fries you want this you want a coke you want he had to have been a waiter at some point in his
life or he knew about this stuff he wasn't ashamed of it or anything like that this is what it took
to do the job he says give me the paper and he wrote writes gets the whole thing written out
they went and got the food we ate the food that was the end of that but all I'm saying to you is that
it's a very natural person and that's what's coming across when he's telling me don't be
hesitant to take and make something anything to your fancy as long as it's specially made his
art he's telling me mike go for it just go and enjoy it just go and make it don't worry about
the money don't worry about the time don't worry about jimmy hendrix don't worry about anything
just go make some art and then send it to me and make a lot um so all I'm saying to you is that this
is a lesson in life of this is just another person with all the things that you have he may have a
different set of talents and a different way of operating a little bit but and obviously a very
different destiny so far in your life anyway um but all I'm saying to you is that he knew how to
communicate on a record he knew how to communicate with some fool that's making his clothes in Tampa
you know or st. Petersburg at the time um so there's a beauty to just being natural that's
really what he was you know where a lot of us feel as though you know I can't be natural I'm not
I gotta play this part that's what the culture is telling me is proper or cool or you know whatever
right you know and what he's saying just go for it mike you know do what you do right that's why
he chose you so going back to you were shipping all of these outfits to him wherever he was it was
how many how many outfits were you making for him in a month like 50 you know no I would say
maybe 20 20 yeah and and there was and some of these women were just stealing them from him and he
had no idea no no he had an idea he knew they were stealing them um but the women would queue up
to be with him right they would you know let's say we're in the hotel we're doing clothes or we're
hanging out afterwards people are coming to the door knocking on the door I want an autograph I
want to meet Jimmy whatever you know and I got to say listen we're working you know you do what
you got to do but you only got five minutes get it done um and some of the girls you let in
particularly one girl that we let in that Susan knew the next morning she was there for five minutes
and left whatever the next morning she's there when we come meaning she had spent the night she
came after we left late and then she was there in the morning is this in Tampa this is in Tampa
and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this girl I'm just saying to you that this is
you if I say to you well here's 500 girls they all want to sleep with you you go uh that's a
little overwhelming can I have two three right you know right I mean can we stretch this out
over a week or long do I have yeah yeah but I mean and I'm saying to you and you can hear
him say it in between songs where he's saying he this is dedicated to the girl in the seventh row
with the red underwear this is the girl with the chrome uh knee pads you know you'll hear it in between
the songs on that he's talking he's just thanking people or talking to people or saying whatever's
on his mind at the moment um I'd like to thank you for the last three years he
said three things to me about the end one of which is I don't know how much longer I'm going to be
doing what I'm doing I'm going uh this sounds well what is the context of this like are you guys
this is out of nothing you guys are hanging out eating dinner where you're you're traveling with
him we're walking I think we're walking somewhere he said I don't know how much longer I'm going to
be doing what I'm doing I'm going first of all I don't like this second of all I don't know what
it really means third of all I'll do what Mike does who and Mike's not very smart he just shove
it under the carpet let's forget it I just blow it off then he says I don't know how much longer
I'm going to be needing clothes I'm going what are we talking about here what's what's going on
the third thing I forgot what it is I forgot five or ten years ago what it was he knew the end was
coming okay and he was saying it to me um and he was here in St. Pete for maybe four days just
before he died with really yeah yeah just before two weeks before he died or weeks before he died
let's say he had played the Highlight Fronton in Miami we went there we brought him back he
stayed at this this place I'm telling you the blue room which was a motel that they've just recently
torn down on 34th street but my point is is that he
knew what was coming and even though he's trying to say it to me I'm not listening to anything he
says and he's very human it's a very human person whatever that means he's staying in this hotel
he's getting up at four o'clock in the afternoon that's that's the wake up time okay so getting up
at four o'clock and we're going to eat right next to this place called the blue room in those days
was a place where you just line up to get the food um what do you call it Susan
Morrison's cafeteria so proper people in St. Petersburg this is 1970 1969 um probably 1970
so you go out and this is a proper place to go with the family with your wife
Morrison's cafeteria and you line up and you say I want that I want that you're pointing to it
and the people that got the spoons and they put it on your plate to put it on your plate and now
Jimmy's first in line I'm second Tony's there and I think Elena
the people that are spooning the fur food say to me with their mouths but not their voices
is that Jimmy Henricks you know they're pointing to him is that Jimmy Henricks like
this is Jimmy Henricks he's in Morrison's cafeteria at five o'clock like what the hell are you even
talking to how could this is impossible I mean he's very famous at this point um so all I'm saying
to you is that we go to Mars since we you know or if you go to any club anywhere with him they always
invite him to play he'll always play always always you know he may say I need this kind of guitar
or turn the amp amp around I want it to be louder you know you don't know what he'll say but
he's looking to play this is where he's living in his head in his heart or
Jimmy myself Tony and a few other people are watching a movie on television
and it's a movie about wolves that raise a baby okay it's an old old movie and we're watching it
and the wolves are raising the baby doing this whatever they're doing they might be foxes I
don't even know and so we're watching it just properly and we see we glance over to Jimmy
Jimmy's playing an air guitar in his head he's playing along with the music in this
thing in this movie this is where his head is at he's playing you know then he realizes we see
what is he's doing you know and he then he starts tuning his elbow you know I mean he makes it into
a joke but all I'm saying to you is that all of these people musician types macho man same thing
these people are totally taken up with whatever game they're playing it's a hundred percent of
their being hundred I mean macho man miss Elizabeth complained about this gorgeous George complained
about it they're there getting closed in this in our shop and this is like a
it's a huge house on south bay shore boulevard on the water six thousand square feet
and a hundred and two acres of land 150 feet from the center line of bay shore
is now servants quarters six car garage and servants quarters you're going servants quarters
even talk I never heard of this this is 1927 that's what you did you had servants and you had a place
for them to live so we're using this as our shop this is a concrete floor you know 30 foot by 30
foot room upstairs is an apartment to rent and there's long rooms on either side one room is just
a cutting room you know is a huge table very long that we're cutting fabric
um into garments on and all I'm saying to you is that the
the
playing the game with Randy all the girls complained my way of saying it he's never off ever
no he he's working all the time day and night this wears people out because they're used to
having off time he never heard of off time he doesn't even know what you mean by off time um
this is a very hard working person and the other funny thing about him
and making clothes for him is that he has no visual sense whatsoever so I'm not saying it
as an insult or a compliment or anything it's just here's a statement of fact he doesn't have this
you say to Michael can you spell Michael says no he doesn't he's not born with that you know
and can he write down a telephone number twice that probably not he's got to really look at it
very very carefully and hopefully it's an eight one three area code or seven two seven so he's
got the first three numbers but this is not his thing he he just he's not born with this he has
to really work at it to spell something or I mean Susan is tortured I have to say how do you spell
gone and so it's g o and e but it looks wrong to me I'm you know this is just something in your
head so you got something great over here you got nothing over here so you're doing the best you can
with the parts you got so Randy comes to me I got a call I'm first of all I'm not watching
wrestling I don't know about wrestling I know it's on television how let's pause for a second how far
after your relationship with Jimmy like obviously he passed away and you stopped working for him
what was it like well first of all what was it like when you found out Jimmy first passed away
with where were you and and how I was sleeping they came and woke me up and they said Jimmy's dead
so I'm new at this game I'm going what are you talking about he was just here I mean he was here
like four days we had picked him up Miami brought him back took him here took him there I mean
I'm not getting it I'm saying what do you mean he was just here you know what are you telling me
Jimmy's dead I couldn't get it um and then they said he's in England he died he overdosed or whatever
they think it was or you know he's dead then I had to try to absorb this but I had lost my
birth mother at maybe four so I was forced into learning a people die people in your family can
die this is how life goes deal with a dude and from there to this day I have maybe five mothers
meaning in my mind I think they're mothers to me you know my father married after my first mother
died a lady from Canada beautiful raised me and all that stuff in my heart she's my mother but we
had a beautiful phenomenal maid is what they call them in those days named Arlene black lady from
Brooklyn Brooklyn Dodgers fan you know so I could only love the Dodgers I loved Arlene this is my
mother meaning she took care of me I'm a little kid and a story you know I love Arlene it's nothing
even say here's words don't do it and the beauty of that is that you're learning how life goes but
you're getting what's meant for you this is a lesson you got to learn in life people can die
you can love anybody if you want to love them special we're going to tell them or they're
going to play the part of being your mother and then you get triple love or quadruple love you
know whatever the thing is I mean and there's a lady that I know to this day that lives in Texas
that's my mother she's younger than me you're going Michael what the hell is wrong with you
somebody says this is your mother they said it to me you know maybe 40 years ago I treated her that
way she's married to a friend mine you know but in my mind she's my mother if she tells me drink
echinacea tea then I'm going oh I gotta drink echinacea tea because my mother told me to you
know this is I'm just telling you this is how the mind works this is a wild thing and about Randy
he calls me on the phone I had made for a Hulk Hulk Hogan made close for him he was a
bass player in a local band in Tampa Cole Ruckus and this is how long is this after Jimmy passes away
um I'm not going to answer because I'm really bad on time but but um I can't I I don't know what to
say but probably not terribly long and are these guys are these star like people like Hulk Hogan
are they reaching out to you because no no no this is just this is what's going on this is what we're
doing for a living there's let's say in the eastern United States or the middle to the eastern United
States there's let's say there's 200 bands that is made up of people from 18 to 35 years old
that go around and play two weeks in this club two weeks in that club two weeks in that club
anywhere from Indiana and Illinois and all those kind of places all through Georgia and North
Carolina South Carolina Florida so they come and play two weeks they hear oh there's some crazy
people that make wild clothes that made Jimi Hendrix's clothes if you're into name dropping oh and
they make clothes for you know whoever I mean they go through the whole thing share and so they
come for clothes would make them clothes and they needed sometimes matching clothes and what fit
their music whatever they were doing um so we're making clothes for them and
and just this band comes it's from Tampa called Ruckus there's a real tall guy in the band I don't
think anything else we just make the clothes end of story he's the bass player then he becomes a
famous wrestler unbeknownst to me he started in Tampa they were rough on him physically he went to
Japan they made him they paired him with a Japanese wrestler and
put his name or the name of whatever they were on the lunchboxes for the little kids in Japan he
was a big star in Japan now he comes back to America and this is at the time Vince McMahon who owns
the WWF now it's a WWE but WWF at the time he's now taking all these individual sections of the
country and making one television show that does you know it's it's it's not before him it was Ted
Turner right uh I don't know before the WWE before Vince McMahon took over Vince McMahon's senior
first of all Vince McMahon that you know now is is the third generation his father did wrestling
and boxing promoting in New England area so New York Connecticut New Hampshire whatever that um
he with the help of Hulk Hulk supposedly put this thing together where they did all that brought
all the wrestlers together and started to do shows on television right I don't know about this I I
just know that I could that I have a remote and I go around I see sometimes there's people doing
the wrestling thing I got no interest in this thing but I hear he calls me on the phone one day
and says listen I'm going to be on Johnny Carson I need clothes you can you make me some clothes
I said well we sew every day you know can I make you clothes yeah you know meaning he lived in
South Tampa we where we live with his parents and he we made the clothes for Johnny Carson and then
ended up making you know more clothes for him what was the outfit he made for Johnny Carson
no idea you don't remember nothing no I have no idea um a shirt and a pair of pants but I don't
know what it was wasn't it all denim um Aiden can you look up Hulk Hogan Johnny Carson find a picture
of it or a video of it I don't know I don't think so I I would doubt that it's denim but
God knows um he may have been on Johnny Carson with a denim oh it might have been a different
time yeah maybe it's a different time but in in any event now I get a call from somebody I don't
know who this is this is a macho man I don't know who this is and I get the call I pick up my phone
and macho man says hey the Hulkster told me you can make me some clothes I'm holding the phone out
I'm like who in the hell is this the Hulkster told me the Hulkster told me you can make me you know
in his heavy voice I have no idea who this person is I said well we sew every day come on come
tomorrow you know we're here noon to six give him the address whatever next day comes with Elizabeth
and he's got little shorts that have three stars across the front and then maybe two inch letterings
across his tush this macho man you know I said dude I'm not making shorts and I need real estate
I need it from the ground to past your head but I'm not making shorts this is not me I need
you know you're asking me to make clothes I'll make you some clothes but this is not it
anyway he couldn't get to that he says well I made a lot of money with this and this and that and
he wants capes I said dude I'm not a cape guy you come to me and you say listen I need a
I need a gown for my daughter that's getting married it's twenty thousand dollars I'll pay you
you know and then we got the bridesmaids they're fifteen thousand you know am I going to take your
money you know I'm going to take your money yes B Roman numeral true Michael he doesn't wear dresses
he doesn't think about dresses he doesn't think about weddings he got no idea what you're talking
about this whole women's wedding what the hell are you even I got nothing I'm nobody home but
I can go buy modern bride I can just look at the picture I can go draw the thing I'll make the first
one and the sewers will make the ones after that and the story here's your twenty thousand dollar
gown but you're not getting the best from Mike because Mike has no idea what you're talking about
I mean none um so Randy I make him a few outfits to just get him started now he comes to the shop
again puts his head down he says you can make anything you want this is the kiss kiss of death
to say to someone creative do whatever you want and not even put a price on it or a time anything
something you can do whatever you want I make him five outfits and this is him telling me the story
I make him the five outfits and he tells me he wears his the one that he really likes he never
told me he didn't like anything ever which he had to have not liked something or didn't get
something or didn't realize something was as cool you know that I thought it was cool and it turned
out that the public thought it was cool he didn't think it was cool but then he got into it that
they liked it um so now he tells this story that he's got the five outfits he wears his
favorite outfit on Monday Night Raw and that's the second week third week now we're up to the
fifth week he doesn't say he wore the outfit that he didn't like but it's the fifth week it's the
purple outfit with the chains I said okay I'm listening to the story and he's trying to paint
a picture for me purple outfit with the chains he says I put on the outfit in a separate dressing
room I walk out of the dressing room now I'm in the main room where all the boys are these are like
old ladies who play Marjan these wrestlers meaning you can only lift weights you can only travel
and you can only travel and you can only um you can only lift weights travel and wrestle so much
then the rest you just gossip you know so and so did this you know you got 20 guys sitting around
a room with nothing to do they gossip and this is before cell phones so they just gossip he walks
out of the room they all turn they go wow where'd you get that that's great he's going this is the
one I didn't like I thought this is nothing they freaked out now he's walking down the aisle
down the corridor he tells me Vince McMahon's coming the other way Vince stops him and says
the hell is that that's great wow where'd you get it now he's going wow now I'm really in trouble
now Vince loves it now he tells me he's standing in the opening to walk out to the ring he walks
through the opening they put the spotlight on him he said and it really pops this is his word
really pops and he really gets over meaning he does well right connecting to the audience that
night really got over brother exactly and all I'm saying to you is that
he was telling me he has no idea what the hell I'm doing but go for it and another time
and another time meaning I'm making probably 45 outfits a year at 800 to $2,500 a piece
and everyone in the documentary on A&E said that Randy was really cheap and he wouldn't buy a cup
of coffee and this and that he never mentioned money I just told him you know Tony came up with
you know get a deposit so we got the $4,000 deposit to begin with you know and that worked
for a while and then she said you got to go up to ten grand might get another six you know whatever
she'd tell me I would do meaning she could see this thing from a outsider's point of view from
this is strictly business and you said how do you know the price when we first started to talk
she and I made a list how much fabric is in it how long to take to buy the fabric how long
did it take to design it how long did it take to make the pattern how long did it take to cut it
what was Vera's price to put the thing together how much time to paint it how much time to make
the pattern for the painting macho man macho man macho man how much for the glitter how much for
the paint you know on and on and on and so we go through that long list of stuff and this is when
first started to fool around with computers um that's Susan's fault totally so you're talking
about 1996 and so I made this piece of paper that you would write in took an hour and a half to cut
it it took this much to buy the fabric this with the fabric cost here's Vera here's whatever
anyway as we're doing it we're figuring out that this is what's going on but then we also said
Tony would sometimes say is does it look like it's you know $2,500 or $2,000 or $1,000 I'd say
it comes out to 1,500 but it looks like it's really you know 12 or it comes out to 12 but
we should charge 1,800 you understand what I'm saying um but it all meant nothing to him except
to say he says to me in the shop we're alone it's a 30 foot by 30 foot room concrete floor as I said
this thread everywhere fabric everywhere clothes being made patterns hanging fabric on rolls under
this table under that table on hanging on this shelf and that shelf and whatever it's I mean just
there's nothing fancy about this it's just business and
his point of view on this game is that we're doing the best that we can he sees that we're
making a huge effort he says to me just out of nowhere I'm small
I'm a big mouth as you see and I'm looking around like what the hell how do I answer
this question his arm is bigger than both of my thighs together right what do I say
did he mean that he was short you figured it out see I didn't figure it out I didn't even get this
I think what the hell is he talking about I don't know what he's talking about I'll just
leave it alone I say nothing then like a week later WWF comes to wrestle at the university in
Tampa I go there I go up into the balcony and I look what are they seeing meaning I'm trying to see
what is the audience seeing and I'm taking pictures of every outfit we make of Randy's
I tell him go outside I take a few pictures from the front from the side from the back
meaning I want to see ink on paper what does it look like what does this outfit actually look like
wow so these this is so absurd
you said the right thing brother I mean it's it's amazing the amount of
just creativity that you put into this where are you coming up with these these ideas like
what what hold your thought one second so continuing continuing
so what I'm saying to you is that we're going to come back this thing but where was I
tricks hold up pause one second I'm going to turn the ac back on it okay it popped off
aid no luck to find that picture
and all I found was something that I didn't know he was just watching
all I have was the pictures that we're going to talk about Slim Jim a little bit yeah so when
when when you're like hold these up next to your microphone that way they'll they'll be in focus
and we can see them on the camera now when you're referring to them at least okay um
all I'm saying to you is that
I'm trying to see what the audience is seeing
with a virgin eye meaning I'm just 18 years old you know my friend says well I got free tickets
to go to the wrestling let's go see it or let's sit down and watch this thing you know I walked I
saw it on tv you know what is it what I'm saying back to you is that
I'm trying to get to the place that is in the beginning you just see this thing
you don't know who made the clothes you don't know who the wrestler is you don't know what's
going on you're just going around the channels and you want to see does this stand out compared to
whatever the show is that you're watching whatever the car commercial is that you're watching
what do you get out of this you know so you're getting this is some crazy wrestler wearing
some cool clothes this is really cool what the hell is this where did it come from
who thought of this how did this even come about but all I'm saying to you is that the world just
gets wow this is cool this is unbelievable what is this you know is this like uh most of these
looks that he's wearing he's got the hat he's always got the iconic hat shape and he's always got the
long the long tassels hanging off the arms okay cowboy pimple right okay no so let's go back
you got to remember about where we were but I'll do this part now okay
he's wearing glasses I say oh let's make let's put some crap on the glasses and make them crazy
that the macho man would wear so I start putting all the stuff on the glasses and I'm working on
glasses then he says to me listen uh they made me the macho king and I got to wear a crown
mm and he doesn't like it I said okay he says I need something else for my head
but let's get I don't want to wear this crown anymore that they gave me I said fine we go to
ebore city there's a proper men's hat store with every kind of hat you could think of English
bowler you know just all kind of things through history every different kind of hat you could
imagine and there's cowboy hats there too I say oh the shape of the cowboy hat's good on them
let's see this and so we try this try that now we end up with straw hats you know I'm buying them by
the dozen um in his size and I'm painting them and I'm having covered with fabric um I'm doing
all kind of crazy stuff or I'm I'm painting them and then I'm making a band that goes around them
but
what I'm saying to you is that the other wrestlers let's say Jake the snake he's got one snake one
costume that's the deal you know you see it next year it's the same thing Randy you're seeing some
crazy ass outfit every single week and the outfits fit this character you can't say why I don't
can't give you the words but it fits this character and I'm making the clothes
and he's getting over with the clothes when he's saying to me I'm small what I'm saying to you is
when he came out of that dressing room now he's with the boys if the boys are standing up he's
just what you said short compared to the big show Andre the giant whatever Hulk yeah they're all
taller than him right so but his personality is much stronger than theirs his macho mania crazed
thing where he's living in that place this is not you know he's living there and his mother
his proper Jewish mother who comes with him sometimes the mother and father come really oh
yeah oh yeah how old was he when you were when you guys were doing I don't know I'm bad on time
I'd have to sit and think about it you're wasting your time asking me about I mean I got no thing
on rights right but the mother comes and she said and brings the dog and the father's there
whatever you know he's having to come like every two three weeks you know and they want to see what
he's doing or whatever the mother's the one who's came up with the name macho man oh really yeah oh
really um it's a proper Jewish lady and she says to me that he as a high school kid would get up
really early in the morning go practice whether it's baseball or football or soccer or what you
know I don't I don't know what they're playing but he and then he'd come back home clean up go to
school but he was like so intensely into this and didn't fool around with the girls he was working
the whole time now and again a little bit with the girls but he was working hard hard hard and I'm
saying to you that miss Elizabeth and gorgeous George both complained no day off no meaning he's
out of balance he's working hard hard hard and you'll hear this at times from people who
are very accomplished at what they do uh Daryl Hall I heard him say it you know you could say well
this 50s great songwriters here 50 great singers 50 great guitar players or you know arrangers or
whatever why is this guy got 30 songs that the whole world know and this guy's got two this
one works harder that's what Daryl is saying meaning and it's his nature right to work hard he
learned it from his parents the same macho man learned it from his parents go and break your
ass work hard this is life this is what we're telling you to do and he did it um you're saying
where do these things come from I'm saying back to you um in my shop pull it back a little farther
there you go right there I'm in my shop I get a telephone call hi this is such and such advertising
agency in kinetic at stanford kinetic it you know no one calls me like this what are you
who we're gonna have macho man push our product slim gym like I know what a slim gym I'm a vegetarian
since 1970 are you really yeah and I saw slim gym in the store but I don't know what it is I don't
know that it's dried meat or a fine piece of meat I don't know anything about it so they say well
this is slim gym we want you to make clothes for randy for slim gym commercials and this and that
and I say okay and they say there's 12 of us or nine of us sitting around this table we can all
hear you I say okay I said tell me the what what colors you want it to be and what do you want it to
be they're drawing a blank I said okay let me start talking how about we do three outfits
in using the three colors that are in your product black red and yellow okay we got that
so they'll be predominantly black and you know this one's more yellow this one's more black
well this one's more red they'll all go with each other okay I said the next thing I need I said
I need only one person to call me on the telephone and communicate with me I'm not talking to a group
of people right or just give me one person to talk to I said in 10 send me 10 grand or five
grand I don't know what I said to get started um and now again I got a free ride to make
macho man crazy but with these colors to be used in a commercial for slim gym
what you tried to say is how the hell did you come up with this or how did you come up with
this you know I just have some idea at some part in my head who knows let's try this
you know we'll change the lettering or we'll do this this way or I'll start ragging the
but you weren't worried about like what if this idea isn't good enough because he you just were
constantly making him new things this is a great point you're bringing up the point is is that
like what if he doesn't want to pay for this outfit like you were never worried about that
you had you had an infinite this is paid for this is forget that yeah so now we're talking about
freedom to be creative and the freedom is that you're making clothes for the macho man the the work
is how many outfits can you come up with in a year that are cool not might and he he never told me
he didn't like something in his life ever ever didn't even hint at it like it this is not up to
you know and he would put on outfits we had a mirror leaning up against the wall he'd put on
the outfits there's a a a junk chair comfortable foam next to the mirror elizabeth would sit in it
he'd come out of the dressing area come over look at himself in the mirror he says oh i'm gonna wear
this to wrestle mania you know now he go now we're on the third outfit he says wow this is cool
i'm gonna wear this to wrestle mania you know leo elizabeth would just roll her eyes i'd roll my
eyes you know there's nothing you could say right what he it's his way of just saying he thinks it's
cool yeah but what i'm saying back to you is that from the beginning i said to you he has no visual
sense whatsoever so he's wearing the wrong pants wrong shirt wrong jacket wrong glasses wrong hat
you're going dude what the hell's what are you doing oh you're not pairing the shit up properly
exactly and i'm saying to her or gorgeous george only put in his thing the stuff that matches you
know don't you can't do this with him because he doesn't know he's not thinking he's making a mistake
he's just thinking oh this is mike's crazy clothes let's put him on and go you know and then he'll
throw the glasses into the audience he'll throw the glasses on the ground i made an outfit once
they were wrestling in downtown st pete on right by the water and he went they threw him in the water
brand new clothes i just made with boots cowboy boots all hand painted salt water i'm a sailor
baby you're ruining my clothes and and then i gotta go mike they're not your clothes you made
them you sold them there's somebody else's clothes he can do whatever he wants with them
but all i'm saying to you is that where was my mind on this my mind was let's go buy fabric
that we can make a cool outfit for macho man i start i'm start to spend time with my wife
susan 1996 and i'm painting on his hat on his shirt on the back of his jacket on the left and
right leg of the pants macho man over and over again i don't know what the word font is i know
there's all different kind of lettering and i didn't realize they're called fonts but okay
they're called fonts i learned that and she says to me listen i'm gonna lend you a computer
for the christmas vacation 1996 and you can learn how to change the lettering around you
could stretch the lettering that's all she told me right you know so she gives me the computer
you know i learned how to do it to stretch the lettering and i start to make art on it
which i'm still doing to this day i do outdoor shows maybe a dozen shows in the state of florida
and you can see the art on my website michael baron art dot com um and that's br a un's last name so
here we are she gives me the computer i learned how to stretch the lettering and do the whole deal
with it and i'm making the patterns and i'm then i'm hand painting macho man macho man macho man
all these different ways i don't know anything about a computer if the computer i think it breaks
or something i just put my hands up and i start yelling it's broken it's broken fixed again you
know i didn't know you had to marry tech support but you do i'm just warning anybody out there you
want good tech support you got to marry it but my point is is that
again i would just led to this this woman gives me a computer that can do this all this crazy stuff
yeah um is that how you made these
were these uh good i'll hold them up were these helped out by the computer can i try them on
no no yes you can try them on okay by all means no no i'm i'm just hand painting them
um this is not a computer thing so explain to me was it his decision to paint the sunglasses
or was it your your decision is it his decision dude dude oh yeah go put them on
try these i feel try these so this is what this is is double face tape that i learned about
double face tape from sales are put together with double face tape and then sewn and this is
holographic glitter that's hand painted that's just eyeball that's there's no computer to anything
that's just an eyeball and this was complementary to an outfit that looked just like these
it that went with it yeah okay madness okay yeah and you'll see it on the net this is
isn't that rocket science here
go ahead these are really cool i think i've seen i think i've seen a picture of him wearing these
oh yeah yeah there's no problem seen through these and and the thing can be hard to see through
because of all the pain exactly exactly and your eye to your brain your brain fills in what you
can't see your eye just fills it in it's just unbelievable because every everyone says well
if those glasses i couldn't walk across the street right i'm saying right you know you could write a
letter in these glasses oh yeah totally oh yeah totally oh yeah i could drive down i could drive
down i for wearing these things that's exactly right you could also wrestle anyway so you're seeing
now if you're looking at these ones are sick sick i beg your pardon sick isn't good i understand
you don't have to explain sick to me so what this is just tape just tape right this tape
yep so this is a film that i'm buying that has a backing it's stuck to the backing and if you go to
the store that makes the signs they have a machine that cuts out the letters johnny's burgers okay
okay now it cuts it out and there's a a tape that they put on top of it where you can pull it
off and put this lettering johnny's burgers on the window and rub it down then you got it you
know so i'm using their technology i figured out how to do it um some of it i did in the computer
but a lot of it is just eyeballed um but what i'm saying to you here is that i wanted to have the
same print of this zebra looking mush that's on his belt this black jacket black pants this fringe
all kind of stuff with that exact pattern on it meaning there's at least three different color
combinations of outfits made for slim jim and then this spare pieces i got this idea for a hat or
that idea meaning they all go with each other some look better against this background or that
background or fit this newness that they're doing or this idea that they're trying to you know come
across but all i'm saying to you is that i'm just playing i'm just right you know are you constantly
trying to is it is it difficult for you or are you thinking about trying to outdo yourself for the
next one like like this outfit was great he loved it the audience loved it now are you worried or
concerned about trying to up the level of outright or how make the next costume more outrageous or
here's the answer here's the answer it's it's in two parts and the two parts are a
you're making so many outfits you don't have that much time to think so think worry
criticize yourself whatever you're going to buy fabric you're cutting up the fabric you try and
this with it trying that way that you're telling veera put it do it this way do it that way you know
veera sometimes she doesn't get i'm writing a note do this this and this on this she doesn't
sometimes understand michael what the hell he wanted she does something else maybe it's cooler
maybe it's cool um but in general there's no time to do it you're just trying to make cool clothes
mm each week each month you're trying to use all the parts so we were talking about holographic
glitter on you know these right here or you're talking about here's these are painted then some
of the stuff is painted and then the glitters put on top of the paint um i don't know if any of it's
here these are rhinestones that are glued on there um here's rhinestones that have been banged off
you know as rough as he is you know with the outfit so i'm just saying to you that there's no time
for it there's just a time to to do what you're doing go buy the fabric chop it up give it to
veera talk with tony see what she's gonna say about this or that and if you're into romance
so i start to go out with susan it's 1996 she lends me the computer
now i have her come over to the house monday night to see the clothes that we made she saw
me making the clothes she knows macho man because she's there when he's coming at certain times
she's teaching at a school right near where we are um a middle school and
and she sees this game here's what's going on you know you you can't really explain it but
this is the the romantic monday night raw thing you know you got to go over to mike's house and oh
man i'm on monday and he delivered the clothes on friday and you were there when the clothes were
delivered now we're going to see him on tv and oh this is a thing all i'm saying to you is you're
just doing the best you can is that satisfying to watch monday night raw and watch everyone wear
your clothes or watch macho man wear your outfits it was a kind of like a sense of satisfaction
people often ask this and i'm gonna say the answer has to be yes but it's really not from this point
of view in the early days i'm telling you that the vanilla fudge are on ed Sullivan i tell my
mother my proper canadian my mother number two or three depend on how you want to count
and i tell her watch watch this group the vanilla fudge are on ed Sullivan tomorrow night
you know with the clothes that we made you know because they had sent me to military school in
the eighth grade because they were hoping for you know doctor or lawyer then they realized
i think we might get post office picture on this i don't know but this guy here you know meaning
i'm not fitting in and this is a very rich neighborhood this is old time money huge houses
huge boats your parents were pretty wealthy yeah they were wealthy and but everyone around us was
wealthy so i was raised with these people and i raised sailboats with them so i got where that
headspace was and all i'm saying to you is that so i tell her watch the show you know it's the fudge
you know doing you keep me hanging on and they got lace shirts on proper women's lace you know
and i'm making a shirt for the drummer out of it you know because it's obviously not hot anyway
long story short i call my mother the next day i said mom did you watch the show
she says yeah meaning they're living in new york and obviously i'm in florida
she says yeah i said what'd you think she said well we like the clothes but they're goons
she tells me they're goons i said mom they're from farak away this is just an act this is show
business she couldn't get it she could not get it meaning she's believing what she's seeing
this is an act this is an act you know what i'm saying
yeah people back then didn't understand that it was all it was all set up it was play and didn't
and didn't like the modern music at all not even a little but this is like some horrific thing i
didn't couldn't even tell you that from 50s music 60s music early rock and roll chuck berry whatever
were your parents when you were young were they supportive of your creative endeavors
were they telling you just to do whatever you want do it makes you happy no no they're selling
to me in a military school then they see my sister gets me out of that that's three years of that
then the last two years of high school i'm in a very proper boys prep school in connecticut
you know and you know one of the teachers that i had it was a real bright guy english teacher
he said you should get a job as a barber he knew i cut hair meaning i see someone cut hair
and i see that i could cut hair i you just seem let me see you do it once i can i know i could do
it you know so i'm cutting hair to make money you know spare money he says you should get a job
you should have a trade is what he's saying to me meaning you're a moron dude you know get a trade
and and go do that um and he's not saying it isn't in an insulting way you could take it in an
insulting way but once i sort of found my way is that i had an ability to make something
that was artistic and or cool for stages you know end of story there's nothing you could say you
know did i kill myself to learn how to do it to how to make patterns to all exotic sewing machines
buying sewing machines buying fabric you know there's an art to that um i mean and so i worked
hard at it but it just doesn't fit into the normal you know he grew up and he became a lawyer and
he defended whatever kind of people you know speeding tickets or you know whatever it is you
know just it's beyond me
ah my father sees that he can't do much with this kid
and even my sister before me the same thing um in a different way but the same same deal um
my father arranges for his son that he can't get to do well in school or listen to him
he sends him to the midwest of wisconsin to be in a training program he he invents this a training
program in hamilton beach because he's making stuff for them he knows the guy that's the president
of it so he says that the guy listen you know my have my son be around there for a few months
and then we'll send him to your uh advertising agency let him stay there for a month and let
him go with the pr people for a month you know that are taking care of the chef that just left
the white house or whatever so he knows what what is the game to be to be making electric
carving knives how does a big business work how does an advertising company work how does a pr
company work how you know how does this go so the guy does it because he's no way can get out of it
you know you got mike he's a pain in the ass but he doesn't talk much thank god so you know we'll
put up with him and so i learned okay this is what the advertising business is about this is what
pr is about this is what manufacturing is about i'm going to all the business meetings with the boys
that are supposed to know what they're doing and all that stuff all i'm saying to you is it just let
me know i don't like this at all the military school told me you don't want to be involved this
is not a fun thing mike later you got to look under a lot of skirts people a lot of people
said it that way you got to see a lot of people don't understand what it's like to be in those
different worlds and i was backstage as a child that maybe six years old um maybe seven my mother
who preferred dogs to humans and my parent my father would bring home people to do business
in this big fancy house and the proper people and all that stuff and my mother in the first 15 minutes
she would say i prefer dogs to humans you know i mean she just dropped the bomb like i'm not into
you great icebreaker exactly great icebreaker and she had in my house my whole childhood between
six and ten dogs in pairs show dogs so from tiny dogs to big dogs but in pairs um
and so i'd be around all these dogs all the times and and i'm just telling you she's into
show dogs end of story so the guy that's showing her dogs the handlers what they're called
he works at radio city musical he is the uh stage manager for radio city musical so
my mother gets me in there she says okay go backstage go with him and you know now we're
standing and the rockettes the girls that kick their legs up in the air beautiful girls
so they're they're hooking up and then you know one gets on to the next one they're holding
each other's shoulders and they're kicking their legs up and there's maybe 30 of them or
i don't know there's a lot of girls now maybe i'm seven eight years old i'm going
i never saw anything like this before i was never backstage before there's something sort of cool
about whatever these beings are that are kicking their legs in the air i'm going
something cool with this what's happening here why does it make me feel funny yeah this is good
what is this um and i also went some connection to my to my birth mother's family had something to do
with tv in miami and they were doing the howdy duty show i went i'm a little teeny kid i went
there i sat in the peanut gallery so i'm seeing what this is so this is meaning i'm backstage
and then i'm in the front of the stage i'm seeing what's going on so this is like just a part of
life to me it's no big deal for me to go to talk to carmine you know he's playing in you know some
military kind of place you know i thought nothing of it and
so i was used to being able to communicate with these people we may close this is how we do it
here's you could choose this you could choose that whatever um randy you know you say well
are you concerned about that he liked it or he didn't like it he got over in it is what it was
and it helped him to compete in his head against the people that were bigger than him meaning he
was making a bigger stronger statement than they were visually right with his personality how he
talked how he acted how he wrestled but in this documentary they just did on him he had some
very big match in wrestlemania three and whoever he was wrestling with
randy tortured this guy two they had a pad of paper like a legal sized pad
every line is the move and they're rehearsing in these moves this is three pages of run here
do that flip me over here flip me out there you know slap my face step on my foot flip me in
and guy says how hard randy worked on this he's working for randy meaning he's just
trying for this to be great and they say this is his best match ever all i'm saying to you is that
this is hard work and i see him at times tear shirts that i've made for him throw the glasses away
you know do all kind of crazy stuff it's this is him i'm making clothes for that person to do
what they want but it's the same with jimmy jimmy gets what i'm doing for him it's working for him
he likes it it's good that he can contact this fool in tampa and say i need more of this or more
of that or you got something for me i got madison square garden in two weeks can you come you know
would you cut you and tony can you come so tony and i and alana go to madison square garden
you think he's calling me up to invite because he wants tony and michael and alana to come
he just wants new clothes what he wants he'll take michael and tony yes he will sit in the
front row yes we have a table of him dedicating a song to us you know where it says this is
dedicated to michael and tony and alana you know but all i'm saying to you is that
if you take all the emotion out of it this is just business this is just he's making a product
that's working for these people you can say he's working hard you can say he's talented you could
say he's not talented you could say anything you want about it just it's just business um and i was
taught that because that was one of the lessons in life for me to learn like you know everyone
freaks out and they say you know when we started to do the outdoor art shows susan writes a bio
born here went to school there made clothes for and then it's you know 15 aims or whatever big
name drop did you ever meet share did you meet jimmy henricks i said oh no no we did it through
the internet you know they even have an internet then um they couldn't believe that we ever met
him you know and then i said yeah macho man what was he like you know all i'm saying to you is that
people put these entertainers on some pedestal right some special place these are humans you
know and they're not treated like humans the more the the fame is the less anyone could be one on
one with them back to you know women are having sex with me just to say they had sex with jimmy
henricks you know you never thought of this in your life i never thought of it in my life but
once it goes down i'm going you mean these 13 girls that are lined up here they just want to
have sex with me because they heard i made clothes for jimmy this is why well i'll try a few try a
few you know you understand the silliness of it but it's a sad part of humanity that i was forced
to see meaning i'm just a human like everybody else you know and i got my favorite actor or
actresses or singer or whatever you know that if you you know i got to go make clothes for
whoever the thing is i'm i why why did that make him sad though why why would that make you sad
just because this isn't that isn't that just the the nature of humans or the nature of
sexual beings they they attract to the the dominant alpha the the number one the person
who's going to protect them the person who can okay the answer is yes to what you're saying but
he was hoping they'd like him for who he was just jimmy not because he sold 10 billion records or
not because he was the best guitar player in the world you know none of that or that he wrote
phenomenal phenomenal songs he wanted them to like just jimmy
i mean and i'm just i'm not saying that this doesn't go on that this is in a not a need-based
situation that it is it is a need-based situation but he was hoping for a higher need meaning you
really were you loved his personality you loved his humor you loved his way of being
you loved his love you know whatever but not just because his name is jimmy and
maybe he wanted a deeper connection okay deeper says it in a simple way he wanted
you know did he ever have a long-term girlfriend or anything like that i don't know an assortment
yeah an assortment never someone that he could
settle down with and have children with and maybe that's what he was looking for and he found
something much more shallower with all these young teeny boppers bouncing through his hotel
room every night exactly exactly i wish i could empathize with with his problem but i can't imagine
putting myself in his shoes so i don't know but if they're 15 were lined up each day
after a year or two you got to select one or two or three you know you got you know
and they're they're here because they hear you're a billionaire
you're a billionaire you just he's a rich guy oh we will have a we'll take some time with him or
he's rich and he does this or that whatever the thing is you know after a while you go uh well
i like the sex but if you're in that line just because i'm a billionaire you're almost disqualifying
yourself you know what i mean for something serious exactly exactly wow so what did you
try how did you transition into doing what you're doing now
susan
let me a computerize as i said in 1996 so i could change the fonts around and stretch the fonts and
make the patterns and all that stuff for lettering that i was doing by eye and by hand and
in the process i bought a program called painter got 400 virtual brushes in the computer
and i started to paint now a year goes by i show it to you i say what do you think
you know we're old friends you're supposed to tell me you like it you know you look me in the eye
say yo mike keep your day job meaning it wasn't bad but it was nothing to die over and then in time
it just evolved into i'll show you five pieces we'll take a break and i'll show you five pieces
is it on your website yeah yeah uh what's your website called michael brawn michael brawn art
dot com one word aiden pull it up aiden pull it up dude man
um yeah i can't imagine i mean jumping from doing what you're doing creating
these extraordinary outfits outfit designs for people into like did you just one day just quit
or did it no no no no i'm playing with the computer and after a year it starts to get cool
and people are going wow i want that you know can you make me one of those
um we get into art gallery susan gets me into an art gallery you know people they're selling the art
then she says we need to do outdoor art shows and i give her the old man oh this sounds like a
slap and i slap slap what are you talking about this but she i don't want to deal with all these
schlemiel's schlemiel's so she gets me into the outdoor art show which is correct meaning
you're getting to see the people respond to the artwork they don't care about you they just care
about is this something i want to give this guy money for they don't care if you they don't
like my flip flops or my jeans or whatever just care if it's gonna look good in their living room
exactly exactly right and so we're making art and it's selling um but to me it's the same thing
it's just the creative process and the beauty of making art and a computer is that there's no
no first of all there's no one saying i got madison square garden in two weeks and i got to
have some great outfit or i got wrestle mania in ten days or whatever so that pressure is gone
or don't spend you know it can't be more than thousand dollars or two thousand dollars whatever
the thing is the other thing is this is that as i'm painting yeah that's interesting the biggest
difference is your your clothing work was all commissioned and this is the opposite of that
the opposite of that not to say that some of this is commissioned that they say i want that piece
but i need it six feet tall and it's got to be read people say that to me and i'll do it
i'm not saying it always works sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't but my point to you is that
i'm free to make the art back to jimmy you know whatever takes you there you know
don't be hesitant to take and make something anything to your fancy as long as it's specially
made his art here i'm saving the file at 50 percent 70 percent 90 percent you know and
there's what i call the steven stills effect meaning the day you make the thing steven stills
wrote this song love the one you're with you think it's wonderful you know a week later you're going
wow i didn't see that it was too blue or the lower right corner is just not doing it i don't
know why but it's not so with the computer i can then change this into let's fix the lower right
corner or let's make this blue thing that the person wants in red let's do that so the freedom
of trying this or trying that or changing the proportions this was fairly square now we got a
long thin horizontal piece or a long thin vertical piece i mean it's just wild and the people you
get to see what's going on in an art show they don't care about mic at all they just walk and they
look they look they look at the back of the tent decides inside this and that they're looking to
look and they just say i want that one they don't care where did you go to school what was your idea
what was your inspiration how the hell did you ever get to this they just go wow i want that
that's all end of story you don't have to talk mic you can shut up we don't want to listen to
your crap anymore and how does that make you feel oh it's fine it's great you're not connect you're
not you don't have any sort of emotional connection to attachment to your art to the stuff that you
all of it all of it none of those because i did it so many hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
times you say well now you see this thing on an album cover you see this thing on television
you see this thing on the macho man documentary you see this art piece that this people wanted at
90 inches wide you know i tell them well i just go put your tape on the wall and tell me how wide
you want it the guy emails me back 96 by you know 30 or something you just some huge thing you know
you know meaning he's not thinking it's huge he's thinking i put the tape on my wall that's
what mic told me to do i saw the sample of what he was talking about he emailed it to me i saw his
work i just loved that i want this piece he made it a little green or i just stretched it for me
and now it's this size it's fine what i'm saying to you is that there's a percentage of people
in an art show or selling clothes or wrestlers that love it some people got no idea in what you're
doing some people says what is that crap you know and they're entitled to it's all it's just
part of life and so i'm just making clothes you know some of them sell i'm just making art some of
itself some they're looking at me like the hell are you thinking mike you know meaning i do things
mostly where it's a series i might have five of these i might have 20 of these you know i'm
trying this i'm trying that let's make it green or blue or let's change the format of it let's do
this let's do that as i'm doing it i'm not thinking i'm thinking well maybe this will be better sometimes
i gotta be away from it a day or week a month or whatever or i spent all this time i spent two
months on this series and and did it all different kind of ways and colors and shapes and formats and
whatever you know i like it susan she says yeah it's all right nobody else it's nobody or
some guy that worked for rush limbaugh he and i liked it and that was in the world there's two
people you know it's a funny deal so but that's just part of the game so back to your thing about
making the clothes you're just making them all the time and you've been beaten into the fact that
some of these clothes they'll think is wonderful something they're not going to like some
they're going to tear they're going to rip they're going to go into the salt water in
you know some he's going to throw the glasses you know it's just part of the game it's you know
that it's different than what you think it's going to be if you don't know anything about it but if
my as soon as mike tells you that here's the game here's how it goes you're going to you're
going to paint 10 pictures you know three are going to sell and seven they're going to just walk by
like they're looking to go with the baby in the stroller or they're looking to buy jewelry or
they're looking to buy you know plants for their backyard you know you know what's happening here
you know you're just doing the best you can with the parts in front of you but it's not personal
they don't care about you if someone came to you and wanted some sort of special suit some crazy
design suit would you do it for him i'm not selling anymore i'm not selling anymore no i stopped in
2001 thank god so no more no more put that behind you that chapter of your life is closed um i did
it i would say i did it and i'm very glad to do art on a computer it's a very clean thing to do
i'm not involved with any people i can change the thing you know if it's not so good i enjoy it um
and the other thing i'd say that's sort of strange is there's something there's something like really
unique and
there's something about a piece of art you can buy that you can wear wherever you go
there's something about that that's different for sure and and people
got exactly what you're talking about meaning they're not educated in this at all and they
they were very happy to get one-of-a-kind pieces um because i'm they're asking for it to be a certain
way i'm making pants jeans with buttons down the side and button fly and you know denim
lined and top stitched and lacing and this and that you know they're glad to get it and they're
talking about it to this day they bought this in the 70s and the 80s and the 90s they're still
talking about it i got this outfit from i still have it you know got over big time with it you know
anyway
oh uh maybe there's a there was a couple named lance a bear
and his wife lived in st peter's a sax player in a band keyboard player songwriter
um had a daughter had a baby whatever in the 70s and she became a sax player that's known
mendy a bear a b a i r i think i'm spelling it right anyway she calls me on the phone she says
listen i live in la i mean and i obviously remember her and i know the parents for a thousand years
i live in i live in la the guy that makes my clothes i showed him a pair of pants that you made
from my father in the 70s he and i needed him to be altered to fit me he told me he wouldn't
touch him this is he never saw anything like this in his life it's a mechanics of it the whole thing
he this is in another place so i said when you come to florida come i'll do him so i i
we took the pants apart put them back together where they would fit her and all that um and she
wore them on american idol and all that and took all kind of pictures in them but all i'm saying to
you is that do i know how to so yes um am i glad to do a job like that for her for no money yeah
of course but my point is is that this whole emotional thing about seeing it on television
or an album cover it's not there it may just be me it may just be me i don't know what to tell you
it may be how i needed to see this whole thing in order to get through it if i was spending time
you know that this jimmy hendrix outfit i didn't like the way it looked or jimmy ripped it or
the audience didn't like it or they didn't use it for the album cover you know whatever
it's a different place i would be and maybe you know i mean it's it's also the most tremendous
incredible marketing you could have had for yourself it's it's you potentially would not
have been as successful if you were if jimmy hendrix wasn't a international superstar rock
and roll musician you know i mean like my story is i say well if you're making clothes for god
in those days you know you're just saying well i'm making gods clothes you know and so you know
that's you know one can say anything you know they say you're into name dropping you know and
you understand what name dropping is and you know some nash film musician i can't think of who it is
he says yeah paul mccartney told me i shouldn't name drop you know or some kind of thing like that
he was making the joke meaning this is a big deal but you're saying you make clothes for jimmy hendrix
or this guy that i'm taking you to make clothes for jimmy hendrix but on the another side of that
thing is that everybody with eyes saw that we were making clothes that was around tampa they saw it
so the pimps started to come in the 70s the 80s the 90s they started to come we're making clothes for
them in this area in this area the pimps so we're making clothes for them well i don't know about
pimps i i never met a pimp before this but i got an education it was beautiful meaning these are guys
doing what my grandmother was doing she's trying to survive they're trying to survive so the story was
i'm making clothes for a guy named joe i call him pimp joe we make him lots of clothes and
it's all good when joe brings someone to the shop another pimp
he says as he introduces that person to michael he says he's all right
what he's saying is he's all right with what we're doing he's all right with our skin color he's
all right with whatever he's not making any judgment he's making clothes is what he's doing
you want clothes he's your guy but he's not unhappy about your shoe size he doesn't care what kind of
shoes you have he doesn't care what kind of haircut you have he just makes clothes end of story and
in the process joe tells me he picked cotton in georgia i think it's georgia could be carolina
but he picked cotton and when he was 19 he went to new orleans a prostitute saw him and says come on
i'm going to teach you how to be a pimp you're going to be my pimp what exactly what exactly what
meaning she knew the game she knew this guy looked the part and could act the part he taught him how
to be a pimp he comes with the Cadillac Eldorado and all that stuff anyway so we're making clothes
for him we're friends we're we're laughing we're having fun now i don't see joe for a few years i
don't think anything of it because they move around in and they go up north they do this that
whatever i don't see joe now a car pulls up to our shop behind our house on bay shore boulevard
south saint south tampa two guys get out with suits i'm just telling you nobody ever came to
that shop with a suit on what are you talking dude you know what are you doing with the suit
it's just there's no reason it's not that it's against the law it's just not a reason
you know these are music people these are wrestlers suits no so they come in
they said hi where with the fbi i said oh let me see the thing let me see the sticker and the
badge and all that i never saw this meaning here's mike mike's not doing anything to break the law
not because he agrees with the law or disagrees with the law or anything or that he wants to
break the law he just sent to peace of mind he doesn't want to be worried they're gonna come
and arrest me because i was speeding over here or they think i robbed a bank or they you think i'm
this or that make no difference i don't care i did nothing you know you're gonna you want to listen
all my phone conversations and see all whatever wrote on the computer you'll die aboard them and
the story you know that's i'm warning you so so they come in i get them to show me the badges
oh this was so cool i wish i had pictures but i don't so they show me they say do you know joe
lee sanders i said no they take out the mug book big fat mug book and they open and going going
you know we're on page 20 or whatever i said oh yeah it's joe pimp joe i know him
when did you see him last i said i don't know i'm really bad on time but maybe a year and a half
maybe two years i don't know why he was stealing mail he went to jail for stealing men they're
looking for him again for something i don't know for the same thing i don't even know what
they leave now another year goes back by maybe two i mean again i got no idea on time
now joe comes i said joe what's happening the fbi came here and all that it was great i i mean i got
to see the badge and everything and he says he said it was a white boy crime they taught me white
boys taught me how to do steal mail on the beginning of the month for some kind of thing you
know people get checks in the mail and that you know you just sign them and you cash them and
whatever i mean i have no idea what i'm talking about but i mean that's what he said something like
you get some kind of checks at the end of the month or the beginning of the month and he goes to
jail for this thing um but all i'm saying to you is that this is just a regular guy trying to survive
meaning that's why he's doing this right i'm not saying anything about legal illegal and
what it taught me was he's no different than jimmy he's no different than macho man everyone's doing
whatever they do as best as they can whatever their destiny is however the thing works out
and it's nothing to criticize him about and it's nothing to say it's wonderful about it's nothing
it's just this is joe this is jimmy this is macho man this is miss elizabeth this is these are just
people to you they're all people to you they're all people that walked in your shop that you wanted
to create they wanted you to create something for yeah i mean and above my shop where we made the
clothes is an apartment so we it's rented to a couple that we know the lady is a singer the man
is connect is her manager and is connected with all the r&b groups he knows about this
he brings two guys with him and he just shows him this is what micah's doing meaning these people
aren't interested in these kind of clothes but he brings them in the shop and the radio's on
and whatever's on the radio they can sing harmony with whatever i don't care what it is they could
sing harmony with it this fast as it's going by they can sing who is it it's two of the pips
gladus night and the pips rainy day and rainy night in georgia oh this is them exactly oh wow
meaning i'm going wow these guys can really sing this is a wild thing that i mean that i know nothing
about it i'm not a musician i don't know about that part of it but i know that these guys were there
in the happy place with singing background music and these were the pips you know meaning
exactly exactly um but i think the other thing about you saying about all the clothes for jimmy
or macho men is that i see him so much on the internet and on movies and things and album covers
that it's just it's just a part of life it's just you know it's something that you did exactly
something that uh exactly i think i found it so interesting that how you were able just to
treat it like a job just to treat it as i almost didn't have time for and that was the destiny to
show me that these are standard issue human beings everyone everyone don't judge anybody
be kind to all of them be a human being you know this is you know that's why joe is saying
he's all right you know he's saying that we're i mean nothing um jimmy knows that i'm concerned
about the clothes i'm working here i'm trying to make some cool clothes for him that's what he wants
not because he's jimmy hendrix because this is what i do and this is who he is meaning i told the
story in in this documentary that went by recently on a and a documentary on macho man randy savage but
that as i'm making the clothes for macho man in that shop is glasses being made i mean i got pictures
of maybe 15 or 20 pair of glasses on a board being made at the same time where i'm painting the
edges of the glasses or i'm putting the the glitter on them or i'm painting this but there's all
these they're lined up in rows and rows i'm painting lots of glasses um but my point is is that in
doing this i'm seeing that the business of trying to do it as well as i can is made worse
by the distraction of well this is going to be on television this is macho man this is this is
just another guy meaning i'm just trying to do the best that i can with the parts again that are
in front of me and what do you mean it's made worse it's distracted i'm my creative or my work
ethic is distracted oh by the attention by the loss of breath because of who this person is
okay there's lots of way to say it okay i see what you're saying i'm just they're expecting something
i'm expecting something tony is expecting me to make clothes that's what i do end of story there's
no more to it there's no romance to it it's business you know and so then i could see oh i gotta go
fix that buttonhole machine these buttonholes aren't right or i need you know a thousand pearl
buttons where am i gonna get them from i gotta fly to new york and then go to new jersey and find
someone that's making you know one inch pearl buttons and i'll buy seconds and shift through and
not use the bad ones or whatever um so there's just so much of time that is eaten up with the actual
work of the thing that you get away from the side ideas of this person's famous on account of or
this person went to jail for whatever or you know meaning these are all just humans i learned this
as a little kid so i got this kind of mother i lost that one and i got this kind of mother i lost
that one i got arlene arlene's a brooklyn dodger fan oh man i mean and now the game is on television
television was just starting then now arlene's vacuuming for hours the foyer where the television
is so she can watch it because she's a devoted fan you understand what i'm saying but i'm saying
to you that i i love this one i love that one i mean i'm on my fifth mother do i love them all
yeah and do i listen to them yes you know i'm telling you this mother that i have now that's
younger than me she tells me to do this or that you know or buys me echinacea tea that i got it you
know i gotta take it it's insanity this is just ridiculous um and and the poetry thing that i talked
about you know where i'm thinking well well i i i'm not into poetry what are you talking about
then i realized what jimmy's doing is poetry and that he's doing it in a phenomenal way or
dylan's doing it in a phenomenal way um it's just did you ever save any of the letters he wrote you
oh i'll email it to you you could put it on with this you still have them i have a letter i'm gonna
send it to you okay oh he's gonna put it on are they on your website maybe this what she's doing
she's gotten up she knows the game that's incredible man so this is written on telephone memo pad
so it's a pink pad and it says on the top and this is obviously from the very old days it says
so-and-so called it's such and such date and such as the time here's the subject they want you to
call them back with this information and they're available at this time at that time whatever
and the other side of it is just blank so that's where he's writing dear couple do this do that more
shirts with odd sleeves double stitched the pants okay she's working on it uh she's working on so
what i'm saying to you is that um oh there you go it's lower right hand corner is it okay
maybe you can punch in on it zoom in on it adan i'll send it to you okay yeah yeah send it to me
that's really cool now you did stuff for bob dillon we did you know we met bob dillon at
what's called curtis hickson hall now it's just a park they took down the building um
we had a girl that that was around in the day calls me and says listen i'm at the clear water
whatever it is i don't even know some hotel uh on a huge piece of property very old building wood
building um i'm with bob dillon you know uh come show him clothes whatever the jack tar hotel the
Scientology building no no no no no this is wood it's it's on a big piece of property it's the oldest
it's the largest or oldest wooden structure anywhere in this part of the world or some kind
of thing you'll find it you'll find it yeah um and so we go there and he's just finished painting
a four this is my guess four by eight sheet of plywood he painted it it's a painting he's laying
on the floor laying on his back in the sun looking at the thing very quiet he
now starts to the band is rehearsing in this huge dance hall kind of place but big
wood and there's nobody in the audience just myself the guy that was with me i think randy
edwards was with me um and one of the guitar players for the rolling stones who died soon
after that i forgot his name um i can't think of his name anyway he he we're standing there they're
playing there they're practicing bob is outside now i'm outside and there's a porch cotton or
not a porch but the thing that goes around the edge of a building you know an eight foot wide
whatever it's called um bob is sitting on the floor of this leaning up against the building
and he's whittling he's got a knife and a piece of wood he's whittling and i'm going what the hell
is going on here and nobody talks to him except they walk over they lean over from the waist
they say whatever they got to say and then they walk away no one he's not talking to anybody he's
just i'm just telling you what's going on now he goes over to the stage and he starts to play with
them they got a very young violin player girl that's supposed to be phenomenal and they're playing
and he says stop and he says this you don't know this part or this goes like this and they try it
again he says okay let forget that one blow it off meaning they're not doing that song because
she's not playing it right whatever i mean and they're just playing off the top of their heads
there's no sheet music or anything like that now
he i show him a denim coat like to your knees this is used denim from goodwill carefully cut up
ironed padded shoulders lined in velvet coat with ribbons on it
and we did a lot of ribbon clothes in those days um
he sees it he thinks it's cool and i forget exactly how the thing goes he takes it and i think then
it gets given back to me later on he doesn't he doesn't have it and i think he just buys some scarves
and stuff but this is a quiet person our experience with him at that time i mean and there's maybe
50 people in all those bands that are playing with him um the rolling thunder review was the name of it
um so
i'm with a girl that worked with us don jordan and she's so blown away by this is bob dillon she
could even stand next to me she had to walk back as he walked to me and we're talking
she she she couldn't handle it this is more than she could deal with this is this is bob dillon again
this is like god to her or some kind of you know whatever this is crazy um so all i'm saying to you is that
the expectation of that person is let's do business you got some clothes you got some
art you got some whatever the thing is right let's do that you know i don't need to come around you
