You just mentioned that last time you were here you were like one of the opening acts
now you're the you're the headliner at the show you're doing down here.
Yeah man.
You're on the come up son.
A lot of changes in two years bro like you had the last time I was down here two years
ago like in September I was definitely just like the opening comedian and I was even catching
a hard time for that like Tyler said something up that they do Tyler and now I'm fucking
headlining and we just added a show because they're selling out so.
That's so sick bro.
I explained to you like I was telling Johnny last week when he was here like my boy shout
out to Johnny Mitchell.
Johnny yeah he's sick.
Your style of comedy is so much different than a lot of people because to me at least
when I watch you and I listen to you talk to people especially when you're roasting people.
I feel like the main difference is a lot of other guys I can tell they're trying really
really hard like I can tell like they it's obvious that they worked hard on like the
shit they're talking about in their bed or whatever but you I feel like you're it feels
like you're not even trying it feels like it just comes natural to you.
Well yeah I mean you know not to my own horn but that's different between that's different
between somebody being good and somebody being great you know what I'm saying like anybody
who does something and it looks effortless you know that's like when you're like oh this
guy is a natural instead of somebody who's not really a natural comic and they're trying
to really be a comedian like you can you know the difference in everything like somebody
can practice real hard and be a great baseball player but you can tell people who are born
to play baseball.
Yes there's a big difference you know and then being able to combine like the discipline
and putting in like the hard work and the time into it as well as having that natural
ability that's really what sets people off.
Ten thousand hours.
It doesn't know it.
Ten thousand hours.
They got a noise.
Oh it's the fucking it's the AC.
Oh okay.
Yeah we I dub it out afterwards.
Oh okay.
It's not super annoying is it?
I just.
I mean you can think right?
Yeah I can think.
For y'all I was like did they hear that?
No yeah.
I'm real sensitive to noises.
I gotta get the AC system replaced in this thing fucking piece of shit.
Yeah ten to ten thousand is that like the Malcolm Gladwell thing he talks about?
Whoever did it.
But it's real because like you can I can feel myself becoming like more of a natural on
stage and it's becoming more just like a seventh sense instead of like actually going
out and do comedy.
So it's like I'm just going on stage and giving you my personality while I'm performing
instead of I mean I still have a set that you know I've written and prepared but you
know like like you'll look at comedians in the early days like if you look at Dave Chappelle
like a lot of stuff you do in your early days is real jokey and then the more you do it
and you become great it becomes like more of you like nobody else can say it but you
like if you look at Dave Chappelle now so like that's the growth.
You know some people don't like it but it's just it's just it's what comes natural.
You mean you kind of like fall into like this own lane you've created like you kind of like
like carved out a niche for yourself and like a certain style so you kind of like more like
lean into that harder and harder.
Yeah once you find your voice that's what you know you'll hear you'll hear a lot of
comedians talk about finding your voice on stage and that's what they mean like you know like
like I can go on stage and rant for 20 minutes and it's not prepared right because I found my voice
and I know what inflections I should say and what's going to be funny and what's not going to be
funny so I know how to say it and why to say it and where to say it.
Right yeah you definitely know how to read the realm.
Yeah yeah that's very important man like like a lot of comedians like always ask me for advice
and I'm like bro just just be funny like you know stop trying to like have a scientific
a scientific formula to be funny like just be funny.
Yeah just be you.
Yeah just be you bro.
Yeah.
You're going to stage and be you.
You said you just moved to Austin?
Yeah I'm out there in Austin now.
How long you been there?
Since August so I moved.
Joe moved you down?
Yeah man you know Rogan had to get all the all the best down.
Yeah he had to get all the best people down there man.
He's creating like a comedy utopia man.
I mean didn't like Duncan move down there too and a bunch of guys down there.
Tim Dillon, Tony Hensfield.
Yeah so what's the scene like there now?
Is it just like way bigger than it was before all that?
I'm sure it has to be right.
So the first time I ever went to Austin was shortly after I did your podcast which was
like December 2020 and Rogan was there.
They had did a couple of shows and I came down there to do some shows with Tony and then I
would hit up other spots and the scene just wasn't a scene.
Like it was just people on stage you know writing some shit.
Local people and stuff.
Yeah saying some shit they just wrote that day and it's like fuck bro.
I'm like if this like it's not gonna make me better you know what I'm saying.
I'm like if this is the fucking yeah because I'm like if this because in LA bro you might
have to follow a killer.
You might have to follow you might have to follow a theovon in LA and you're like oh
shit I brought my A game but these motherfuckers here you're like what the fuck is this you know
what I'm saying.
Right.
So Rogan started doing a residency and I do it a lot with him it's every Tuesday and well most
every Tuesday and Wednesday.
What does that mean residency.
Well you just continuously do shows at the same place.
Okay I got you.
Yeah so he does a residency at this place called a Vulcan and that's pretty much every Tuesday
and Wednesday and that's a great show to be on.
Like he expects new material he doesn't want you to do the same thing over and over again.
He really challenges comedians and that's why when he opens his clubs gonna be the best club
in the nation in my opinion.
Because I don't feel like any comedy club has ever opened a comedy club to focus on the comedian.
Every you know comedy club has opened focused on how we're gonna make money.
Yeah how we're gonna maximize profits.
So he's actually opening a comedy club where it's like comedian first.
You know what I'm saying.
Right he doesn't have to worry about the business side.
I mean you do but not like you're not doing it just because you have to make some money.
It's kind of like that's like his whole like bro like Rogan's so dope bro like and like I said
I've never seen a comedy club be built before but he'll bring us all in.
He'll be like what do you think about this what should we do and it's like damn like I have input
in one of probably that's going to be a historic comedy club and I like I have input.
What you think about this color what you think about that color what you think about
this many seats what you think about having drapes right here like we should lower the ceiling so
that the sound it's like wow I like I have input you know what I'm saying so it's like it's like
mind blowing and you know it's taking a while because he's like taking his time to fine tune
everything so that we have the best lighting so that we have you know whatever the best
measurement so that the sound stays in the room the best so like we were there a few months ago
I believe it was maybe August August so yeah I was I had just freshly moved so either August
or September and Lucy K was in town and uh he told me he's like these ceilings are way too tall
really yeah he's like these ceilings are just like that yeah and Rogue was like well what we got to do
how tall do they got to be yeah and so uh he lowered the ceilings man like seven feet no way
just because you know feels more intimate maybe more intimate in the in the laughter like you
know you get a full you put 250 250 people in a room I think the one room holds 250 and others
gonna hold like 175 but just put 250 people in a room that's built to hold sound and the ceilings
are low it's gonna sound like you're in a fucking arena yes that's good he's doing that bro you know
damn well he didn't do any of that when he set up that red podcast studio he didn't talk to anybody
he might have talked to one guy yo how should what should I do to this make it look like
fucking a red hellscape that bro that's him like yeah that was Joe's vision yeah yeah that's that
was him building what he wanted like bro even when we were you know uh talking about designs he's
like yeah I want the bar to look like the bar from the shiny oh shit you know what I'm saying so it's
like bro you got money you know what I'm saying yeah you got money like that and like he's real
passionate about comedy but more so he's more passionate about the comedian you know what I'm
saying the experience being there he takes care of all his friends like you know what I'm saying
that's why it was easy for me to stick up for him with motherfuckers we're trying to call him a racist
yeah and I was like well if this is a racist give me more yeah yeah I think I like racism bro it's
so crazy how a lot of the comedians will just fucking turn their backs on people when they get
called out for being racist or saying some like anti-jew shit on the media or whatever yeah but
these comedians will never make it yeah these comedians will never make it or if they make it
you know there'll be soy boys you know what I'm saying so it's like it's like bro your time's gonna
come like there's gonna be a time when some shit about it's inevitable if you're in the spotlight
some shit is gonna come your way it you're gonna have some yeah you're gonna have some
disgruntled bitch you're gonna have some old employee you're gonna have something where somebody
tries to take from you because America is just a greedy place or somebody sees an opening and they
try to you know slide into that opening then they can cook up whatever story and it's like
bro like if a girl came out from 15 years ago and she was like I didn't really want to have sex with
him but yeah it's like bitch I don't know like maybe I did talk you into it because that's what
guys do yeah let's go get a drink see how you feel you know like come on girl let me just stick it
in a little bit yeah let me get 10 pumps let me get 10 pumps every guy has done that yeah no doubt
every guy has coerced his way into a girl's vagina yeah that's what men do that's what animals do
every guy has come on man you let me just eat it let me yeah let me suck on your tip like every guy
has done that so you know if some girl were to say he coached me into having sex with him it
it could be a game right that's the game like life every guy you know takes a bitch out for drinks
in hopes that she gets loose and go home the fuck is that wrong you know what I'm saying like
I feel like it's a big difference in me taking you to drinks to get loose versus like popping
something in your drink like Bill Kaiser yeah bro the crazy thing about that whole n-word thing
with Joe that they tried to cancel him for is I saw what I don't remember how long ago maybe it
had been over a year ago before the whole thing happened on with recently with him yeah he was
he was doing his stand-up routine and he actually brought it up during his stand-up routine he's
like there's a video out there of me saying the n-word compilation a bunch of times and he was
like I forget what the joke was but it was like even I went fuck yeah yeah yeah he's like even I
thought I sounded even I thought I was racist for a second yeah he uh like bro he before it came out
you know what I'm saying he uh he told all of us yeah I'm like bro like I know your heart dog
like even if even if you call the black person n-word I'd be like Joe you fucked up but I know
your heart you know what I'm saying I know your heart dog like and you know you've helped me take
care of my kids and you helped me establish myself in Austin so what I know this dude's
heart it's a great man he's opened his house to me and you know open his money to me his
pockets and opportunities to me so yeah bro like I know your heart and if you're advancing people of
color like like I don't see any racist traits in your body right and it's like Patrice O'Neill said
man comedians are all trying to be funny and Patrice said the birth of a funny joke and an
unfunny joke come from the same place and you don't know if it's funny until you say it and
Rogan gets stoned he gets high and I can see how the the the story of uh the the plan of the apes
and I felt like I was in plan apes came about you're trying to be funny I've tried to be funny
before and it came out racist and you just didn't say like oh fuck you know what I'm saying like
that happens you know especially you know you're on your podcast you know we start if we started
drinking and passing a blend around and we started talking about Indians or Asians or whatever
something racist can come out because I might say a funny then he tries this thing at being funny
and it might not come out right but people were not in that moment they take stuff out of context
yeah and then they run with it and you know it's it's just oh the Rogan video
but whenever you're in a situation where you have to say I'm not racist you
f***ed up and I clearly have f***ed up that's weird it's all good Joe you could tell they edited
that too like there was some there were some cuts they they cut it down they cut it down to be
shorter they they the media hated on Joe because his whole stance on the covid vaccine yeah they
were trying to find an edge on him for a while he has more influence than they do now yeah he ran
circles around Sanjay Gupta yeah you know it's like now they owe him a big apology when these
articles come out about you know the vaccine possibly causing myocarditis and f***ing up girls
periods and women that are 60 years old getting the vaccine and and getting a period again after
not having a period for 30 something years and then you know women becoming infertile like somebody
owes him an apology it should be on CNN yeah like for someone to be weary of a vaccine that wasn't
really tested like that I mean don't you don't gotta go back too far if you look at black people
you know I'm saying with the people in the the the Tuskegee experiment you know what I'm saying
which one is that uh isn't it isn't it the Tuskegee experiment where Tuskegee was that it
where they were giving black people they're supposed to be giving them a vaccine and then
they like injected them with smallpox what I don't think I heard about this you ever find it the
Tuskegee experiment yeah syphilis study at syphilis yeah in 1990 or 1932 the US phs working with a
Tuskegee Institute began I lost my place began it began a study to record the natural history of
syphilis it was originally called Tuskegee study of untreated syphilis in the negro male now referred
to as the US phs syphilis study at Tuskegee the study initially involves 600 black men
399 with syphilis 201 did not have the disease participants informed uh consent and participants
informed consent was not collected researchers told the men that they were being treated for
bad blood a local term used to describe several ailments including syphilis anemia and fatigue
huh so like it says in exchange for taking part of the study they received free medical exams free
meals and burial insurance what so it's like yeah so for black people to be wary of a oh yeah
fucking vaccine like come on well black people the the um african-american population and specifically
in like new york i think we're having the most adverse medical side effects to that vaccine
i think than anybody i mean bro i've had that shit a few times have you had kovia i have never had it
what never fucking had it you got it once you're a dirty boy bro it's weird i've gotten sick like
i've gotten the same same symptoms multiple times and i tested myself and i always tested negative
my wife got it here's one thing the one that was out last year i i took hella test bro because i
was sick because i've had like two three times and i took hella test last year and they all came
back negative but then i tested uh positive like a week later for the antibodies strong
antibodies like i had just got over no shit so i probably had it i never took the antibody right
right yeah so i was at rogan studio actually oh really he has a he has an on-call doctor
you know shit yeah you still do that what's that he's still doing that test for everyone now probably
no that was last year yeah yeah yeah that could not have been cheap but yeah bro there's so much
fucking sketchy shit that's happened in the history of this country with vaccines and shit
even in like afghanistan the the cia there's a store the cia set up a like
uh syop vaccination camp for people they were telling them uh they were telling the afghanistan
people that they were getting vaccines but they were actually like shooting them up with some
bullshit that was fucking them up somehow god damn i forget what i forget what it was you probably
find out what it exactly was you ever seen you ever seen the video okay yeah cia organized
faked vaccination drive to get osama bin laden's family's dna hilarious you ever seen and i i i get
it bro when we we were not started on morality in this country no no so i get it i get it we're
we're a fucked up nation that's how we've acquired a lot of the stuff that we've acquired we've did
some dirty shit we did some sketchy shit to stay number one and to stay number one for as long as
we stay number one you do have to be fucked up so i totally get it yeah and along the way
i don't want me or mines being collateral damage you know what i'm saying you want what being
collateral damage i don't want me or mines me or my family right collateral damage so
you know i'm glad that i do have the resources that i have and i can go to doctors that my
richer friends use and be like hey should we do this and they'll be like well you know what i'm
saying like doctors who are not pushed right by big they're gonna be honest right that are not
pushed by big former companies you know what i'm saying yeah um hey can you find a video one fun
thing about afghanistan of the american soldiers trying to uh teach afghanistanians jumping jacks
have you all ever seen that no oh my this is why the situation that kaboo happened bro these people
these people are not coordinated like type that in on youtube american soldiers teach afghanistanians
they're trying to teach them jumping jack bro so you think they can full screen it so you think
they can fucking teach them how to shoot a rifle bro and you wonder why it's over there so full
look they can't he's kicking the legs and the arms at the same time
something's so simple
this guy just can't get it he just can't
oh my lord he went one that is so fucked up
that guy's got it yeah kind of that's the one person you trust with a gun all right we got one
oh my god how you supposed to teach these things is how to use the AR bro they probably they probably
they probably grew up using AR they're probably in preschool shooting AR
you can't do it jumping jack oh my god bro that's that's why they didn't want us to pull out of
the e-class that's why they didn't want us to pull out of kaboom bro because they're like they
get soon as y'all pull back al-qaeda's back look who the fuck look who holds on they're fighting
these motherfuckers can't do a bear crawl oh my god bro you see the video of them trying to hold
on to the plane that was taken off from the runway and they're falling off the fucking plane i'm
fucked up i was laughing at this oh that's crazy they're the same guys who can't do a jumping jack
they're trying they think they can hold on to the fucking landing gear you know what bro like
i'm a proud american citizen you know what i'm saying so when i see people like britney
greiner and all these other people who denounced america and then you see a situation like that
and it's like you should be you should be glad that you're in a fucking country where you can
even talk bad about the fucking yeah government anywhere else that shit would not apply bro like
katar over there and all that shit where they having uh the soccer games right now bro people
are mysteriously dying for saying bullshit you know what i'm saying bro so it's like that that one
soccer player is from iran he's getting murdered executed beheaded yeah when he goes back yeah
whatever yeah i didn't hear about that yeah so it's like bro like they lost and he said something or
or said something and they're like when he goes back he's getting fucked up he's he's done yeah you
know what i'm saying he's scared to go back i mean like remember the columbian soccer player who
scored a goal in his own goal no the oh he got beheaded yeah yeah so it's like yeah like not
only are they not coming to get you like you wouldn't even have been playing basketball yeah man so
it's like when you see situations like that it just makes me appreciate yeah where i live like you
might hate it or love it yeah they can't get you there's not too many other fucking countries
where you can become a self-made millionaire right my my dad's family's from cuba and dog
there's no way unless you better box play l of baseball or be a great ass singer like bro what's
that doing ain't tweak tweak you never heard of tweak the baseball player no oh yeah yeah
bro he was basically like oh some slave shit really a person in texas bought him from cuba
and then that person in texas sold him to the dodgers oh bro shit like bro these other countries
though so that's why it's like bro you're proud i'm like bro go to north korea where they show
propaganda that they they fucking uh take it over america you know they they got a brainwash
citizens constantly you know what i'm saying just to give them hope to keep on living so it's like
you should be happy you can say bullshit you got free speech did she say negative shit about america
before she went over there or was it after she was already in russia before before yeah she was kneeling
for the anthem and doing all that she probably changed her tune though i bet you she changed that
shit now i mean you've been in a russian prison her fucking her her locks froze off because it was
so cold so it's like you should really come back a new person and have a different perspective
really should on where the fuck you live that we traded an arms dealer for your gay ass one of the
biggest most prolific on the arm dealer that nick name he was like this your boot yeah something
he had a crate yeah there's something of death or something the doctor of the dealer of death or
something all i know is what is it look up look up that guy all i know is the merchant of death
merchant of death oh yeah all i know is uh nick cage played him in lord of war and that was a
fucking sick movie see the thing then think the thing about that guy too i don't know if he wasn't
i don't think he was really that bad of a guy i think he was just making money off he was just
like exploiting opportunities to sell that's what i'm saying that's how you have to become rich over
there yeah right like you there's not working a nine to five and you can't really legally be rich
over there right right in communist countries dog there's no you got to do some illegal shit
yeah you know what i'm saying and and if you supply arms to terrorists then
what was it eventually charges could see conspiracy to kill americans that's bullshit
that's some i think that's some fucking american political thing they try to use an excuse yeah like
you sold guns to somebody who's selling guns to a country that we didn't like conspiracy charge
yeah the conspiracy charge is bullshit i wonder what they kill him when he get back over there
he's already doing a podcast bro he's already he's already doing interviews over there like
yeah he went yeah i wondered like how does russia feel about him because i know he's been over here
with 20 years long time yeah we've got some shit out of him yeah yeah don't see don't see i a torture
treat yeah yeah you know they fuck yeah yeah he wasn't just sitting in the cell for 20 years
they interviewed him a couple days ago and one of the ladies in russia was asking him like what
what do you think about america now compared to what you thought before he goes before i got
locked up there you know we would look at america like the shiny town on the hill and now they have
36 different genders and the places go into hell they're like they don't have the christian or the
catholic values that we have in russia they don't have there's nothing binding americans together
they're fucking more divided than ever there's a million genders and nobody gets along he was like
yeah it's all that gender shit dumb as fuck uh yeah um rogan talks me and rogan have had
conversations about how a lot of um superpower places get fascinated with gender before their
demise like they get fascinated with gender and then they end in like 100 or 200 years really
like we'll be gone like shit gets so good and comfortable that they can't we can't find problems
like we need problems to solve but once shit becomes so good like we have we look for more
and more problems we dig for problems we need a we need and it's sad to say we need a 912
the day after 9 11 when all that mattered was being an american citizen you know what i'm saying
being an american bro like i i think i was in the fifth or sixth grade like and i still remember
the unity you know what i'm saying like bro like i'm from deep south like you know from down here and
raising georgia yeah i was raising georgia and i remember man like having conversations with grown
men about being a proud america like i would wear an american t-shirt and they'd be like oh yeah we
had these conversations that i felt like if that would have never happened we wouldn't have had it
you know what i mean and people were just proud like people were putting flags in their car yeah
everywhere yeah you know what i'm saying like dog i feel like some shit like that would make people
see what what what was really real and all that other shit ain't real bro like fuck your pronouns
yeah you're stupid it's stupid there's bigger problems yeah uh what's that guy named matt wash
y'all follow him no is he the guy who did the uh the documentary on yeah yeah yeah what's it called
never what's it what's the fucking about a woman yeah it's about he interviews basically a bunch of
people who got like gender reassignment surgery and like regretted it after yeah bro because it's
it's like dog you over here you over here and and i get it it's on both sides like you got women
that are fascinated with bbls like people in america are just culture vultures what's popular
right now i want to do what's popular yeah i want to do what's popular right it's a drug
you know what i'm saying yeah so it's like i get it man like you know like you want to fall into
that and be accepted it's like there's a comedian i ain't gonna mention no names and uh la and the
the dude started taking hormones you know what i'm saying what kind of hormones the women hormones
oh and grew titties or a little bit and the facial hair went away but the dude's still got a dick
and he still fucks women and i'm like you're fucking selfish yeah you're not what you're
trying to display yourself to be yeah you're just out here doing this because it's what's popular
right now bro and it's also like it seems like it's the rich kids that are doing it too it seems
like it's the wealthy people or like the kids of celebrities yeah that's what happens man you get
you get bored they think they're bad it's like they think they're better than everyone or like i'm
not i'm too good for male or female i gotta be something yeah like jaden's real time i want to
cut his dick off cut it off stupid motherfucker cut it off yeah i love my dick yeah that's crazy
and dwayne wade's kids you see the shit that came out about dwayne wade oh god his his mom is not
with that shit the kids mom is right really right yeah Gabrielle no no no that's not his mom oh no
the mom oh he got a different the real mom the real mom i just feel like
like kids should be innocent bro and um you know um i don't want my kids i got a two-year-old
eight-year-old i don't want them knowing about heterosexual or homosexual sex yeah at their age
right yeah it's not important yeah you know like let these kids grow up let them be fucking kids
without trying to have them identify or something when we were kids we didn't like bro we would have
took a Barbie and played with it it didn't it didn't mean that i wanted to be a girl it was just i was
a kid i don't know any fucking better right yeah you know what i mean like i used to try to make
my cousin's barbie's fuck yeah put one Barbie on top of the other one yeah yeah bro it's crazy
because like i mean it's just it's incentivized by what i mean politics and money mainly right
because now there's like all these hormone clinics that are all over the country that
are charging all this money making all this money trying to promote it making all this money and then
what's the end goal though so move that if the if you move the base like towards it it won't tip
okay yeah but what's the end goal i don't think there is an end goal bro i don't think they've
thought it through yeah because i've heard these fucking binary or whatever the fuck they are people
call women that give birth breeders and call them i haven't heard that one chest feeders
you know i haven't heard that i bounce in between la and austin so i get it all you know what i'm
saying like la bro that's like austin's liberal but it's not la liberal like they're still conservatives
that drive lifted they they say they're liberal but it's like bro you have not been to la you
you motherfuckers drive lifted trucks and eat meat yeah these motherfucking liberals in la have
they're the real deal yeah yeah yeah they don't want to work they want they're lazy you know what
i'm saying all these offended me what are you offended by everything like dog that's why you
suicidal in the press right now because your ass can't take a good verbal ass kicking but people
in la like a majority of people in la like the mystique of la is show business right so people
that live there that are entwined in show business they want to like follow they want to
stay in line with what's acceptable in show business and i think the main that is being
extremely liberal liberal and far left and being like socially conscious of everybody and don't
hurt animals that's just changing it's slowly changing um and i think in the next five years
yeah like and then also like i hate the reference rogan but he's one of the most
knowledgeable people knowledgeable people i know and he's like these people are just a small group
you know i travel america for a living and my comedy is pretty right you know on the right
side of the political scale and it's a very small group of people bro it is like we look at la in
new york you know what i'm saying and that is a very small percentage of the population
because there's a lot of conservatives in southern california like the whole orange county
you know what i'm saying yeah like san diego san diego orange county in general like riverside
all that shit bro there are people who want to tote their guns and they're they're kind of like
libertarians but you have these few fat vegans in la with purple hair that don't want to work and
talk about you know what i'm saying systemic racism and it's like bitch don't be offended for me
yeah yeah you're not oppressed no bitch yeah the fuck white people have been great to me yeah yeah

for sure my life's not in danger you know what i'm saying bro like it's it's what isn't are they
getting a new isn't la getting a new mayor karen bass karen bass yeah i heard uh i heard uh i forget
who i was listening to talk about maybe it was tim dellon he was talking about how they are shuttling
all the homeless people out of downtown la just so they can make like her inauguration look good
like because they're doing like a big ceremony for karen bass to be the new mayor and there's
i guess there's tons of homeless people in that area we got like a hundred and twenty thousand
so they're getting buses and they're moving them all out just so they can they put them in hotels
and shit oh my god wow how crazy is that our city oh my god oh there it is with la uh swearing in
the new mayor cruise work to move homeless in canvass bro let me tell you our city has not
been right since mayor veera gosu pardon this brief interruption but i want to take a minute
to talk about this incredible supplement that i've been using for over a year now
after it was recommended to me by nutritional scientist dr dominik dagustino on this podcast
i take dom's advice when it comes to anything related to nutrition diet and longevity because
as we get older these things become more and more important that is why i started using verso
verso is a company that is dedicated to translating scientific breakthroughs into products that hold
the potential to increase longevity i take cell being this one right here which contains nicotinamide
mononucleotide or nmn based supplement paired with naturally derived micronized trans resveratrol
and tmg these two chemicals are actually precursors to what's called nicotinamide
idonine dinonucleotide which is commonly known as nad and nad is essentially the precursor to
energy cell repair and longevity if you've ever tried fasting or even intermittent fasting and
you've gotten that feeling of super high energy or mental clarity is because your body is activating
these genes called sirtuins which are actually longevity genes the downside is as we age nad
declines when i found out i could naturally increase my body's activation of sirtuins and
naturally activate my body's production of nad i was sold and it is so much more affordable than
doing nad iv drips head on over to ver dot s o and use the coupon code concrete at checkout to

or you can just go to ver dot s o slash k on c ret it's linked below back to the show which one
was that how long ago was that criminal bro he's about eight nine years ago like when i first moved
to la it was bro like homeless people were centralized to one area you know what i'm saying
they used to they i used to live downtown bro they were literally in the morning like six
am go out there with fucking water hoses and hose them down you know what i'm saying like get the
fuck up out of here bitch like and that's what people don't understand bro you're talking about la
county that's a place that that holds like 13 million people right some states don't have that
population right you can't be this righteous soft you know get run over mayor veer mayor veer agosa
was a gangster there was a rumor about him taking guns to to to his meetings and and you know he just
got shit done bro like you kind of be you kind of got to be a criminal dog you kind of you kind of
got to have a criminal mindset it's like Gotham city like you know a righteous motherfucker can't go
to Gotham city and make it right no you got to you got to have police that do shake downs that
kind of gotta do some shit yeah you got to kind of beat the criminals ass a little bit so that they
know like motherfucker these mind suits yeah you're not gonna do this without repercussions like bro
like they're like in la right now that's why we got all those massive uh death rings where it's like
20 people were breaking to Neiman's they're like 15 000 out of shit because the minimum
for a felony is like 1500 now so if 20 of us go we can get $20,000 worth of shit and nobody gets
charged with a felony and we'll be out to go home for dinner that's fucking wild bro you got to start
you got to like you got to start back racially profiling that like you can't that's not a city
type it in on your computer bro how much orn robbery in crimes have increased in la over the
past like two three years yeah it's crazy right i my apartment leadership bro well that's that's
not that's not california it's like a guy talking about economy but also there's well there you go
one out of 48 see this one out of 48 shoplifters get caught he said and they're just fucking
they're just filling up their bags at walmart no regard
what why why do you i mean the people that are in charge of la and in california the people
like the politicians do they think they're doing the right thing it started a few years ago
um when uh we had this one city council woman i can't remember her name i think she was a lesbian
and it got to the point to where they could they had to stop touching homeless people's tents
because it was considered their property even if they set up on a fucking sidewalk right
and then they had this place echo park where you know families go there's a lake you can walk
around the lake and they had a lot of homeless people these homeless people were doing like
fucked up shit with kids and shit present jacking off fucking smoking shooting up and all these
fucking lives and vegetarians were like no you can't kick them out the park bitch bring them to
your house yeah right yeah yeah they're already bringing your kids over there like come on you
don't have kids you don't desire to have fucking kids because you think for some reason that you
were born asexually so you don't even want to have kids you know what i'm saying yeah so it's like get
the fuck out of here i take my kids to public parks to run around and i'm a licensed gun carrier
in the state of california and i will kill a motherfucker if they do some bullshit mm-hmm i'm
gonna protect my kids at all costs and i got money for a lawyer so it's like most people in la are
scared most people in la are very terrified and what's with the there's also like a push to not have
kids with people like super far left i know like there was a lecture done at some university or
whatever and one of the i forget where one of the big universities and like the professor was talking
about uh growing up and like overpopulation on the planet and shit and she was like well
you know some people it's okay to have kids but it's it's probably the more responsible thing to
not reproduce they're dumb bro it's like a it's like a it's a weird thing that's happening with young
people now they want to like prioritize their career and their money before like i want to be
rich before i ever have kids like make sure my career is right what's the point of getting rich
if you don't got children leave it to what a dog leave your money to a dog
cat yeah some fucking foundation that don't really give a fuck about you and they'll put a plaque
on this million they stick in their pocket anyway yeah yeah yeah the the fucking CEO of a homeless
shelter walk around making a three hundred eight thousand dollar a year salary because your dumb
ass donations bitch yeah right the pastor flying in his own private jet but like you can see the
argument though when you look at downtown la and you see all the fucking prostitutes and crackheads
that probably had no father they probably grew up in like a circle of poverty and drug abuse and
fucking who knows their uncle that comes to accountability that comes to accountability
bro if if they really like if they really force parents to be parents parents to be parents
like dogs like i i come from fucked up circumstances and my mom could have easily abandoned me
you know i was raised by my grandparents and she could have easily abandoned me and i could have
easily chosen to go left when i chose to go right because i always knew even when we lived in the
hood that i wanted better for myself you know what i'm saying and uh yeah it's it's up it's what do
you see what are your parents instilling you and what do you see your parents doing did you know
from a really young age that you were like destined you like wanted to do something more with your
life and like yeah when i was like eight years old told my mom i was gonna be like will smith
which i hate now because he slapped chris rock and i said i just had chris rock i just had dinner
with chris rock like a month ago bro no uh yeah it was fun what was it yeah what was that like in
the comedy world like how did that rock the thoughts of everybody and stuff like i've seen
chris rock multiple times like when i used to be a door guy at the comedy store before then
yeah and uh this is my first time being like in an intimate setting like we were at this
right they called so rogan chris rock was in austin performing at the moody's center and
rogan rented a restaurant for us and chris rock was actually right here and rogan was right there
his writer was right here his sound guy was right there william montgomery was right there
and he has a crew of like 15 people so you're all in chris does yeah he got a big crew yeah
you know a fucking arena act yeah so i'm sitting next to chris rock from the time i meet him
he's not the chris rock you see on stage you know what i'm saying he's not this loud boasters person
and he's just so small and so fragile older guy and you know will smith what six three six four
yeah he's a big big guy you know you can obviously tell you're still physically active with weights and
dust and chris is small you know skinny fingers and it's like i felt so bad for it and i'm like
how could will smith do that slap this guy and it made and i grew up a very big fan of fresh
prince summer summertime with him and jadie jep and i'm like how could will smith slap i would feel
like such a bitch ass motherfucker slapping someone like chris rock mm-hmm like how did he do this right
bro like will smith you have a sketch or uh uh yeah sketch sketch in one of the episodes of
first prince where you wanted to be a stand-up comedian so you get jokes this man did not
the joke was not that bad right and i think he did it to a person he knew he can get away with it
definitely i don't think he would have slapped steve harvey no
yeah it's weird bro it's uh i wonder how chris rock did the same thing he chris rock did the right
thing excuse me he did the right thing like on a setting like that the oscars like bro like me
yeah it's a different story right bro first of all will smith when it came on stage with me
because like bro like but i'm you know like i was born in the hood then when i became a
teenager we lived in the suburbs but i have like those hood like you know when i be on dates and
shit girls be like why are you so paranoid i'd be like girl you gotta watch your surroundings
and you know so it's like i got those instincts still and i look at body language and like if
you're walking towards me i'm like hold on what you're doing bro you know up in the like what
you doing yeah why you walking towards me like that you like i said a joke about your wife like
i'm already knowing like this dude ain't coming up here to shake my hand you know what i'm saying
like i'm gonna push you out like what you doing bro yeah kick you kick you like i'm i'm gonna figure
like we would have been tussled he walked up there kind of like he didn't walk up there very hostile
looking he kind of walked up casual and then he kind of turned the other way and then he just
came out of it don't he yeah but what are you doing walking up will smith is coming up here
yeah i'm like no why will smith come up here i just said a joke about your wife yeah what did it
did it jada used to date something like tupac or something yeah she dated tupac
yeah because they did that movie together there's there's a letter back there can you pull that
up there's a letter that uh willow wrote tupac saying tupac can you come back my mom misses you
what see if you can pull that up willow's letter to tupac
but what's the headline yeah find a better home to get a drink real quick
so it's like if if will smith has to live in this image of tupac then it can be a very
fucked up do you think it was like he looked at jada she gave him that look and he was like
fuck i got it do you think it was like a look absolutely yeah right yeah she gave
yeah they're sparkling or not just regular you want spark i don't think i have any sparkling
school i think she gave him that look yeah she definitely did yeah everybody who dates women
know that the woman has a certain look is just a letter dear tupac i know you are alive someplace
i think that my mommy really misses you can you please come back can you come back so many
so mommy so mommy and me can be happy i wish you were here i love i really do love willow willow
so how much does this woman talk about tupac where the where your right where your daughter knows
something like that and that's at a young age that's you can see that letter bro you think
tupac's still alive could be his auntie down in cuba wasn't his mom like a black panther
his mom was a black panther and she was involved in some conspiracy where there was like they were
all there was like a what did they do that they shot up a grocery store there was something i can't
remember and there was like a there was a fucking so there was a guy that was in the black panthers
i think it was a white guy i could be wrong but he was working with he was working with them for
years and he basically convinced them all to like plot some sort of scheme to either rob or shoot up
a grocery store or like a like a retail store and that guy who convinced them all to do it
because they went on trial for it that guy ended up being like a cia agent or a fbi agent yeah i
mean um there's some good interviews i can see you bro you watch vlad tv no you should watch those
i've seen them it's hard to walk bro they're weird they're just like just only watch the ones where
he gets like don't watch the entertainers watch the people you don't really know like he has this guy
called um he's a big fan of vlad tv yeah i can't watch him since a long time mob james you know
mob james interviews yeah that sounds really familiar so mob james used to be sugar knight
security and uh tupac basically was a theatrical dance being who ended up around gang bangers
and should never have had that persona yeah he went to like arts dance school in new york
that's where him and jada met yeah yeah there was interviews of him when he was like in high school
where he was like talking about stuff and like talking about culture and he like
sounded really smart and articulate i mean he was different you can hear this music oh for sure
and then he was a backup dancer for uh digital underground before he became a rapper the Humpty
Dance the Humpty Hum he was a backup dancer baby do the Humpty Hum are you big into conspiracies
or do you not pay attention to i like them you do like them i just like different approaches to
stuff so it's like let me hear your opinion on this you know what i'm saying i like different
approaches to see what's your favorite conspiracy theory uh the one that made me laugh
there's your favorite one that made me laugh was that uh kovat was made by 5g
how did that one go yeah tell me more i didn't know oh bro it was black folks
they're like 5g makes kovat they put up all these 5g towers and that's why we got kovat right now
and the towers are somehow like like spraying kovat out of it sometimes i'd be feeling so bad to be
black because this shit they be saying i don't know so what the what the 4g make yeah the 5g
make oh what the 4g make hiv sometimes i'd be mad at my people though i'd be like what the
fuck are you saying like kanye yeah how do you feel about kanye right now kanye is wild as a person
that you know you know all of us probably battle mental health issues i can recognize a manic
episode yeah definitely you can see the difference between some of his interviews when he's like normal
i don't want to use the word normal but it's just regular and then it's like sometimes he's
just going on go look at his rogan interview yeah then go look at his uh drink champs interview
yeah his rogan interview i really liked actually and i saw that clip with rogan when he was like
you got to approach kanye like lex did that guy lex i don't know if you guys saw that interview
yeah i watched that one and it was like lex didn't play no games no and he was like you can't just call
him jews he's like you want to call him out you got to call him by their full name call him by their
name and they kind of you could tell he was like stumped he was like all right but if i do it will
you help me he doesn't the problem with kanye and i used to have a friend who's working for kanye
and kanye only likes yes man around him so it's like any stupid and i'm a big kanye fan i still
wear his shoes you know yeah and it's like uh any stupid idea he comes up with you have these yes
man that support it you don't have anybody to challenge you you don't have anybody to be like
hey motherfucker yeah come on what the fuck are you doing you're about to lose your legacy
he needs a real person by his side yeah and everybody needs that and for me that's my family
you know what i'm saying or the girls that i date like i date real women i date women that are so
far away from the entertainment yeah you know i don't want you to even know who the fuck i am yeah
yeah you don't watch youtube good yeah i never understood how some some people like to have
like girlfriends or wives that are in the same business that they're in or do the same shit

shit
yeah fuck that no bro that's that's that's that power you got that power over me my life
yeah eyes water it's like we've been gagging on the day starting over yeah
oh man weren't you so going back to your childhood you were how early was it that you started like
performing doing comedy like how young were you like 16 17 really in in georgia yeah that's
real hosting talent shows at the high school so performing at poetry lounges uh like by the
age 15 16 i knew either my future was NFL or uh entertainment really do you play football too
yeah yeah what did you what position did you play DC defensive tackle yeah i want to take me
yeah okay run somebody over yeah i'm still pretty strong yeah i'm still a bull yeah
you know what's you know what's crazy i had an opportunity to go to ucf i wish
really i would have went really yeah i applied to go to ucf i didn't get in
they offered it to you i actually tried and failed football no no no i wanted to go to film
school there they had like the best film school like one of the best film schools in the country
so what do you see i let you know yeah them and you see after like the two biggest yeah you
should have like franks is for a copeless daughter yeah i had the dude from the better the guy the
dude who you ever heard of the Blair witch project of course the guy who made that he wrote me a
letter of recommendation even to get in there because he's like one of their most successful
alumni i they still didn't let me in yeah but that's that's that's not like uh you know what i'm
saying wasn't Spielberg that's not like a Blair witch project you know no but if you look at money
wise like they made the most they were the most profitable right and it was innovated they were
the first people they were like not necessarily ov style yeah like the the the film like the
cinematography wasn't anything special right it was all fucking the actors with shitty cameras
but the idea of found footage and making it the marketing behind it it was the first time
i remember that being an elementary school bro yeah yeah yeah it's the first movie it was the
first movie where you would go to the theater thinking it was real shit it could have been real
yeah you didn't people didn't know it was fake yeah it cost them 35 grand to make the whole thing
what does that say oh it's 249 million globally and that was years ago it was god damn that's like
388 million now that's like crazy profit bro what does that guy do now
oh i think he uh he works for some company in europe now he's made a bunch of like horror flicks
after that they never really hit like the Blair witch yeah but they've had like multiple Blair
witches were those yeah there was a couple no no so what they did after the first one they
sold it they sold the franchise to Lionsgate and they bought it they bought like the rights
to Blair witch and then they ended up like fucking greedy fucker why don't you just retire
why are you still working you make a lick like a two a quarter of a billion dollar lick that's a
lick of 35 grand 35 grand oh crazy they were still in college when they made it i mean bro we could
legit right now film a movie on our iphone yeah that's a way better quality we can film a movie
on our iphone yeah have it you know professionally edited mm-hmm yeah i mean i wish you should
podcast on iphone really i saw that i saw that so i mean that's crazy bro that's a lot of work
we would have to you know uh aim it towards the titty boppers you know the teeny boppers the
high schoolers but we can make a lot of money what do you think what do you think it is about
like the whole podcast thing blowing up that like it seems like i don't know we talked about it
before but it seems like the whole like comedy community and the podcasting community are super
entwined and like all of the like everyone in the comedy scene they all have podcasts and
they all go on each other's podcast how does the podcast shit help comedy well i mean bro
podcast for a comedian is kind of like having a business card um hmm people fall in love with
your voice they fall in love with your essence they fall in love with who you are they don't
they could want more they can almost care less about your jokes uh so uh they just want to hear
you talk even if you're rambling that's why asmr is popular they fall in love with these people's
sounds you know what i'm saying so it's like you have to and then i mean it's so profitable bro you
do youtube you know how much bro yeah no i know but still i'm like i'll turn my youtube into a six
figure of your business before uh good for you man before it got so big though like every it started
with comedians i feel like didn't it didn't it just start with like true comedians well i mean
before they made money if anybody i could say the podcast king i'd say is rogan in red band
you know back when they were doing podcasts before it was even popular you know what i'm
saying people like what the fuck is this but does it help you when you do podcast even though
like you probably don't plan out podcasts you probably just kind of like talk shit but does it
help you with your comedy and like does it help you with your thinking process and your creative
process when you do podcasts like oh shit we were talking about something good maybe you know
something we talked about during that podcast i can expand on that i mean comedians can just talk
yeah we could talk what you do we could talk for a long time so uh i mean you're you're you know
a new fan is a new fan one new person who can buy merch or buy tickets i love you yeah you know
i'm saying you i might reach you know every podcast is a new audience especially especially if you
want a podcast it's not a comedy podcast yeah because now i get to see real life people who
might not watch comedy right and now they're like oh i gotta who is this yeah yeah i gotta go see this
guy at a comedy show right so uh yeah i i love doing podcasts you know i like to talk and uh i
definitely like podcasts when it's not comedians because like i don't want to be funny yeah i gotta
i gotta match your fucking funny you know i don't i don't want to do that shit yeah so uh yeah it's
funny i really liked your podcast with Duncan that was funny as shit damn bro we found that a
while ago yeah you saw that i listened to it yeah yeah we found that it was good he's an interesting
dude and he's crazy he's an interesting motherfucker yeah he is bro Duncan's out of his fucking mind
bro he was talking about he got contacted by like DARPA for doing some some fucking conspiracy
podcast he said after he did a podcast with joe talking about conspiracy theories whatever DARPA
DARPA is like i forget what it stands for but they're like basically the cia like the defense
look up what DARPA means i kind of remember but i don't remember he's uh he's a buddhist too right
defense advanced research projects to angels yeah they they reached out to him after he did a
podcast talking about conspiracy theories he talked i thought he talked about that on your podcast
maybe he said it like briefly yeah but i'm saying that podcast was so long yeah yeah i've had so
much other information come in my head something like i remember it but it was so long ago that was
like yeah that's before your podcast yeah oh really yeah yeah i think so yeah when did you uh become
buddhist it's more of a mindset bro it's just like you know if you if you think about the future
you're anxious if you think about the past you're depressed so it's like living the now i got buddha
tied on my hand to remind me like just to live in the now you know what i'm saying so for me it's
more of a mindset spirituality i treat you how i want to be treated um and just have respect for
all living things what got you interested in it what how'd you discover it um so there was a point
in my life where i was uh not sure about spirituality and not sure about what was what and you know
like i feel like i look at god every time i look in the mirror i feel like i'm an expression of god
and uh buddhism just kind of aligned with my values at that time in my life you know what i'm
saying so it's like i like this and it's like okay it's metaphor it's metaphorically speaking
like when buddha was born everywhere he stepped lotus flowers bloom and it's like okay do i believe
that kind of like you know Jesus though you know so it's like it aligned with me yeah buddha buddha
i think buddhism is the one religion where they actually don't believe in like a deity or a god
which i think is interesting i mean bro i feel like our religions are the same like it's based on
morality yeah it's based on faith and you know a lot of a lot of people you know because i consider
myself a republican a conservative and they're like oh you're probably a conservative when you
don't believe in jesus it's like i do believe in jesus i respect the story you know what i'm saying
a lot of a lot of religious deities have the same story you know there's christina
it has like 65 different versions of jesus christina's or aphids bay i'm in rye you know if you
do your research and it's like can we discredit all those how can we discredit anybody who's living
off of the same thing you're living off of which is faith yeah so it's like i i can't down this man
because he believes in what he believes in yeah as long as he's not trying to push it on other people
that's my whole thing i'm not trying to convert you right you know yeah it's not like Scientology
i believe in god i believe in jesus i believe in Muhammad i believe in all of it so it's like
that's that's just my level the weird thing about the like part of r e especially talks about like
Judaism Jews they only believe in one version of the story like the original version of the bible
yeah but there's like 65 different versions of christianity like southern baptist baptist
fucking episcopal yeah there's so many different fucking weird versions of it yeah yeah uh yeah i
i try not to think too much of that i just try to stay funny yeah think about being funny and
not really wrap my mind in that too much because we don't know we just don't know
and how i feel about it there's one mountaintop however you get there is your choice you may
chose the harder way you might choose easier way but we're all gonna get there yeah for sure
have you ever heard of uh i was this podcast i've listened to i've talked about it before but
there's this thing it's called like the idg podcast it's like the super not super but pretty
like right wing podcast where this girl i think she's a comedian but she's also does fitness and
she was talking about uh horseshoe theory with uh baptists and she compares baptists to bootleggers
so you know how like in some some towns where you can't serve alcohol you can't sell alcohol on sundays
in texas there's towns in texas that you can't serve alcohol you can't you can't buy hard liquor
on sunday in texas connecticut was like that too really you can buy like beer and wine but you
can't buy in all of texas well in austin it might be all wow i didn't fucking know that i remember
moving to connecticut and i went to buy beer on like a sunday or liquor or something they were like
you can't you can't buy it today and i was like what that's coming from florida crazy goodbye till
i was in portland bro and like i remember they shut the liquor store down like at nine i'm like
bitch crack is legal here yeah right how the fuck can you tell me i can't get a fucking bottle of tequila
that's insane yeah but that's weird that is still still a thing though like and she was anyways
back to what i was talking about the horseshoe theory if you look at the baptists and the bootlegger
like the idea of horseshoe theory is that there's two ends of a continuum like too far like left
and right wing like the farthest version of left compared to the farthest version of right
and instead of it being just like a continuum that goes forever it's more of like a horseshoe that
bends and the two extremes are closer together like a horseshoe is and they come she compared a
baptist to a bootlegger like what does what does alcohol being banned on sunday how does that benefit
a bootlegger because you can't buy it on sunday so they can stock up on all the booze and they can
sell it for a for a profit on sunday yeah i i know people in texas who sell alcohol really
marked up on sundays and then she she goes so now look at a baptist they don't want alcohol to be
sold on sundays for moral reasons for religious reasons so she compares she goes now look at
extreme leftists and the kkk what do they both want they both want segregation because she was
comparing there was like a school in semitabro colorado it's it's a great bro you gotta find look
up like the if you just type in horseshoe theory idg podcast she explains it great that there's a
school in colorado who had uh play nights on their playground it was children of color only play night
see that's and it's segregation so and they were like and they they interviewed the the
elementary school about it like why did you guys do this we're like we wanted to be inclusive to
you know the families of color and we wanted no white children to be there because we wanted it to
be like the parents of color so they could interact better and be more open with each other
that's some shit they just did and uh i was reading an article about some college where uh can i get
a movie yeah where um they're doing like the premiere of the new black panther and like no
white kids were invited hey what the fuck right yeah it's a it's a weird idea right it's like
i could see what they're trying to do but it don't really make sense at all at all
yeah but you heard what i was saying about uh that that college where they like had the premiere
of black panther and they didn't want any white kids there no stupid shit i never heard about that
what college was that i'm probably some college with not a lot of money
but it's like bro like once motherfuckers understand that we all humans that's it
can you find a skeletal remain and know if they were black or white
a skeleton i mean not i know i can you find a skeletal remain and know if they were black or
white or mexican outside of size yeah i don't think so probably not so i'm saying man i don't
yeah i'm gonna find this video it's fucking it's worth it the fuck do it matter for
i look at you as a human yeah at the end of the day bro like racism came for
racism came from bro youtube fucking like shadow bandit or something because i can't
fucking find it probably but racism came from a competition of resources
yeah just some sort of a position of power over somebody yeah you understand apocalypto
yeah i saw that in the movie theater when i was a kid bro i'll never forget that that movie was
i remember watching that movie in the movie theater i didn't know what it was about even i went with
this girl it was crazy what a what a meaning deep meaningful movie and shit people of their same
color came and did that shit to them yeah that dude it's fucking is your biggest enemy really
somebody with a different skin complexion i don't think so yeah especially in the black community
who's likely and it's just like statistically who's likely to end your existence as a black person
another black person who's likely to rob you who's likely to steal from you like
and that's why i just don't get caught up in that shit yeah find just google uh
sorry i'm like on a different wavelength right now google that the uh school in colorado that
movie was sick school in colorado that had like uh play night for children of color only
i think i remember hearing this i wouldn't even take my daughter there and i hate colorado
because you hate colorado now the two bro oh yeah i'm gonna fucks me up i got altitude sickness
there me too bro what about the people that did take their kids there that night well like what
type of people are are they denver elementary school spacing backlash for planning a families
of color playground read the fucking sign how crazy you put that these are these are the same
what guy put those letters up there on that sign these are these are the same
people that would take their kids to a drag brunch a drag brunch you didn't see that i remember
no yeah yeah he knows yeah he finally dragged that they brought like drag queens to the school
for the kids or some shit oh my god bro that's fucking insane i would not show up to that
school is that man my daughter loves all people of color both of my daughters people of all colors
where are your daughters live in la yeah activist pimps mom's blast school board for promoting
family friendly halloween drag show yeah bro i think that i just think the pendulum is gonna
swing on this wacky shit man i think it's just gonna swing back and kind of get normal you saw
that fucking non-binary person that works for biden yes still in some cases oh my god bro
that was so fucking that person is a very weird looking person at first said it was an accident

people because they're like non-binary or because they were dressed his fucking the black lady the
the Haitian that works for him is what a lesbian i have is she i don't know yeah and she is she gets
ate up at the white house correspondence i saw this old clip of joe biden when he was a lot younger

like totally switched he said some fucked up shit about the war on drugs too he said some
fucked up shit about black people like totally daughters right well his daughters about black
guys yeah maybe it was in front of congress but he like full on said the n-word in front of congress
like decades ago um they just change it up bro i fucking change their words but they don't change
their essence no yeah it's all for the money yeah that's it yeah whatever the flavor of the
fucking year is they just go along with it if we do it right in america we reelect trump in 2024
you think that's the right thing to do really and then elect desantis 2028 23 shout out you really
think it'll be good if they elect trump again yeah really why because bro he ain't you don't think he's
kind of he don't give a fuck about either side he really doesn't he really yeah yeah he'll shake
shit up bro he'll he'll at the least he shakes it up yeah he makes you figure shit out at least
how much unity was there under trump's presidency unity it was better than right now
i feel like there was more than vision at least yeah but you had two strong sides now it just seems
like yeah trump nobody even respects any there might have been more unity like you had with the right
and the left might have each been unified together but there was definitely now you just got you just
got a pawn a dirty pond of nothing now everybody hates biden yeah i mean nobody nobody defends
biden back when trump was president you only had anti trumpers and trumpers right exactly right i'm
cool with an anti-trump you don't like money dog yeah how much is gas around this way four how much
was it two years ago 250 yeah two and change okay has has has your wages increased that much

was president there was kids not kids but there was people like on youtube independent journalists

more numbers more revenue than ever before because of trump because he was just feeding them all that
meat he's a beast yes man he is pretty wild i go see a trump one-man show yeah 100 1200 tickets
