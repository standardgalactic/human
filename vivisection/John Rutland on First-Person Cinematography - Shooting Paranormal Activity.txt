watch yeah right go go down a little bit roll down a little down a little down right in there now
just tilt up ready and action my name is John Rutland I'm a cinematographer I'm here in Tampa
Florida shooting a bush gardens commercial the producer director of the commercial is Rob Cowie
he and I have done two movies together he's one of the producers of the Blair Witch Project and
Lovely Molly was my first film that I did with them and then we did Exis recently I've done a
handful of features and I just wrapped a few weeks ago the newest paranormal activity movie
yeah what are you doing in here
I got into filmmaking through photography mostly I took a
like a beginning photography class my first year of undergrad and then thought I needed to get like
a practical kind of degree from from university so I got like a business degree and then after
that I realized that I didn't want to do anything else I just wanted to go into film for whatever
reason I just decided to go through the film school route not that you need to do that like
anybody can can go through different avenues to like ultimately come into film but as a DP like
they expect you to be kind of like the foundation or one of the pillars of the whole production
right and they expect you to be able to deliver be quick when you're lighting and and you know
stick to the schedule and be able to basically just deliver right so um so like you have to work
up towards certain budgets no one's going to give a DP as their first feature like a 25 million
dollar movie because they need to like basically prove at the lower budget levels that they can
deliver and then work their way up Katie, Kirstie, I want you to concentrate concentrate
I need you to concentrate. Paranormal activity is like a weird animal just because it's it's a
bigger budget like it's it's the biggest budget movie that I've worked on by far but like they
they treat it like a low budget movie and that's one of the things that's really interesting about
it like there's no big like trucks with gear like they kind of hide everything in the backyard of
the houses so they very much even though it's a studio making the movie they want they they
actively try to avoid having it feel like a big studio movie and they try and keep things small
in a way it it felt like you know an independent movie you know even though it is a studio movie
and there's definitely a studio presence since that's more my background you know independent
movies thus far it was felt like a pretty smooth transition and they have like an interesting
process on paranormal where they they shoot for a period of time and then they kind of stop down
and edit and see what they have and see what direction they want the movie to go and and then
make some adjustments reshoot some stuff and then start shooting like the next part of the movie so
we were basically like on and off for like eight months one of the main differences between shooting
a traditional kind of third-person movie versus shooting a first-person movie is like when i'm
operating in a first-person movie it's like you're operating but you're also acting and it's it's a
weird thing to like wrap your head around initially but you know because that camera is the point of
view of the character who has the camera you also have to like as you're operating and seeing things
you know you have to act basically and like the camera needs to react and it can't be you know it's
got to be subtle and it can't be cheesy it's like you're not like shaking your head yes and no or
whatever or something stupid like that but like you know as you especially with like the scary
movies which a lot of times the uh the first-person movies end up being like horror movies but with
those it's like when you come around you see something it's like you have to kind of register
that you're startled the camera is like it's creating a feeling you know as it's moving through the
scene whether it's a traditional movie or a first-person movie if the shot if the intention is to
create tension in the shot then it needs to move in a certain way at a certain speed and follow a
character in a specific way so there's definitely aspects that are the same but you know and then
also from like a lighting standpoint there's realistic lighting in like a fictional narrative
movie like a third traditional third person movie and you can have like very naturalistic and
realistic lighting but if you use that same lighting in like a first-person movie it still
feels false so like there's got to be something messier and more real and the cameras aren't
holding every little bit of detail from the highlights to the shadows like a little bit
sloppy so like somebody watching a first-person movie if they're like wow I really love the
cinematography in that movie in a way it's like you've kind of failed as a DP because you know
the cinematography really shouldn't draw attention to itself in a movie like that it should feel
as if it's 100 real the last movie that Rob and I did together um was exist and that was like a
first person um you know found footage big foot movie so these guys go out into the woods and they
kind of encounter big foot
you gotta be kidding me man
I went out and I bought one of these bad boys we're gonna have the best youtube video ever
it's okay there's nothing out here
okay
a lot of times like we found that the best way to go about it was to have the actors operate
because they are like they're completely immersed in the scene and they're like bringing something
that um that me as a DP may not think to do whether it's like the framing is a bit off because
they're not focused on the framing they're focused on the person that they're talking to so like
you know their head might be cut off in a weird way but it's kind of interesting and it kind of
works for the scene you know or they may think to pan off like somebody has a bunch of dialogue and
they may think to just pan off and go look at something else where you know my my instinct
would be to like stay on the person who's speaking you know so it's like a lot of times what we did
is we would have the actors operate the first couple of takes and then I would come in and
basically just like clean up what they did
and this is going to go tumbling around inside the camper
I guess one piece of advice I would have for like younger filmmakers or kind of people coming up
is just to like go and do it and it doesn't matter your background or your experience level or
anything like that like it's just you know I think you know life rewards those who just go out and do
it you know so rather than like you know a lot of times I find myself waiting like I have a camera
I have the sony a7s and lenses like there's nothing stopping me from like going out and shooting
anything that I want right but a lot of times I'm like well I don't have the perfect lens or I don't
have the perfect this or I don't have the perfect that so then I don't go and do it but then there's
people with even less stuff will go out and make something incredible you know so it's like
you know you kind of just you just have to go out and do it basically
