Hello world!
Today's guest is Chapelle Lacy.
Chapelle is a hilarious comedian based in Los Angeles.
You can check him out on his podcast called It's Managed, and he's also on the Fighter and the Kid podcast with Brandon Schaub.
Without further ado, please welcome Chapelle Lacy.
Boom! Yo, Chapelle Lacy, thanks for coming down here to Florida.
Thanks for having me.
This is super cool to have you on here.
Yeah, this is great. I like your setup.
So for people out there who aren't familiar, just tell me a little bit about your background and how you got in to stand up and everything you do.
Stand up? I got in because it was basically a dare. Someone dared me.
A dare?
Yeah, I used to drink real heavy, you know, seven years off of that shit.
How old are you by the way?
33.
33, okay. We're the same age.
Oh, hell yeah. You do not look 33.
I know. 1987, baby.
January?
July.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, close enough.
Yeah, I was in college. I was cheering at a University of Louisville out in Kentucky.
My friends used to play these acoustic sets at bars and we used to go see them all the time.
It was like every Monday night we'd go see them.
One night they were playing and they called me up on stage and they just wanted me to fucking say something.
So the only thing I knew was just to say something funny.
It wasn't like even my intention, but it was just like, well, I can't come up here and just talk.
You know, like when it was fucking, you know, give a speech or something.
So I just told like a funny story and, you know, people were dying and then someone was like,
man, you should get in to stand up.
And I was like, I don't fucking know anything about stand up.
The only stand up I really knew at the time was Eddie Murphy Raw.
Dave Chappelle's killing him softly and Kings of Comedy.
There was only ones that like fucking like strongly knew.
But I didn't think that was like something like anyone could do.
I didn't think it was like, oh, like, you know, anyone could just fucking be a stand up comedian.
I thought you like, you know, there's a lot more to it.
You practice that whole life.
Yeah, I thought it was like something you, you know, especially knowing like,
because what Dave Chappelle started when he was like 15, so did Eddie Murphy.
So like, I just thought that was like, oh, that's, you know, that's something you got to like get into like early on.
And, you know, and I used to be this, you know, drunk where like, you know, I was to say I won't drunk.
You know, that was the guy was just waiting to get there.
Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't say I won't do it.
And someone was like, yeah, someone was like, you should try comedy.
I was like, I don't know anything about it.
No, yeah, you won't do it.
I was like, say I won't.
And then literally, you know, found an open mic.
But like, before I did that, before I even found the open mic, actually, to backtrack,
I've studied it for like two months straight, just like to understand it, you know,
like what was like, what the fuck's going on?
Like, I don't know anything about it.
So I would just, I would just watch comedy, like everybody, like from, you know,
big names to random clips on YouTube, you know, I just, I just watch it just to see
what the fuck I was getting myself into.
Right.
And when I tried it, you know, I was blown away.
I was like, oh, shit.
Fuck school.
I can maybe do this.
Yeah, I was like, you know, I was like, I was like, I enjoyed that.
And I was like, and what I did, you know, that was the most studying I've done for
something, you know, like I studied harder for that than I did with school.
Yeah.
So I was like, yeah, why would I, why would I do that, you know, to myself, you know,
like, why would I try to be somewhere where I just don't give a fuck?
Yeah, I just don't care to be around it.
Yeah.
And, you know, that was in 2010.
And then once I did that, man, that's why I was like, oh, okay, let's fucking, let's
roll with it.
When you were trying to learn it, was there like a point in time where you had sort of
an epiphany to like, did you like ever reach a certain point where like, oh, I get it now.
Like, you know what, actually, I stopped for two years after my brother passed away back
in, he passed away in 2013.
And I want to say I, in 2000, like all of 2014, 2015, I didn't really do it.
But in 2016, when I got back up, because the friends were just like, they're like, hey,
you're going up tonight, you know.
And, you know, before they had said that, there was a lot of people asking me to do
shows, and I kept, you know, just turning people down.
I'm like, no, I don't want to do it.
I don't want to do it.
And then when they were like, oh, you're going up.
I was like, oh, shit, you know, he's guessing I'm going to have a choice.
And, you know, that was the first time, like, you know, I said, like, real shit, you know
what I mean?
And people fucked with it.
And like, laughs.
Because, you know, prior to that, like, the stuff I was writing before, you know, was
just goofy stuff and trying to like, I was really trying to be funny.
Yeah.
I was like pushing, like, it was like so forced, you know, say this stupid thing.
Yeah.
Say that stupid thing because it's stupid.
You know, but like it, I didn't have no connection to it.
Right.
You know, whereas like when I got back up, you know, there was a connection to this shit.
It was real.
It was real to me.
Some feeling in it.
There was some feeling.
There was a lot more meaning behind it.
Yeah.
And I felt better about being on stage because of it.
You know, I think, I think, you know, before I had quit, you know, it stopped.
I think I was just writing off this dare, you know, that someone, you know, I was writing
off that dare of like, yeah, someone dared me to do this.
But then, you know, getting back on, that's when it like fucking, yeah, I was like, oh,
shit.
Yeah, this is what I should be doing.
That's cool.
And then it just fucking, you know, I just worked my ass off this back home in Arizona.
You're originally from Arizona.
Yeah.
I moved back home after I started comedy in the global.
Yeah, I was like,
I just left college and
Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah.
Hell yeah.
And I do not regret that.
Fuck college.
Well, not for everybody, you know.
Yeah.
Love college if you love college, but fuck college for people like me.
Yeah.
For most people, most people fuck college, unless you're going to be a doctor, unless you have
to get a degree.
Unless you like got a fucking, I mean, I know so many people with great jobs that fucking
do not have a college degree.
Right.
Oh yeah, for sure.
Yeah.
You just start working for a company or whatever that does what you want to do and you just
start at the bottom and work your way up.
That's the best way to learn.
Oh yeah.
One of my friends, I think he's doing like 150 grand a year or something like that.
A year fucking high school diploma.
Wow.
You know, working for like a, you know, something with fucking accounting, I don't know.
He's just like understood the, you know, just, you know, works his way up like literally
from the bottom and just understood the fucking business.
So it's like, yeah, the person's fucking good.
Your name for everybody, you don't got to go to college.
Yeah, you can find your way.
Yeah.
You can find your fucking way.
Absolutely.
And he ain't got no fucking student loans to pay off or anything like that.
He don't owe Sally May, you know.
Yeah.
You know.
Dude, so that gymnastic shit that you do, I watched some videos on your Instagram.
Wow.
And you like to see a dude your size, just do a standing still backflip is pretty fucking
mind blowing.
Yeah, it is.
That shit is wild, bro.
How did you get so good at that?
I've been doing essence.
I was like five.
Really?
Well, not the, not the cheerleading.
So is it?
So it's, it's actual cheerleading.
Okay.
Competitive cheerleading.
Competitive cheerleading.
So I started cheerleading when I was like 15.
But yeah, like prior to that, I just loved martial art films, man.
Yeah.
And so I'd see that shit.
And I'd see them doing all the flips.
And I was like, oh, I can fucking do that.
Yeah, right.
What little kid doesn't want to be able to do that?
I was like, I think I can fucking do this.
Yeah.
And then, and then, yeah, straight up, I just like fucking started trying it outside.
And then, you know, I just got better and better at it.
And then, you know, I had a crush on this girl.
That's how it all starts.
Every good movie.
Every good movie.
Yeah.
It was Crush on the Girl.
Yeah.
I was outside of her house with a fucking boom box.
Yeah.
You know what's so funny?
I've never even seen that movie.
I just know that scene.
I just know that one part.
What is that?
The notebook?
No.
It's a fucking, it's an old movie.
I forget the name of it.
Yeah.
Classic.
Classic, though.
Yeah.
It's not like a classic movie.
Yeah.
And a competitive cheerleading.
Well, I didn't want to get into it.
Oh, you're just chasing the chick.
Yeah.
She was in there.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
And she saw me do the flips and shit, so she asked me to join, and I was like, fuck
yeah, let's go.
There's this dude on TikTok.
I forget.
I don't remember what his name is, but he's got like a, probably an eight-year-old
daughter.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Have you seen him?
Mm-hmm.
And they'll do it stand in their living room and like she'll be standing on his
hand and he'll like flip her up.
She's like 10 flips and lands back on his hands.
Yeah.
That shit is wild.
It was wild, man.
You have to like eat shit, I'm sure, a lot of times practicing that shit.
You know what?
I don't think I ate shit that crazy.
Really?
Yeah.
You know?
Like, how do you get to that point?
I mean, I can't.
You know what I mean?
Like, how do you?
I've eaten shit, but like not, you know.
Not real, real bad.
Yeah, because there's so much like with progressions.
Yeah.
And like, you learn how to fall.
Mm-hmm.
You know, so like, because you start to have a body awareness.
The people that eat shit have no fucking body awareness.
They don't know how to fall.
They don't know how to fall.
They don't know what the fuck they're doing.
Yeah.
They don't know how to fall.
You know?
Yeah, sometimes it's out of your control.
Yeah.
You know, where you, you know, it's like, oh, I can't do shit about this.
Let's just fall.
But, you know, a lot of times, you know, it's just, it's fucking, I don't know.
There's, there's progressions to it.
Right.
You kind of know your limit.
Yeah.
You know your limit and you know, like, what you're capable of and like, you know, there's
so many drills that progress you to like the next skill.
So you never, you know, out of your comfort zone with it because, you know, you've done
these steps.
And so it's like, oh, now I'm able to fully do it.
You know, that's how it, that's how it is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, it just seems, it seems hard to like wrap my mind around how you like incrementally
progress to that level.
Yeah.
To where you're doing like 10 flips on someone's hand.
You know.
I mean, I get it like skateboarding.
You can jump into a foam pit.
You know what I mean?
You can launch a huge ramp, practice something into a foam pit, but to be able to do something
like literally standing on somebody's hand with no, nothing below you.
I mean, I guess they practice above maths and shit for a long time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You practice on that shit a lot before you take it to the video.
But yeah, I mean, yeah, I just worked my ass off.
You know, I was the same way with, with skateboarding, you know, I loved skateboarding and all I did
was just, you know, I don't know.
It wasn't even like I wanted to work my ass off.
It's just, I just liked it.
Mm-hmm.
Like if it's like, if I do something that I really like.
You do it every day all day.
Oh man.
I lock into it.
Yeah.
And it's because it's just like, it's, it's like fun to me.
Like, you know, I would, you know, thinking about like, yeah, hard work.
Yeah.
I work hard just naturally, you know, but I think, you know, I mean, yeah, you look at
some guys like, you know, like you look at like a Kobe Bryant or LeBron James or, you
know, you look at these guys that are just like these freak of athletes, but, you know,
their work ethic is fucking insane.
Yeah, it's great.
You know, like, it's like, yeah, they could, they could still suck.
They have the fucking ability to suck, but you know, I know, I know that, you know, you
know, those guys have like a little bit of help, you know what I mean?
Like, you know, with natural physiques, but at the same time, they could still suck at
it.
Right.
You know what I mean?
They could still like, they're still capable.
Yeah.
Their mind has to be 100% full.
Yeah.
It's like, okay, I got this gift.
Right.
What do I do with it?
You know what I mean?
Like just fucking let it be a gift or take the gift above and beyond.
Right.
You know what I mean?
Are you an NBA fan?
Uh, well, once I quit cheer, I started watching basketball.
Okay.
So you watched just, you watched this year's finals.
Uh, I actually didn't see this year's, uh, finals.
Okay.
Cause I don't fucking, I'm fucking TV.
They want me to pay an extra for this.
Yeah.
It apparently had like the lowest viewership of all time.
Yeah.
I saw that.
That's pretty weird.
Yeah.
It is pretty weird.
I mean, there's a lots of playing account, man.
I mean, who knows?
The bubble, the virus.
Who knows?
I mean, I was, I was fucking locked into it just like I was every year.
Yeah.
I know it is weird, man.
Like it's just a weird time for everybody.
Like no one knows.
The whole world is weird, man.
Like no one fucking knows the correct answer, but everyone acts like they fucking do.
Yeah.
You know, that's the funny thing about a lot of shit and just watching people.
Literally.
Like they got the answer.
Yeah.
I go, do you fucking know?
You fucking know.
Right.
Nobody has a fucking real vague answer or some shit about everything.
Dude, it boggles my fucking mind.
There's no question at all.
Yeah.
I'm like some, like shit that like some of my friends like say to me, I go, how did
you come up with that?
Yeah.
Like I fucking know you.
Yeah.
I know what you do daily.
Right.
Now you're a doctor or a scientist and shit.
What did you watch?
Dude.
Yeah.
It's literally the weirdest shit.
Well, they're saying this.
They're saying this.
No one fucking knows.
Yeah.
No one fucking has the accurate answer.
You know, because everywhere is fucking different.
You know what I mean?
Who knows?
Like, I mean, like that's one thing.
Like I'm just such a geek of learning.
Right.
You know, I don't, I don't walk around.
Like I would hate to walk around acting like I know.
Right.
Spitting.
That's not the truth.
Exactly.
You know what I mean?
It looks so dumb.
Yeah.
I don't like that shit.
I don't like walking around like I fucking like, oh, I know this.
Yeah.
Right.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
You always got to assume that the person you're talking to knows something you don't.
Right.
Yeah.
Exactly.
And I like, I learned that from a, I'm a big Henry Rawlins geek.
You know.
And I don't know who Henry Rawlins is.
All right.
I'll see you guys later.
Who is he?
Henry Rawlins.
Yeah.
It was in bands, movies.
Yeah.
Kind of a beauty guy.
Yeah.
He was in Black Flag.
That's why I do that.
Yeah.
No, no, you're good.
No, that's awesome.
You're good.
You're good.
You're just the first person I've ever heard of.
He's, he does a lot of spoken word.
Like a, you know, human rights activists now.
Okay.
He was in bands.
But like, he's one of those dudes.
He just, he's just, he wants to be tuned in.
He wants to learn.
Okay.
He wants to educate himself.
Like he doesn't walk around like he knows everything.
Right.
He just wants to learn.
And I, those are the people like that I look up to and appreciate because, you know, he
doesn't talk like he's capped off.
He talks, he talks as if he's like wanting to know more.
Those are the people like I fuck with, you know what I mean?
So I've gotten rid of all my friends.
Yo, for real, man.
But yeah, like, I mean,
How annoying is it when you get in a room with somebody and they're just, they're just
like preaching to you.
Just like telling you how it is about everything.
Oh dude, I'm like, yeah.
I'm like, what?
Just like this fucking guy.
Yeah.
No, it's, it's the most annoying shit.
It's like, if there's one thing that really bugs me, it's that.
Right.
You know what I mean?
I go, how do you, like, how am I supposed to trust you?
Like, I mean.
I argue with people like that.
Yeah.
I think about a lot.
I mean, everything's fucking, you know, wild in this world, right?
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.
Naturally.
It's going to fucking happen.
It's going to be wild.
You know, there's, there's so, there's so much, um, difference in the world.
But what I think, you know, a lot of us don't realize, you know, I travel a lot and go,
a lot of us are fucking same more than we actually think, you know, it's, it's, it's,
it's like people want to explain more of something else than themselves.
That's the thing that fucking, you know, like boggles my mind, you know, people want to
tell you about this or tell you about another person or tell you how you are, but couldn't
even explain themselves.
That's the wildest shit to me.
That's the shit I think about on the regular.
I read a lot of fucking stoicism books.
Well, not books.
Like, well, yeah, fuck, yeah, fucks with stoicism a lot.
Yeah.
You know, it's just intriguing.
I think, you know, I've just seen the best result from it, you know, by, uh, you know,
following it because it's a lot of it is like being in tune with you, who you are.
And like what I've come to realize with, you know, jumping into that world is that like,
yeah, I don't, you know, necessarily go after people or like anyone else or I don't make
things about anyone else but myself.
You know what I mean?
Like one of the biggest situations, you know, I grew up, I grew up with an abusive stepfather,
you know, and I'm one of those rare cases where, you know, it doesn't, I don't have
like any ill will towards them or I don't want to like go after them.
You know what I mean?
I don't want to go.
Right.
This guy fucking wronged me for 17 years.
You know, let me, now, now I'd need, you know, justice from this.
You know what I mean?
I don't want that.
You know, I decided to, you know, I had to go through years of anger management also,
which is another big help.
And, you know, I just, there was so much like realization.
I mean, there were so many things that were said that didn't really click with me until
like later years.
You know, because I'll, you know, my last anger management class was, I think it was 22 last
time.
When you were 22.
When you were 22.
Yeah, when I was 22.
So, you know, it's, it's a, I, you know, there's just, they just sent a lot of intriguing things.
One of the biggest things that, you know, that was said to me, but I didn't catch it
till later was when, you know, my anger management teacher, we were talking.
I was like, yeah, I don't have any, I don't have any confidence because of my, you know,
because of the way my step, step dad treated me.
And he was like, what?
He goes, it has nothing to do with him.
He goes, it's your confidence.
He goes, are you around him now?
Or is he, is he here right now?
No.
He's like, it's your confidence.
And I didn't really get that at first, you know, you know, because I was just so young
and wild.
And then, you know, years later I clicked with me.
I was like, oh yeah.
I was like, so I don't need to make anything about him anymore.
Right.
I was like, I can.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was like, I don't have to make anything about him.
Why do I need to like have this energy of like hate, you know, towards them?
You know what I mean?
And, you know, and I thought even deeper, I was like, you know, there were things that
happened to him when he was younger.
You know, he was doing what he knew, you know, that was all he knew.
He was just in that environment.
Right.
So I had to put all that into consideration to forgive this person and forgive him with
love because there's a difference.
You know, I think there's a difference of forgiving someone with, you know, just saying,
oh, I forgive you.
Right.
That's easy to say and walking away.
But to forgive a person with love means like, damn, this person, that person that is forgiving
with love is pretty in control of who they are.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
You have this like.
Yeah.
When you, when you hold, when you hold, I feel like when you hold a grudge towards someone
like that, like when you have some stuff that goes on in your early life like that,
like abuse from like a step parent or something like that.
Yeah.
When you're older, it's easy to use them as an excuse for shit or like hold like that,
that angst or hatred towards them.
100%.
But you're the one that suffers, not them.
Yeah.
When you're, when you feel like that and you think like that, you're making yourself suffer.
Oh yeah.
100%.
And once you can let go of that, then there's no more suffering.
You're completely clear of it and you have no, you have no hard feelings or whatever.
You almost want to thank them for making you turn out the way you did.
Oh dude.
100%.
So right now it's shake his hand.
Right.
You know?
Just cause it, I mean, you know, with all that I've learned and I'm so happy that, you
know, I've, I've had these, you know, certain people that I look up to and admire to help
me find things for myself.
You know what I mean?
Um, just, just finding that like in the result I've seen from, from it has been like wonderful
for me.
I've like, I walk through life a lot smoother now.
You know, most people, like when I tell people I went through, you know, anger management,
most people, they don't even fucking believe it.
You know, I go, that's how hard I've worked.
You know what I mean?
That's what I like, or just I've learned so much.
I've taken in so much because it's, it's, it's yeah, like, you know, I see these people
every day, you know, and I get it, you know, sometimes, you know, within reason, you know,
I see these people wanting to go after people online, you know, a person does something,
you know, like one of the weirdest things that I saw was, uh, you guys know the actress
of Vanessa Hudgens?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So she posted a picture of her at a, at a cemetery and said, it said, my happy place.
Right.
And someone got offended that she said that because she was at a cemetery and they're
like, Oh my God, I can't believe you're doing this.
Yeah.
And it's like, you, I'm like, you know, you, you needed to do that.
You needed to go to her fucking page and page and say that, like, how are you okay?
Right.
You know, that's like my first thought to people like that.
Are you okay?
Who hurt you?
What do you have going on?
Yeah.
What do you have going on?
You know what I mean?
Because that's, that's, that's, you know, to, they don't understand.
Yeah.
Like you're making, you're, you're making your, um, you know, her picture is not about
you.
Right.
Has nothing to do with you.
But people do that.
People make these other things about them.
Yeah.
Because the most terrifying thing that people is to look within.
Yeah.
People are scared to do that.
Yeah.
Fucking scary.
But once you do it, you know, oh, you fucking come out better.
With anger management, did you ever do any writing like it was writing a process of that?
You journal every day.
Yeah.
Now when you like explain to me like your process with journaling versus like writing
for comedy, is there, is there a difference between the two or is there an overlap?
Not even really.
It's not even a difference.
I mean, the journal goes on stage pretty much.
Really?
Yeah.
Because that's where I make it so honest and so clear to where I can understand it.
And when I have a clear view of it, what I say on stage, like, it's just like, you know,
I know what to say with it and know how to make it funny because I understand it.
Mm hmm.
You know what I mean?
Like that's, that's the thing with it.
Like I tell jokes about my abuse of childhood, you know, because and, and it's, and it's
a tough joke because obviously when people hear the word abuse, they get uncomfortable,
you know, and I literally had to like bomb that joke a lot.
Fuck.
You know what I mean?
Think about it.
Yeah.
And, you know, I really had to figure out a way, you know, and one of the things that
I had to learn, I was like, don't say this out of spite, there's a crowd to get uncomfortable
because they could feel that they'll know that you're not okay.
You know what I mean?
So it's like, okay, don't say this out of spite.
How do I say this out of like, I'm having fun with it.
You know what I mean?
And I lead it up, you know, to that.
I get them prepared for it.
Mm hmm.
You know what I mean?
But in funny ways.
And then I just fucking drop it on them and then, and then it fucking they appreciate it
because I made them comfortable with it.
You know what I mean?
I let them know where I'm at, but I let them know where I'm at in such a funny way in such
a cool way, too.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
And that was all from like journaling about it constantly, just constantly writing about,
you know, what that, you know, childhood was like and where I'm at now, you know, and
when I do that and let them know where I'm at now and how I am mentally, it sets them
up like, oh, okay, okay, I guess we can ride with this, you know.
And, you know, I mean, what that just doing that and what it's done for me has made me
realize so much.
You know what I mean?
I think a lot about like.
About yourself, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Everything, you know, gosh, and it's, it's, it's, you know, it's hard to say, you know,
not even hard.
It's not hard to say.
It just doesn't, it's just not something that clicks with people very easy, not an easy
thing to just sit there and tell someone like, hey, I know that person wronged you, but
don't make it about them.
Make it about you.
Take control.
But, but I mean, that's hard to get someone to understand that.
It's very hard.
You know, so I get it sometimes, you know, like, I mean, you know, I want, I was lashing
out at everybody, but with violence, you know, I always wanted to fight, you know, because
that's all I knew.
All I knew was violence.
That's all I saw in my house.
So when I would go outside, what did it, what was I doing?
I wanted, you know, violence.
So, you know, yeah, I do get it.
A lot of people are doing what they know, but a lot of people need to realize, you know,
most of the time, what someone else is doing has nothing to do with you and I don't take
that abuse personal.
I don't take it personal at all.
Why?
You know, yeah, he was doing what he knew, like his, like he, he thinks he, you know,
was a great dad.
Of course.
That's not crazy.
We don't know why it's not crazy because his dad left him.
He didn't know his father, you know what I mean?
So he was there in my life.
Yeah, he was there.
He was there.
That's a big difference.
It's a big difference.
I'm not being there.
Yeah.
Exactly.
So, you know, why would I think it's crazy when, when he would say that he thinks he
was a, you know, he tried his best.
He's right.
He tried his best and that was what he, what he gave.
You know what I mean?
You know, and I still see him from time to time.
You know, it was, it was been like, I haven't seen him in like four years, you know, but
I have a brother with special needs.
So my mom and him still have to see each other, like take him, you know, the doctor's appointment
or, you know, whatever, whatever they need to do to, to help him out.
And you know, a lot of times, you know, it's, there's not much conversation there.
And on my end, I'm okay.
I'm like, yeah, I'll talk to you, you know, but I think, you know, I don't, I don't know
as to why it's not like, you know, I don't want to talk to you.
It's more of like, I don't know what to say, you know, I mean, which is fine.
I get it.
There's a lot of shit.
You know, I think, and I think the cooler story would be, you know, to have a conversation
with him.
Yeah.
Why not?
Fuck it.
Who cares?
Right.
We'll see where it goes.
Yeah.
It goes bad.
Okay.
I'm cool with me.
You know, I love what I'm doing.
I'm having fun with life, you know, so.
It's amazing how much writing and journaling like about yourself or just like recalling
past experiences and stuff, organizing, how, you know, doing that helps you like organize
your thoughts and helps you like better articulate what you've experienced or what you're thinking
about or help, helps you communicate it to people.
And it just like, it's such a benefit to people to be able to do that.
Like, especially if you have things like, if you have problems with anger or if, you
know, violence or whatever it may be, being able to express that and actually like get
it organized out of your mind and articulate it onto paper and talk about it.
Yeah.
I feel like, man, that's such a huge benefit.
Yeah.
I mean, and it's so hard.
I get it.
It's fucking hard.
I mean, look how long it fucking took me.
Right.
Right.
You know, it's tough, you know.
Now, did the process or the discipline that you've started of journaling, did that come
from the anger management or did that come from the comedy?
You know, I, you know, so when my brother passed, I started journaling a lot, you know, but
then I stopped.
Okay.
I started, I just ripped out all the pages and threw it away because I couldn't really
look at it, you know.
And then once I moved to LA in 2018, that's when I started really doing it.
That's when I really started fucking journaling because I was like, because yeah, I was like,
I was like, I don't know this city or anything about it.
Everyone, you know, claims to know how LA is, you know, but a lot of times I'm like,
you know, you've never lived there, you know, I've never lived there.
You never lived there.
You're never going off as a visitor, you know what I mean?
So when I, when I moved there, you know, that's when I really got back into it because, you
know, you got a lot of, I mean, you know, many people are trying to be comedians.
I can imagine, especially in LA, right?
You know, many people are trying to be actors.
You know, many people are trying to be something out there.
So fucking much.
People want to make it.
People want to fucking make it, you know.
I mean, I was, I was one of those, you know, I just was like, man, fuck it.
Why don't I just go out, you know, and work and just like, why don't I just go, okay,
I just simplified it and got rid of all the fucking pressures of trying to make it.
So that's an insane, that's a big fucking, I mean, especially in that world, because
if you don't make it, because it's not, it's not a guarantee.
You're setting yourself up for failure.
Oh yeah.
You're going to set yourself up for it.
You're going to go crazy.
You know, I didn't want to fucking do that.
It's like a rat race out there.
Oh my God.
Everyone trying to, everyone trying to become famous.
Everyone's trying to become famous.
Yeah.
And people don't know how to be their, their most authentic self.
Yeah.
And I was like, well, everyone's doing that.
I'm one of those dudes that like, there's this fucking cesspool shit going on.
Yeah, yeah.
I go, ah, let me, you know, I look around like, I'm like, nah, I don't want to go over there.
Right.
Let me do it like this.
You know, like I said, it was one of those things like, I'm not going to fucking act,
because people go there acting like they know.
Right.
Because if they act like they know, then they think that people were like, oh yeah, this
guy knows what's up.
This girl knows what's up.
They're trying to act like somebody that really not even yet.
Exactly.
You know, I'm like, I'm not doing that.
I don't know shit.
All right.
Yeah.
I don't know shit.
Fuck it.
My biggest thing with those people is just like, what if you just run into somebody who actually
does know all who has an experience or who can like open doors for you, you show up and
you act and like you you're trying to preach to them, they're never going to fucking talk
to you.
No, yeah.
You're a joker.
Yeah.
Yeah, I go, I don't fucking, yeah, whatever.
So how did you get your initially get your foot in the door to like the comedy scene?
I mean, you're pretty like well entrenched with like all the big comics in L.A. right
now.
How did you enter that world?
How did you get your like your big break, if you will?
Yeah.
I mean, uh, so yeah, I'm trying to think of like the best way to explain it.
I just started doing, I just started doing me.
Okay.
And I was going out and doing like open mics.
Yeah.
Just going out and doing it.
Then people thought I was funny.
They would ask me to be on shows and it just kept building from there because shows you
mean just like open mic shows.
So like not the open mic show.
So like open mics to like actual booked shows.
Oh, wow.
Yeah.
Like, yeah.
And the thing was like, I was like, I learned this from like Dave Grohl, you know,
Foo Fighters guy?
Yeah.
He was like, if you're loud enough, people will fucking hear it.
And he goes, he goes, uh, like when he drummed for Nirvana, he was just like, if you're loud
enough, people will fucking hear it, you know, and I thought about that.
And I was like, yeah, if you're loud enough, people will hear it.
So if you, if you're good enough, people will fucking hear it.
They're going to come.
Yeah.
They're going to come.
They're going to come.
I promise you.
And you know, a lot of times you see people like, man, like, I can't believe I'm not getting
this.
I'm not getting this.
I'm not getting, you know, it's like, well, you can keep fucking saying that.
They focus on the numbers.
They're like, yeah.
And it's like, dude, fuck it.
Fuck it.
Don't use that as a fucking excuse.
Yeah.
I hate that shit.
So fucking.
Yeah.
I don't want to make an excuse as to why they're not getting something.
Fucking do you just be, just exist.
Exist loudly.
I can't start my podcast yet because I don't have enough subscribers yet.
Yeah.
I can't start it until I have a thousand subscribers.
Yeah.
I, you know, oh, this place doesn't, you know, book, you know, book me because of this or
you know, weird shit like that and it's like, yeah, and it's like, man, if you, you know,
I just realized you suck.
Yeah.
Maybe it's not what you think it is.
It's not the place.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think about this shit all the time.
I think about a lot of shit, you know, just fucking very, you know, introspective.
Is that the word I'm looking for?
Introspective.
Yeah.
And yeah, I just do a lot of so much of looking within that, you know, and it's so funny because
I'm on.
I feel like the smartest people do that.
I appreciate that.
That's a compliment.
Well, I mean, they do.
I mean, the smartest people I've met, they are like that and they spend a lot of time
writing and journaling.
That's why I'm always curious about like asking about like process, like how people build
the discipline to like, or the habit of always writing and journaling and like, if you have
a thought, just like writing it down and working it out and like working it out so you can
talk about it or speak it clearly or speak it to an audience.
Yeah.
You know, you know, people think I'm crazy because I don't watch the news or anything
like that.
People think you're crazy because of that.
Yes.
I'm sure a lot of people probably think that.
Yeah.
Like, they're like, how do you, how do you not know this?
I don't fucking watch, I don't, I don't watch things I don't like.
Right.
Right.
I don't pay attention to shit I don't like.
That's the fucking, that's another thing, like, yeah, like why I'm not, I don't give
a fuck.
Right.
Right.
Like, like, it's like weird, like, up to date on all the, all the facts.
Yeah.
Okay.
What?
Yeah.
Cause a lot of times when I really think about it, I go, what can I do with this information?
It's out of your control.
Yeah.
That's out of my control.
I don't give a fuck.
Are you with your aunt about it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Exactly.
You know, there's, uh, someone was trying to talk to you about Dr. Dre's divorce.
And I was like, oh, God, so what the fuck's I got to do with me?
I don't even know the guy.
I don't know them.
You ain't getting any money.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It fucking drives me crazy.
Right.
It's like a hot topic.
Yeah.
They're like, how do you not know this?
How do you not?
How dare you?
Yeah.
How dare you not know this?
Because that's what they talk about.
Because it means nothing to me.
It means nothing to me.
That's so funny, man.
So what do people have when they have like conversations, they just want to have conversations
about that shit.
Dude.
Most conversations, like.
The dumbest shit, man.
I'm like, get the fuck out of here.
Fucking boring.
Like, like, I don't fucking, I'm trying to think of some things I don't like.
I mean, everybody, this is everything.
That's everything.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't like Nickelback.
I don't pay attention to him.
Sorry, because of Nickelback.
I'm not a Nickelback fan.
Okay.
You know, sorry to the Nickelback fans out there.
I mean, yeah, I mean, I don't like, so I don't fucking pay attention.
Right.
But you got out there like, hey, did you hear their new album?
Yeah.
The Nickelback did right here.
You know, it's like, like, that's, that's, you know, like that fucks up your brain.
Yeah.
So much when people do that.
Yeah.
You just painted.
Yeah.
You're wasting time.
Why are you paying attention to shit you don't like?
Like, how do you know that?
I don't know.
I'm like, I'm going to stand Michael Rappaport.
I'm going to stand him.
Do you know that guy?
No, I don't know.
Not personally.
I know he lives in LA.
Yeah.
Dude, he is funny.
Oh my God.
I fucking love that guy.
He's crazy.
He's so crazy.
God damn.
I respect him because he fucking, yeah, he does what he does.
He doesn't hold back.
That's him.
Yeah.
But yeah, he was like, oh, I don't like what he says.
I go, you follow him.
Yeah.
Right.
Why do you?
Yeah, I was like, why do you follow him?
Oh, yeah.
Because that's the internet.
Yeah.
God damn.
He's funny as fuck.
Oh, the internet is crazy.
I mean, they follow most people just to hate on people.
Just to hate on shit.
Yeah, that's the most like, yeah.
You know, I got rid of like Twitter, Facebook.
All I have is Instagram.
Me too.
Yeah.
Because I mean, Instagram is a little bit more controllable.
Yeah.
But like, I was like this, like Twitter, I just see shit that I go, I don't even follow
this.
I was like, I don't even know why it pops up.
It just shit this like pops up that I don't even like follow.
So I'm like, how the fuck did that happen?
So I was like, I got to get off of that.
It's just too much of that.
It's just, you know, not good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It doesn't let you like, you know, I mean, you can get like, I don't think it's bad,
but it can be.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
It's like, it's like alcohol.
Like for me.
Yeah.
It's bad for me.
Yeah.
You know.
Do you see that social dilemma documentary?
No, I heard about it.
Holy shit, dude.
It's really good.
It's freaky.
Yeah.
It came across.
Yeah.
Everyone's literally the same reaction.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's everything you're talking.
I mean, it's what you're talking about.
It's just like how the tech industries have just like lost control of trying to make more
money, more ad revenue by just keeping people engaged and feeding him the shit that they
like.
Think about anything that fucking happens.
Um, COVID, you know, these fucking things capitalize off of that.
Mm hmm.
You know, um, you know, shit with racial injustice, capitalize off of that, all these, all these
things that like these big things that, you know, the way they, and they, the way they
push this information, the fucking politics and everything.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
I like, you're 33, right?
Yeah.
How old are you?
32.
32.
So I remember growing up, you know, I didn't, I never knew anyone to fucking argue
or care if they were Democrat or Republican.
Right.
Yeah.
That was never like a thing.
I don't remember that ever being a thing until more so recently.
Right.
And it's the weirdest shit to me.
And it's like, you know, first of all, I think anyone's crazy that just fucking devotes
himself to one fucking side of the, it's the weirdest shit to me because like you, like,
you're not giving anything else a chance exactly.
You know what I mean?
And, and that's the thing that's like, that's why I love like Mark Twain has this quote
about like travel, you know, like going every, like even about staying in a small pocket
and how, you know, that doesn't fucking help you do it.
Like if you just stay on this side, you stay right here, like your brain, you're not, you're
disrespecting your fucking brain.
Right.
You know what I mean?
Exactly.
That's what the documentary explains.
Oh, really?
Because that's how they earn more money.
And that's how they get a better return on their, on the ad money that advertisers spend
because they want people that have specific interests, obviously, and you can, you can
narrow that down when you buy ads on Facebook and Twitter.
So they want to feed these people this exact same content so they can funnel more relevant
ads to them.
And it keeps them in these fucking, in these single lanes of content, keeps them in like
these echo chambers, right?
So basically the, the summary, I don't want to ruin it for you, but the, I, I, I want
to know those people that, you could tell me a fucking movie that I really want to watch.
Yeah.
You could tell me the end and how it happens and I'll be okay.
I don't get two shits ever, spoil me.
Yeah.
So like the moral, the moral of the story is just, you know, the effect of these social
media companies focusing so much on their revenue and not being regulated.
So it's all strategic.
It's like.
They didn't plan on doing this.
They were just doing this to make money.
They didn't, they didn't plan on the effect has been, it's kept people in their own little
echo chambers and it's caused the divide that's going on right now.
Yeah.
Basically everyone only seeing specific shit, like fuck the liberal, you know, these fucking
libtards where they call us libtards or, you know, on the, on the same thing on the,
on the opposite spectrum.
Like if you fucking like guns or, you know, right, exactly.
And, you know, basically these companies have created this with, you know, everything
was, and there needs to be some sort of regulation on it and it's, it's fucking freaky, man.
Yeah.
Oh, just man, just think about, there was something that happened to Justin Bieber.
He was, oh, he was accused of rape and by some people online, they just, you know, posted
it and, you know, he ended up like proving that he did not, you know, he's proven to
shit, ended up suing them or whatever.
But like, you know, when that goes to Twitter, it fucking,
It's out of your control.
It's out of your control.
Oh yeah.
It's like wildfire.
And then, and then, then you go, who the fuck's liable for that?
Right.
Like Twitter, you got to be a held accountable for this shit.
Like they, they try to ruin this man's life on your platform.
You know,
Right.
He's probably spending time and money trying to disprove the plan.
You know what he has to do and everything.
You don't think about that human, you know, you don't think about like what he has to
do just to fucking just cause somebody said, yeah, just cause that's the, that's the fucked
up thing.
And they don't care.
You know, you guys don't work for Twitter, do you?
Oh, no.
I'm sitting here talking shit about your company.
No, I mean, yeah, it's so easy to fuck somebody up like that.
But yeah, but at the same time, I think of this, there's a lot of things out here in
this world, you know, and I learned this from Henry, so that's not for me.
There's a lot of things out there in this world that more so set you up for failure
than success.
You know, why do you think success is so hard?
Failure so easy.
Mm hmm.
Yeah.
And you have to make a choice.
You know what I mean?
It's, it comes down to being on you.
That's why they can get away with it.
Why do you think these fucking places and all this shit can get away with all this stuff?
Because, you know, at the end of the day, it comes down to the person's choice.
Well, they chose to, they chose to drink all that, you know, they chose to drink and drive
all that.
We didn't tell them to do it that way.
Right.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
So it's like, so like, you know, it's always good to just like fucking, you know, watch
out.
Yeah, take care of yourself.
Mm hmm.
You know, it's a...
Moderation.
Moderation.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, what, um, yeah, what's, what's your fucking limit?
What's your fucking, you know, that's all I was like, okay, I don't fuck with Twitter.
Fuck Facebook.
Yeah.
Peace out family.
Yeah, dude.
It's just like, it's just like fucking being addicted to drugs or alcohol.
Yeah.
That fucking scrolling, dude.
Yeah.
It's like another hit of dopamine.
Oh, one hundred percent.
Goddamn.
Yeah.
Like, think about the fucking...
It's just dangerous.
Oh, it is.
Like, uh, you know, like the, what was that, epidemic, the fucking opioid epidemic?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, that's how I lost my brother.
Really?
You know, that's how I lost my brother.
I've lost quite a few people from that shit.
Fuck.
You know what I mean?
We know a lot of people who have been fucked up by that, too.
It hit, you know.
Yeah.
It hit Florida hard, too.
Oh, hit Florida hard, too?
It got super hard, bro.
Shit.
Yeah.
Damn.
We got some fucking horror stories about people we know.
Oh, really?
Damn.
Yeah.
And yeah, it was like the way, you know, people I knew that were just dropping from the shit.
It was like, fuck.
It was crazy.
You know what I mean?
It was crazy.
You know, it's so like, yeah, like, it, you know, all these things, yeah, they set
you up for failure, but you got to make a fucking choice, you know what I mean?
I'm glad I fucking did.
Yeah.
We were talking about, who was that?
I was talking to a guy here yesterday, and we were talking about like the war on drugs
and talking about like making all, there was a country, I forget which country it is,
but they made all drugs legal.
Oh, yeah.
Where is it?
And then their crime went down.
Like if you're addicted to heroin, you can go to a clinic and they'll shoot you up with
some heroin, and that's a clean needle.
The doctor will give you a little dose of heroin, get your fix or whatever.
And now you're not living on the street robbing and doing whatever you can do to get your
little fix of heroin.
That's right.
Diseases.
Really?
Yeah.
Apparently.
Apparently the hell is that?
That's crazy.
Damn, I need to go.
Give me a ticket.
They never got COVID over there.
Yeah, never.
That's right.
Holy fuck, yeah.
It never hit them, yeah.
It never hit them.
Fuck.
What's that?
That's fucking amazing.
I haven't solved so many problems.
Yeah.
You know, it is a very interesting thing, you know, like, you know, especially with
marijuana.
It's like fucking...
Oh, yeah.
Come on.
Yeah.
Come on.
Come on.
If you can drink and smoke cigarettes, you know, weed should be legal.
Yeah.
Weed should be legal.
If that's legal.
Yeah.
I can't believe these fucking politicians aren't campaigning on that heavier.
Harder, yeah.
More, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
Trump or Biden be like, look, I'm going to legalize weed motherfuckers.
They would win.
Oh, they would fucking win.
That's all you have to do.
I feel like.
They would win.
They would fucking win.
Yeah.
Literally, yeah.
Little shit they have to do.
Fucking.
Yeah.
Here's a stimulus check and some weed.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Who we have on here?
I think you know.
I'm David Lucas.
I love David Lucas.
We have on here.
He was talking about how he likes Trump because Trump bought his Yeezys.
That's so funny.
He would say something like that.
He's a great fucking dude.
He's a funny motherfucker.
He said he works at the comedy store, I guess.
Yeah, he does.
He's one of the door guys there.
Do you spend a lot of time at the comedy store?
Well, I mean, yeah.
When it was like, you know.
When it was like open and not coded wasn't fucking everything up.
Yeah.
But I haven't been there like since they've been doing like a little stuff like on the
patio.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, like their patio area.
They've been doing stuff.
But other than that, yeah, I haven't.
Have you performed there?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I was up there a lot.
I've never even been there.
Oh, you've never been there?
I've never.
I haven't been like, I'm not like big into the comedy scene until like recently been
getting more into it.
Yeah.
So what you ever went to is with him.
Who did we see?
Andrew Dice Clay.
Andrew Dice Clay.
Oh, shit.
Like a year or two ago.
Yeah.
What a person to see.
Oh, yeah.
Right?
That's cool as hell.
That was a way to break me into it.
Yeah.
No, the comedy store is like the fucking Mecca.
Right.
The fucking.
Right.
Of comedy.
That's like the hub, right?
That's like.
Yeah, man.
It's like, you know.
Or you catch big people there at any time, right?
There's just, yeah.
That's cool.
Like, you know, cause they were like all those, you know, big dogs, like, you know, they all
would be out on tour.
And when they, they all used to get better like Monday, Tuesday night, the comedy store
was one of the most popping nights.
They just pop in.
Why is that?
Cause like they, they all go on the road like Thursday through Sunday, get back Monday,
have their little rest.
Tuesday nights.
I mean, there was, there was stuff going on every night.
It was still like good, you know, through the rest of the nights.
But let me tell you that Tuesday night, when everybody was getting back in the town, Tuesday,
Wednesday nights.
Extraordinary, man.
Wow.
Fucking like.
So what do they do on those nights?
They, they come to the cops.
It's just, it's just the fucking lineups.
Okay.
You know, you can see fucking, you know, Whitney Eliza Burt fucking.
Fucking Rogan Diaz.
Wow.
You know, all, you like, you see this fucking massive lineup.
Delia, everybody, you see this.
There wasn't.
Alley Wong fucking Neil Brennan.
Annie Letterman fucking just right there.
Right there for you.
That's so cool.
That's so wild, man.
Right there for you.
And it's like, you're seeing them like back to back.
You're like, you can't get that anywhere else.
No, you can not get there anywhere.
Not get there anywhere else.
You know what I mean?
You're seeing the fucking.
Not for anything.
Not for music or anything.
Yeah.
No, you're seeing the fucking biggest people.
Yeah.
Biggest people in the comedy game.
You know what I mean?
That's so fucking crazy.
Miss Pat fucking punky Johnson.
Just fucking.
I bet you got some good ass stories from the comedy store.
Dude.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Man, that's a, that's how I met Rogan.
You know, that's how it became cool with him.
Yeah.
You know, just based off of genuine conversation, you know,
really?
Yeah, they had this program at the comedy store called the
development spot program.
Okay.
And that's how you work your way up to like being a paid regular.
And so you like come in and you do these, you know, you like
calling once a week and give your availability.
And you know, they'll give you, you know, a spot that week or
whatever.
It's like a five minute spot, the very top of the show.
And I was on one that where Rogan was on the lineup and I was
sitting back there and usually like, you know, I'm pretty quiet in
those like areas, you know, when it's like all those big dogs
around, you know, because they know each other.
They're doing their thing.
You guys all in like a room beforehand.
It's like backstage.
Okay.
Yeah.
So everyone's like, yeah, everyone's just like waiting to go up
to see like your fucking idol right over there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, you know, I was just more quiet, you know, because it's
like, they all know each other.
I'm, you know, just, you know, a young, young cat in the game.
Yeah.
And he just, he goes, Hey, what's up, man?
Just, and we just started talking from there, man.
We just got deep, you know, we started talking about books,
started talking about, you know, I told him I was a cheerleader.
He was geeking out over that cheerleader.
And he was, I was like, yeah, you know, I showed him, you know,
the videos and he was like, what the fuck?
He was blown away.
That shit's mind blowing.
Yeah.
He was like blowing away, which I was like, you know, I, you know,
I guess I just don't expect people to be blown away by it because
it's just like, yeah, I was a cheerleader.
But yeah.
And then, you know, as I'm leaving, I was like, all right,
you know, pleasure meeting you, you know, I'll see you around Joe.
And he goes, Oh, wait, wait, wait, what's your, what's your
Instagram, man?
I'll follow you.
And then I was like, oh shit.
Yeah.
And then, and I think your Instagram fucking started getting
flooded after that.
Yeah.
And then he, then he, he goes, he hit me up like a couple of
days later, he goes, Hey man, you know, I'm doing a show at the
store at 10 p.m.
You know, was wondering if you want to be on it.
Do I?
Oh, actually.
Fucking kid.
Yeah.
And then, and then, you know, he asked me to be on it.
I was like, fuck yeah.
You know, and ever since then, you know, he just be real fucking
cool with me, man.
That's cool.
You know, help me out wherever he, he fucking could, you know,
he's a, he's a great, great dude.
You know what I mean?
And, you know, and it's so weird, like the people that don't
understand him, you know, I just think that's, that's the funny
thing about, you know, people, you know, he gets, he gets some
hate from people that don't understand, you know, or really
know about the comedy world.
Not, not, not someone's in the comedy world.
Just by, you know, people, I think there was something with
like Spotify or like, if you don't censor Joe Rogan.
Oh yeah.
We'll walk out, you know.
So stupid.
And is that real?
I guess so.
I don't know how real.
That's what I was like.
How real is that?
I didn't know if that, that actually, I was like, are they
just saying that?
Right.
I don't know.
I know they didn't put any of his Alex Jones shit on Spotify.
Yeah.
I'm not going to bug him about it.
And be like, Hey, man, will you let people, you know, yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.
You know, he's probably already getting a lot.
But, um, um, you know, it's, it's, it's wild when you, when
you see people do those kind of things.
And that's when you, it's like, Oh, you think you know this
person?
Have you ever had a conversation with this person?
How do you know this person?
Right.
Just based off of what you like.
If you listen to podcasts, you know, you probably most of
these people don't even fucking listen to the full podcast.
You know what I mean?
Cliffs.
They're just getting the clips, which is like you fucking asshole.
Yeah.
It's like those, like when someone drops an article, you
don't have any people read a full article, not many fucking
people.
Right.
So that, that's the thing.
And, um, it's like, you don't even know this person.
This person doesn't even know you.
You've never had a conversation with this person.
Why do you think you know this person?
Why do you think you know this person?
Why do you think you know what the fuck, you know, why?
Why?
Why?
Like what?
So why are you saying these things?
You know what I mean?
I don't know anything about Kim Kardashian.
Yeah.
I'm not going to sit there and be like, yo, what the fuck is
she doing?
Why is she such a bitch?
I don't know.
I don't know who she is.
I don't know.
She doesn't know me.
Right.
What does she owe to me?
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
Like that can be wild in this fucking world.
We were talking about earlier with the podcasts, like the
difference between like produced reality shows on TV versus
these podcasts.
Like you're saying like there's like a whole mecca of
people in LA.
There's like a huge podcast scene.
Like I feel like it's very condensed.
Like there's like the Theo Vaughn.
There's Joey D.
I think Joey D has moved, didn't he?
He moved.
But he's doing his own.
He's still doing like podcasts.
And then you do a bunch of stuff with Brandon.
Brandon's shop.
Brandon's shop.
Yeah.
And Brian Cowan, all those guys, they all have podcasts and
they're all comedy guys.
Yeah.
I think that's like a, it's like a, like a weird little
revolution kind of going on.
Yeah.
Well, cause I mean like, you know, the thing is, is when
you become a comedian, it used to be this model.
You became a comedian.
You got a TV show.
It was like, you get a, you get a Seinfeld.
You get a Martin.
Right.
You get a Steve Harvey show.
You get, you know, you get these shows.
Bernie Mac show.
Yeah.
Bernie Mac show.
That was the thing.
That was the thing that took you to the fucking highest level.
That was the thing, you know, that's getting you to sell out
theaters, arenas, you know, but that's not the case anymore.
You know, you, you, you know, with the podcast, you're
shooting the shit.
You know, there's so many options of different types of
podcasts that you, that people can listen to.
People find the ones that they like, you know what I mean?
And, and, you know, podcast fans are really, you know, die
hard fans.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
Because yes, you know, we are talking more real than we are.
We're not, we're not characters right now.
We're not being a character right now.
We're not being produced or told what to do.
Yeah, exactly.
There's no script.
There's nothing to it.
We're sitting here.
We're chatting.
So, you know, with the, you know, people are die, die hard
fans of Ross, the guy from friends.
Yeah.
They're not die hard fans of, I don't know, we don't even
know his fucking real name, you know, but they look at him
and they go Ross.
Yeah, right.
They want to say Ross.
They want to call you Ross.
Yeah.
You know, it's so funny because I've never even fucking
seen friends, but, but I just know, I just hear people
talking about all the fucking time.
But like, it's like that where it's like, you know, this is
just a genuine conversation, you know, but like, but it will
also like, you know, the downside of that is that people
really think they know you and want to talk to you as if
like you're their friend too.
Like sometimes I'll get messages from people where I'm like,
I don't know who you are.
And they go, they want to talk to me, you know, in the way that
we all talk.
Like, it's like cold calling somebody on the phone.
Like, I don't know who you just call him.
Hey, man, I totally, you know, like, I don't know, I don't
know your energy.
Like, how do you want me to, I can't gauge this.
Like, just come in.
Yeah.
There's no foundation for this conversation.
Yeah.
There's no foundation for the conversation.
I was like, how about a hey first?
You know, that'll be a fucking.
Hi.
My name is.
Yeah.
I thought you should do this.
Yeah, exactly.
It's just that just, you know, you know, I wish you guys
probably get it too, where you just, you know, people just
reach out to you and they mean, you know, well, they don't
mean harm, you know, they want to just, you know, they, they,
they're fans of you and they want to say things.
Right.
You know what I mean?
They want to talk the way, you know, put it in and go, that's
not the case.
I don't know you.
I know the people that I'm like talking to.
Yeah.
You know, I actually have an understanding because it's like
face to face, you know.
What is it about, uh, like the comedy scene in LA and like
podcasts?
Like what's the connection?
Why do so many comedians have podcasts?
Because I mean, like I said, like the, you know, the thing,
like I said, um, the thing was to get a TV show, but.
You don't need that anymore.
You don't need that anymore.
I feel like it's backwards though.
I feel like it's the opposite.
Like you said it was comedian, then you get a TV show.
Right.
I feel like now it's like they start a podcast and it makes
them a bigger, more successful comedian.
100%.
Cause you're already doing comedy.
You got a solid flow.
Yeah.
You know, you get a couple of people and it's, it's so, you're
so in control over this.
You guys control this.
You guys are so in control over this.
Right.
You didn't have a manager reach out to me or an agent reach out
to me to, to get me here.
Right.
You just reached out to me.
Yeah.
Exactly.
That's all you did.
You know, so it, it, it's, uh.
And it's easier like we were talking about earlier.
It's much easier.
So it's easier.
It's directly to the customer.
There's no, there's no fucking commercials in the middle.
No.
There's no B-roll.
There's no music.
Yeah.
It doesn't take months to produce.
No.
It's just one day done.
One day and done.
Yeah.
Like this is fucking nothing out of my day.
That's why I love it so much.
Yeah.
It's literally nothing out of my day.
Yeah.
You know, uh, so like that, that has given comedians better
result.
It has given comedians better result and better, you know, like some of the big comedians,
you know, right now have taken off from podcasts.
Mm-hmm.
You know what I mean?
Theo Vaughn, you know, podcasts is what really took them, took them off to another fucking
level.
Yeah.
To where it's like Theo Vaughn, you graduated from club comedy clubs.
Now you're at theaters.
That's why Joe's podcast did for him.
Exactly.
And the thing was like the thing with Joe's situation, you know, that whole men's sea
thing had happened.
Yeah.
You know, and we obviously all know what would happen.
How long ago was that?
It might have been like almost 10 years ago.
Really?
Something like that.
And that was at the comedy store?
Yeah.
It was at the comedy store.
But like, you know, he's said like his agents had dropped him, you know, and he started doing
the podcast.
It was in his control.
Right.
Mm-hmm.
And what does he have now?
Look at it now, man.
Right.
The number one, whatever in the world, the number one, anything.
Like, I'm a fucking massive geek for punk rock.
Yeah.
And the thing about punk rock, there's this thing, you know, we hold on too strongly.
It's DIY.
Do it yourself.
And that's what he did.
Yeah.
And that's what you got to do.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
Do it yourself.
That fucking model, you know.
His podcasts still aren't in fucking focus.
The cameras still are blurry, bro.
Oh, is it really?
I just watched one of his episodes like from like two days ago.
Oh, really?
I mean, it's just like boggles my mind.
Like, you don't even need to have good production.
No.
Anybody could do it.
Anybody could fucking do this.
Anybody could fucking set this up.
You could, you could literally find the cheapest mic.
Yeah.
Cheap, you know, find a cheap camera.
Yeah.
And fucking do it.
Do it in your bedroom.
Absolutely.
Do it in your bedroom.
And fucking, yeah.
Yeah.
And you might make it.
You might make it.
You know, but if you stay consistent with it and always stay, you know, like stay interesting
and the way you stay interesting is continue to learn.
You know what I mean?
That's why, why do you think Rogan interviews so many different fucking people?
Yeah.
He's just trying to like learn and, you know.
Any kind of spark and curiosity.
Yeah.
Exactly.
I think that person, I want to talk to this fucking person.
Yeah.
That's all it is.
And, and, you know, to censor someone wanting just to talk to people is the weirdest shit.
Yeah.
I mean, yeah.
Yeah.
And at the same time, who that's what's so cool about another thing that's so cool about
the podcast is that you could have every single day.
You could have somebody else that you're interested in their narrow little expertise they have
in this world.
Or you can learn all about it on in one day instead of like the fucking if you're producing
a TV show or you're working on a TV show, you work on that TV show for fucking years
or months or whatever.
And you're only focused on one, one subject or whatever.
Yeah.
For a long time.
You like over your lifetime, you're not going to learn that much.
Yeah.
You're going to get stuck in this little grind of like I used to think like the movie industry
working in the movie industry and working on movie sets and shit is like the construction.
It's the same thing as the construction industry.
Oh, really?
Oh, just like that heavy duty?
It's the same thing because there's all just the different trades.
Oh, shit.
You got the fucking electricians.
You got the fucking camera department.
Yeah.
You got the sound department.
And they all have pull up in their semi trucks and they're all on their walkie talkies moving
around.
There's so much.
And then you bring in the different little things.
It's such a big operation.
And it takes so much time.
Yeah.
Damn.
You can't like for one move.
It's the same.
Like when I was younger, I worked in construction.
And then when I started to work on those big movies, I noticed it was the same fucking
thing.
Yeah.
They're all carnies with dental plans, dude.
That's fucking hilarious.
But this is just like so freeing to be able to do this.
Yeah.
You can make your own movie documentary in one day.
You don't have to edit it.
You don't have to do anything.
Yeah.
It's just like, it's fucking amazing.
We literally just fucking, we're just shooting the shit.
Yeah, man.
Why not?
It's super fucking cool.
Yeah.
You mean, yeah.
So like, you know, and thing about comedians, yeah, we love to talk, you know.
Right.
A podcast like perfect.
Yeah.
Put the content out there.
Yeah.
And just putting that out there.
And I'm telling you, man, yeah, it's just a, it's just a better model.
Like, I don't know too many comedians, I haven't talked to too many comedians that
want a TV show.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right?
Like a lot of the people like I talk to and roll with like, I mean, some of them like,
they'll do, they'll do a part in a TV show.
They'll do like, you know, a role, you know, which is fine.
It's just fun.
Fucking.
Make that money.
Why not?
Why not?
Yeah.
It's okay to do that.
You know, I don't think it's like wrong to like want to have a TV show.
I just know a lot of comedians don't care to do it because, you know, they would rather
build their, build a podcast with a hundred, a hundred listeners, right?
You know, on the regular and fucking ride that out.
Yep.
Fucking be on some network where a lot of people are watching, but like, I don't know, there's
just something, there's, podcasts build stronger fans is, I mean, you know, depending on like
your TV show, maybe I don't know what, you know, but there's, there's a lot of comedians
that are on TV shows and aren't strong ticket sellers.
It's soul sucking dude to be a part of that bureaucracy of working on a TV show.
You're like, come on this fucking big TV show.
Yeah.
Chappelle went fucking Africa.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
You know, and that was, that was the power, that was like the power, what he did, you
know, like a lot of people are like, oh, you know, crazy.
No one knows what the fuck that man was going through.
So the fact that people, you know, sat there and said the things that they said, and it's
like, you don't know, you don't know what he's going through.
Let him explain that.
Why can't he explain that?
Why do you, why do you have the answer?
Right.
Exactly.
Why can't he explain that?
Right.
You know, he walked away from that much money.
You don't know what the fuck he was going through.
You don't know what the fuck.
You don't know.
Yeah.
You don't know.
It's the same thing.
And look at him.
He's doing everything he fucking wants to do right now.
Oh yeah, dude.
By walking away from that shit, he is doing everything he wants to do right now.
Yeah.
He didn't, he never chased money.
That's why he's going.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You chase the money, you're going to end up miserable.
Oh dude, if you chase that fucking money, you're going to end up fucking crazy, man.
Right?
I don't even have a car.
I live in a fucking room.
I'm smart, dude.
I share a restroom with two other fucking people.
You know, it's, yeah, why, like, you don't chase it, it'll fucking, that'll happen.
It'll come.
Mm-hmm.
You know what I mean?
It's hard though.
It's hard to balance.
It's hard to, you know.
I'll turn down gigs.
Trading dreams for security.
That's the term.
There's certain shit that I'll turn down, like that, you know, my reps will send me
sometimes.
I'll turn it down because I'm like, yeah, the money's there, but I don't want to do
that.
Right.
Yeah.
Right.
I don't want to do that.
Right.
Just because then, like, I'm not going to give my best self to this project just because
there's money in it.
Mm-hmm.
That's not how I fucking operate.
Right.
Yeah.
I don't want to fucking do that.
Just because there's big money in this part.
Okay.
Yeah.
No, I saw a lot of people that do it like that.
I'll tell you something crazy.
So when my brother passed, he made me the beneficiary for his life insurance and I got $75,000 for
it.
Geez.
And I hated having that money because I didn't earn that money.
And that money, I was like, you know, I mean, I just started helping people with it.
Yeah.
You know, I didn't want it.
I didn't want it.
I didn't like it because, you know, like, I thought, you know, I thought this.
I'll get $75,000 again, but I won't get my brother back.
Yeah.
You know, that's why I like, I'm not a money chaser.
Mm-hmm.
It'll happen.
Yeah.
It'll come.
You know, and I rather it come in, you know, a way of that I felt really good about.
Yeah.
That's where I, that's, you know, how it wanted to come.
Not based on some shit like, oh, if you do this, some good junk of change.
Right.
Yeah.
You know, unless I got too many fucking anger problems, you know, like, I don't want to
just like go in there and be like, you know, do something you don't want to do.
Exactly.
Right.
Because I'll just be upset.
Yeah.
You're just going to sit there probably start steaming.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Like the money is not worth it like that to me to not, to do something that you don't
feel comfortable doing.
Right.
I don't want to fucking do that.
I feel like that happens to a lot of like big actors on TV shows and in movies and shit.
I feel like they end up just getting it, you know, once they get to a certain level, they
just get start doing more and more shit they don't like.
Yeah.
And then some of them have a fucking epiphany like Jim Carrey or Dave Chappelle.
Yeah.
And I think Dave Chappelle didn't end up like doing stand-up like routines on soap boxes
in the middle of parks.
Mm-hmm.
Like in the middle of just like public areas, like unannounced.
It was in his control.
Right.
Yeah.
Nobody was telling him to do it.
Nope.
That's the fucking thing.
That's the beautiful thing, dude.
You know, to have your own control of what the fuck you're doing.
Mm-hmm.
Why not?
And to be able to see yourself in your work too.
Yeah.
It's a fucking, it's a power move.
Mm-hmm.
It's authentic.
It's authentic.
I did that.
Yeah.
I created that.
I respect that fully.
I look at that model a lot.
You know, like, also I look at, you know, guys like, um, um, like Donald Glover, Childish
Gambino.
Oh, yeah.
Guy does what the fuck he wants.
Right.
Yeah.
Does what the fuck he wants.
He didn't even fucking go on social media and still hasn't, and people love him.
Yeah.
I respect that.
I can't wait for the day I can delete that shit.
That's a crazy thing.
That's a crazy thing too, huh?
Some of, like, the biggest people, the people with, like, the, I don't know what the word
for it is, but the, like, people like Jay-Z who don't have an Instagram or a Twitter or
anything there.
You think of them as, like, the fucking, like, creme de la creme of their thing.
Or like, I always like to talk about how Gucci Man went to prison for, like, a few years.
Yeah.
And no one heard from him.
Everyone was, like, freaking out about Gucci Man.
Like, everyone was listening to all of his mixtapes, like, just waiting for the day he
got out.
Like, he almost, like, he ascended to, like, some great level when he was gone.
Yeah.
Yeah.
100%.
Versus when you're on Instagram and you're getting beaten over the head with their content
or their fucking Instagram stories every day, there's definitely, like, a weird thing
that happens, like, in your psychology when you're not exposed to the same shit from that
person all the time.
100%.
Yeah.
I think that's the, that's the fucking thing.
Like, yeah, like, Dave pops up whenever he wants.
Yeah.
Like when he would drop in at the comedy store, it was always like, Dave Chappelle's here.
Oh, shit.
You know what I mean?
Every time.
Every time.
Is it unannounced?
You don't know when it's gonna happen.
Oh, it's unannounced.
Really?
Yeah.
That's so cool.
Unannounced.
And he just fucking rolls up in there.
Yeah, that's, yeah, that's, you know, I hope to get there.
Yeah.
You know, I mean, yeah, everybody would, you know, would want something like that.
But yeah, I, you know, I, I want like all the respect to myself, you know, I just want
to be honest with myself.
So yeah, if I don't want to do something, yeah, you don't have to, you know what I
mean?
Absolutely, man.
Yeah.
So what's your, so what's your schedule like as far as your, the shows that you're doing
in Tampa this week?
How many more shows do you have?
Four.
You got four more shows?
Yeah.
You're doing seven.
Yeah.
That's wild.
Three in one night.
Yeah.
And then one Sunday.
Because I already, I did Thursday, yeah, I got here Thursday, or yeah, I did Thursday
two last night.
So the three tonight and then one on Sunday.
What time is your show tonight?
I want to come out and check it out.
There's 6pm, 8pm in a 1030.
6pm.
Let me know.
Yeah.
I'll throw you guys on.
Hell yeah.
I would love to come check that out.
I went there for the first time.
Where's the size splitters?
Size splitters, yeah.
Have you ever been there?
I've been over, like in that area, but I've never been in Tampa.
It's far out in Tampa.
We went out and we saw David Lucas out there a couple weeks ago at his school.
Okay, yeah.
Yeah.
It was my first time out there.
Yeah.
Let me know, y'all.
I'll fuck him.
Get you guys in and come watch me fucking tell these people what's up.
Hell yeah, man.
That was good.
Well, thanks for doing this, bro.
Yeah, I know what's happening.
I really appreciate you traveling down here.
Yeah, I don't mind at all.
This was fun.
Nothing out of my day.
Nothing out of my day.
How could people follow shit you're doing online?
Fucking Instagram.
Instagram.
Just Instagram.
No Twitter, no nothing else.
No, no, no.
Shit.
Yeah.
Chappelle Lacey.
At Chappelle Lacey.
That's it.
S-H-A-P-E-L.
Yeah.
That's it, man.
Cool, man.
Sweet.
That was good.
Thanks again.
Yeah.
