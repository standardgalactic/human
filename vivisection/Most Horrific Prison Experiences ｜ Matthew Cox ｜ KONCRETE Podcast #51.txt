Hello world, welcome to another episode of the Concrete podcast.
This week's episode is round five with the crowd favorite Matthew Cox.
Matt Cox is a mortgage broker turned mortgage fraudster who was featured on American greed
date line and was eventually sentenced to 26 years in federal prison.
During his prison bid, he began writing the true crime stories of his fellow inmates,
one of which was turned into the movie war dogs.
The first podcast that we did with Matt was the story of his personal journey through
the real estate business, evading the secret service and eventually going to prison.
It turns out he left out a lot of interesting details out of that first podcast, including
how he conned his way out of paying any restitution during his entire prison bid,
dealing with being in solitary confinement for weeks on end,
and even experiencing the 2016 Trump election inside prison.
So anyways, this conversation is packed with gems and I hope you enjoy it.
If you want to support Matt, you should go to his Patreon, which is patreon.com.
P-A-T-R-E-O-N dot com slash inside true crime and subscribe to his YouTube channel,
which is inside true crime on YouTube. Both are linked below.
So, I mean, you don't, this was here when the last time I was here.
What was there?
Was it really?
That garbage was over there on the, I mean, this is really honestly.
You're the last podcast we've done, honestly.
I haven't done a podcast since the last one.
Yeah, I've been on a break.
I've been dealing with a lot of bullshit, Matt.
Can't talk about it.
You want to talk about this?
Yeah, what the hell is that?
The painting you do?
Is it?
Thanks for coming back.
It's great to see you again.
Yeah, yeah.
We have nothing to talk about.
What the hell is this?
Okay, well, what have you brought here?
Is that a cutting board?
It's a cutting board.
Is it fan art?
Yes, it's fan art.
Thank you.
You didn't watch the thing?
Fan art?
Bro, this guy, I get an email from this guy who says, I forget his name too.
I mean, it's like a difficult name.
It's a weird name, yeah.
He's like Russian or something.
Yeah, he's got a YouTube channel.
Shout out to him, whoever he is.
He calls himself the troll.
He trolls people.
He makes fun of people.
Honestly, I mean.
You don't have his name to plug him on here?
No, we don't need to plug him.
We'll shout out to you.
Hit the comments.
Nice guy.
I mean, even though the troll, he's like a nice troll though.
Oh, is he nice?
Yeah, he sent me an email and he was like, hey, look, he says he asked me for a photo.
I don't remember that, but I'm sure he did.
In person?
No, no.
He said the email was like...
He emailed him, yeah.
He was like, hey, I watch your podcast.
You on the podcast, you were great.
I'm in Orlando.
He says I love to get a photograph with you.
I'd like for you, can I get your autograph?
Can you autograph one of your books for me?
But he named a bunch of things.
And I was like, yeah, I mean, if you want to buy a book and send it to me.
I'll buy one.
And I'll sign it and mail it back.
No problem.
So he mails it to me.
I actually went up to Philadelphia.
I was...
I'm writing a biography for this lawyer.
So I go up to Philadelphia for like 10, 11 days.
I come back.
I check my PO box.
He mailed me the...
He mailed me the book, the Shrieker book.
So I sign it.
I mail it back.
Bailout book, right?
Yeah, the bailout.
So I sign it.
I mail it back.
Oh, but when I get it, this is in it.
When he sent me the book.
That's in his video, right?
He makes that in the video.
He makes this in the video.
It's really...
And it's really cool.
It's like a cutting board.
Yeah.
It is a cutting board.
But he...
With the screenshot of the podcast.
That's pretty cool.
It shows how he prints it.
He prints it on the thing.
Yeah.
That's pretty cool.
He puts a gel or a clear coat over it.
He writes that with one of those paint, ink paint sticks.
Yeah.
It's super cool.
Yeah.
And it says, you know...
And because everybody mocked me for the whole...
Let's say I have a what?
I have a degree in Fine Arts.
Fine Arts.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So he does the whole hashtag.
He says it over and over and over again.
So I thought it was funny.
It looks like 3D to me.
It doesn't look like 3D.
It looks like it's popping out.
Yeah.
Something's up with the...
Super cool people make that type of shit.
Yeah.
It was really cool.
Anyway.
And he did this whole thing.
And then so...
Whatever.
Two, three days after I mailed it back to him.
Two, three...
I sent him, hey, here, I mailed it back to you.
Two, three days later, I get...
I get an email from him.
It was just a little link.
I went, oh, what?
Click.
I'm like, oh, that was that guy?
Click.
Boom.
It goes straight to his channel.
And it's a podcast on him trolling me.
He says it's trolling, but he was nice about it.
He's making fun of me, but it's fine.
It's just, you know, it's silliness.
You got a channel just trolling you?
Just trolling people in general.
Or just trolling people in general.
Actually, he does arm wrestling or something, right?
I don't know.
I didn't pay enough attention to him.
I just saw one video.
So, really, you know, it was just funny.
It was nice.
It was nice.
Leave a comment so we can look you up.
It wasn't a jerk or anything.
Yeah, he'll leave a comment on this video.
Leave a comment.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So this was the thing.
And I thought it was really cool.
And I actually sent it to like 10 or 15 people.
That's cool.
That's crazy, man.
Is that your first piece of fan art?
Yeah.
So Matt Cox is now kind of a social media sensation now.
Would you say he has a degree in Fine Arts too or no?
He's super creative, man.
I thought this was great.
I thought it was great.
So what's it like now?
Have you run into anybody in the street trying to get autographs?
No, no.
I ran into one guy at Starbucks.
Like, he's staring at me and I'm looking over at him.
All of a sudden, he comes over and sits down next to me.
I look over and I go, and he goes, are you Matt Cox?
And he had the podcast up.
He pulled it up.
And he goes, is that you?
And I was like, oh, yeah, yeah.
He said, that's me.
I said, that's the Danny's podcast.
And he's like, man, I knew I was you.
I watched the podcast.
We started talking.
We talked for a couple of minutes.
Really?
I sent it to you.
I was like, this guy, you're capable.
This is hilarious.
That's sick.
It's funny.
It's funny that you said that people think that you're some sort of god.
Yeah, they're leaving crazy comments.
I've seen so.
This guy's amazing.
He's so genius.
A lot of people think you still got a lot of money.
He's worth millions.
Yeah.
They think you got some gold buried on the beach or something.
I'm living in my ex-girlfriend's spare room who took pity on me.
Oh, not just that.
Your ex-girlfriend's spare room?
Oh, my God, bro.
Let me tell you.
He never told us that.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen.
Look, first of all, she's not really my ex-girlfriend.
It's a stupid relationship.
It's like 19 years old.
She was like 20.
I'm 19.
We start dating.
We date for a couple of years, and it's a 19-year-old relationship with a guy.
She's not going to kick you out over this story, right?
Hell no.
Bro, listen.
There's she.
No.
Okay.
Listen, now that you've heard this.
I mean, listen, you'll realize, oh, we've been friends forever, but we dated.
It was a typical 19-year-old relationship with a guy, me, who works at a gym, who does
nothing but work out, eat right, work out.
Back then, I'm doing steroids, everything.
So, she's got a job.
She's got an apartment.
I move in with her.
It's just a horrible relationship.
I mean, I'm cheating.
I'm doing all kinds.
I mean, I'm just a complete scoundrel.
I mean, I'm 10 times worse.
Imagine me young and good-looking.
Horrible relationship.
And she keeps taking me back, taking me back, and eventually, it's just the whole relationship
ends.
And then, like, a year or so later, we become friends, and we're really good friends ever
since then.
Hmm.
So, the problem is, like, her mom comes the other day to the house.
I may have to clear this with her.
So, her mother, yeah, like, like, like, for Christmas, like, the 25th.
Yeah, yeah.
Is that where you had Christmas at, at her house?
I stayed in the spare room.
Was it your mom left closely here?
Yeah, but I mean, I picked her up.
I brought her.
Oh, you brought your mom over?
No, no, I went to my sister's house.
Yeah, we should have brought your mom on the fucking podcast.
My mom's 90 years old.
She's, she actually is hilarious.
Is she?
She has to be if she's related to you.
She has all kinds of fucked up shit.
I mean, she's, and she's one of these, she's almost like a Jewish mother, but she's a Catholic,
a Catholic mother is just like a Jewish mother.
Yeah.
Can we get her?
No, it's the constant, oh, you don't shave anymore?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, you do have any collared shirts?
No, I do, mom.
You don't wear them?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, she has one ding, ding, ding.
And then it's funny because her caretaker or her, like her nurse that stays with her,
her nurse hears her make these just little, you know, little stabs and she'll look over
at me.
She screams at you?
Like, did you hear that one?
I caught that one.
Just constantly.
So, but anyway, so Stacey's mom comes over the other day, has a little Christmas with
her kids and, you know, and her husband's there and, you know, I mean, she rents out
a couple of rooms.
Like, she's got this huge house on the lake, two lots.
I mean, yeah, she's just got like, she's running a rooming house for like refugees or something.
Oh, that's pretty cool.
Like me and, you know, anybody who's-
How much is a room?
He needs a room.
You're killing me.
Yeah.
So, this is a nice, it's a nice house.
So-
He's not even kidding, he does.
We'll talk.
She's all filled up right now.
Yeah.
So, I don't see the mom.
Yeah.
Like I stay in the room because they're all doing stuff and then when she leaves, I said,
hey, how's your mom?
And she goes, well, you know, she asked where you were and I went, oh, I said, I was actually
going to go out there and be like, mom and, you know, joke with her.
Yeah.
And she goes, yeah, that wouldn't have been good.
I knew her mom's kind of irritated with me.
Yeah, yeah.
But I was like, oh, I said, well, why do you say that?
And she goes, well, I mean, she's still pretty upset and I went, about what?
She goes, do you have any idea how many times I went to her and cried my eyes out because
of you?
Yeah.
I mean, she's really upset with you.
I was like, oh, wow, I didn't realize she was, I knew she made comments like, oh, that
wouldn't be, you know, she makes comments like she doesn't like you, but I didn't realize
it was like she really is furious with me.
Yeah.
And I went, oh, well, hey, I said, if I'd known that, I would have come out and apologized.
I mean, I was a jerk back then.
I can admit that.
Clearly.
It's been a long time.
You made my daughter cry.
You know, I couldn't go and say, look, I was a dick and I totally fucked up, but I'm,
I'm all better now.
I mean, yeah, it was 19 for God's sake.
My problem is, is that while that whole thing happened, like then, like that later on that
day or the next day, I said, oh, I'm doing a podcast with Danny.
Like he's like hitting the ceiling of like 300,000.
He's like not breaking three.
I was like, I figure we'll do a podcast and say, hey, you know, get your guys to get some
people to fucking subscribe.
Let's get this guy up over 300,000.
You know, kind of do a little podcast like, hey, you know, fuck subscribe, push this motherfucker
over 300,000.
He's got a new fucking, he's got a wife and a new fucking baby.
Yeah, come on.
More fucking subscribers.
Yeah.
Bio hoodie.
And there are guys on there that say stuff like, you know, oh, you're putting all these
ads on.
Motherfucker, I don't work for free.
This is your full-time gig.
And I'm not, this isn't a hobby.
Right.
You know, you have to make money.
That's, but.
Those are just fucking internet trolls though.
You can't take it seriously.
But it's still, it's like a just, I don't know, understand why go out of your way to
be a jerk.
It's just people are upset.
People are fucking pissed off.
That's the new age now.
Yeah.
People are pissed off.
There's people that are sitting in cubicles somewhere in the fucking office building.
Miserable.
Making shitty, shitty wage that are miserable, that fucking, they just want to vent and that's
how they do it.
Right.
I think, I honestly think that's what, that's what it is.
So.
Yeah, but even just people sitting at home all day with nothing else to do.
Yeah, but what?
They love that shit.
This is the second.
They love that.
This is the second coffee, by the way.
So I already drank one.
This is the second.
He walked in here with two vents.
He walked in here with two vented fucking coffins.
It's a Venti Manila.
I'd say with like eight raw sugars.
Matt walks in here with eight.
Eight raw sugars?
Eight?
Bro, I'm.
In each one?
I did like four miles today on the fucking.
Yeah, but raw sugar is not that strong.
Raw sugar is just as bad as fucking sugar.
I don't even drink, I don't even drink all the sugar.
I only drink down to about that when I start to hear, feel the crunch.
The crunch?
You don't like Dunkin Donuts?
I love Dunkin Donuts.
They got the super crunch.
They put all that sugar in the bottom of it.
Yeah, they did.
That Dunkin Donuts fucking iced coffee, holy shit.
Listen, I was supposed to go to Stacey's mom.
I was going to go to her mom's and apologize.
She lives like that.
Tonight?
Beforehand.
So it just so happened that Stacey was like, look, first she comes in and she says, you
know, if you're going to be doing the podcast, you know, my mom's like five minutes away
from there.
And I'm like, I go, okay.
And she goes, I mean, you said you wanted to apologize.
And I went, I said, come on, you're joking, right?
She goes, do you really want to apologize?
And I went, I mean, listen, Stacey, like a saint.
Bro, I'm in the halfway house.
I had two places fall through.
Sure enough, five months, six months later, just before I'm getting out.
Nice.
Two places fall through.
Two places.
Both of them, I would have said for sure.
Both of them fall through.
I call her up and I go, you're not going to believe this.
She goes, I got the room waiting for you.
Wow.
And she's, I knew that.
I knew you were going to end up here.
That's awesome.
She's awesome.
God bless you, Stacey.
Maybe if her mom's so close, we could bring her on here.
Do the apology live.
Yeah, I think we should do the live apology, Matt.
So anyway, I couldn't go because her mother was having like her aunt is going over there
today instead of tomorrow.
So I got lucky and I got out of it.
You got lucky.
I mean.
Quit putting it off, man.
You got to get it over with.
It was two days ago.
You got to apologize now.
Call her right now and speak her.
So anyway, that's what I was going to do.
Thank God it didn't work out.
Next time I come, let's say if we do one next week.
You never apologize.
We should bring her.
You think she'd come on?
She's not going to come.
Why not?
I don't know.
I'm really going to have to almost ambush her.
We're trying to get her to the point where I can just show up because she's mad at me.
Yeah.
I always need to be on here a little bit.
So what was the total?
You were gone for, how many years were you in there for?
12 and a half.
12 and a half total.
Okay.
Yeah.
It happens.
12 and a half years.
12 and a half years.
Changes you.
Between prison and Halfway House and stuff.
Oh.
It was 12 and a half.
Yeah, 12 and a half.
I mean, everybody thinks the Halfway House is, they're always like, oh, so you're free.
You just sleep there.
Right, bro.
That's just another prison.
Yeah.
I was allowed to go to work and back.
When you first emailed me, you were in the Halfway House, right?
In the Halfway House.
Okay.
Yeah.
And it was just because I was thinking maybe we could do like a true crime podcast or something.
How did you find us?
Because my buddy, Trion, who owns a gym, he owns a Coltus 24, 247 Fitness.
He used to be Frank Coltus.
It was his dad's gym.
So he owns these gyms.
It's a boxing gym and a regular gym, 24 hours.
So I call him and I say, hey, listen, I'm in the Halfway House.
And keep in mind, his wife had come to see me a bunch of times.
Like we've always been friends.
Like I grew up with him.
And I said, look, you know, he's like, what are you doing?
Where are you?
I'm in the Halfway House.
He's like, oh my God, what can I do to help you?
And I go, man, I need a full-time job.
And he goes, I can't pay you much, but I'll give you 40 hours a week.
You can work every hour you want here.
And so I was like, fuck, I mean, he was only like three miles away from the Halfway House.
So he came in the first day he comes and picks me up.
He picks me up.
What were you doing?
He's got, I was, what do you mean I was going to work?
I was in the Halfway House.
You were working 40 hours a week doing what, though?
Oh, man, I'm doing, I mean, I'm clean.
This is a different desk at the gym.
I wish I'm cleaning toilets.
Oh, shit.
I'm calling people.
I'm taking out garbage.
I'm fixing machines.
You're the gopher.
I'm doing whatever he does.
I'm doing whatever he tells me to do.
I'm thrilled to be out of the Halfway House.
It's not like you can go have dinner with your sister or something in the Halfway House.
There's no passes.
You know, it's like, oh, they just, like six months before I got there,
they just are letting you have cell phones.
You can't have a laptop computer.
I wouldn't allow it to have a laptop.
So I had to keep my laptop at the gym.
So he picks me up.
And when he picks me up and I get into his Jeep, he got this huge Jeep.
So I get into the Jeep.
He's got a podcast on and it's Danny.
Yeah.
It's Danny.
On the radio.
Just audio.
He's got the audio.
I don't know.
Not on his phone, right?
No, it was just, it was coming through the speakers.
Yeah.
He's got the audio going.
Yeah.
He's running like Apple Music or something.
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, Matt doesn't.
Matt doesn't.
Bro, I don't know anything.
Listen, when I bought my Jeep, when I bought my little Jeep, I got,
he drove it for like a week, right?
Because I couldn't drive it.
I couldn't park it there.
You have to wait till you get a parking spot.
So he took my Jeep.
So he comes to pick me up in it one day and he goes, man, this is really nice little Jeep.
I mean, for what you paid for it?
Is this all right?
And I go, yeah, I said, well, I need a new radio or something.
He goes, what's wrong with the radio?
I go, what doesn't work?
And he goes, and he pushes the button and this thing slides out and it goes.
And it goes.
A little TV or something.
And he touches it and it, and it, boom, it starts playing.
And he goes, I go, fuck, I didn't, I didn't even, and he goes, oh, we got to catch you
up.
That's crazy.
Which one was he listening to?
What did he remember?
The podcast?
It was one with you and Ben.
And he says something about Ben.
He's like, you got to go on there and talk to him because he, this guy does real estate
stuff.
And I went, first of all, I said, this guy, I just got out of prison for real estate
fraud.
That's the last person you want to talk to.
I go, well, not Ben.
He was talking about with Danny.
Yeah.
And I was like, Danny doesn't.
I'm not a real estate guy.
Right.
I said, this guy, this guy doesn't want to, even if, he didn't want to talk to me.
Right.
Right.
I said, I mean, I'm the opposite.
You're the opposite.
Right.
You don't want me.
No.
You don't want me giving people advice.
Right.
I've been in jail for a fucking 26 years.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Tell people, yeah.
Give advice.
What would you do?
Get a new social.
Fucking do the wrong thing, clearly.
Yeah.
But it's still a great story, obviously.
Yeah.
What?
My story?
Yeah.
The story's good.
But I'm saying, he was telling me to go to you to talk to you about real estate.
Yeah.
I was saying, no, but I said, I'll bet you he could help me do some kind of a true crime
podcast.
And then when I called you, you said, the best way to gauge interest is for you to just
come on my show.
And I thought, he's trying to con at me right now.
What?
How did I call you?
I was like, he's trying to just get me to go on and tell that I was like, and then
I was like, I'm in the halfway house, and how would I do that?
And you were like, well, I don't want to get you in trouble, wait till after the halfway
house.
And then I was going to try and do it when I was in the halfway house.
Oh, yeah.
He was going to try to sneak.
We were trying to get him on the podcast one day while he was still in the halfway
house.
And while I was at work, like I could go to work.
You're just going to say you're going to work.
And just leave.
And leave work.
I'm in the halfway houses, though, right?
Well, they get caught all the time, too.
Not when it's published on YouTube.
But that's what everybody does.
Yeah.
And he was like, I could hold it till after.
And then it was, then he was like, but if I'm holding it till after, I might as well
just wait till after.
I might as well just wait till you're done.
So we kept kind of putting it off and back and forth, but he kept answering questions
for me.
You know, like I was like, what about this?
What about, what do you do with this?
How does this work?
How does that work?
And he kept returning my emails.
And then I was like.
You're lucky.
He don't return a lot of emails.
He had a very, very articulate email.
You don't return a lot of those emails.
Usually the emails are like, yo, how much for a podcast?
How much for a documentary?
That's the typical kind of email.
Like, yeah.
And I just reply one million or two million.
Maybe one day somebody will pay us something.
But yeah, no, Matt's email.
I wish I could, I should show it.
I should like display it.
I would like to see that.
Well written.
It was a well written email.
I'm sure it was.
Very captivating email.
Very, very captivating.
And I like to throw in the, I always like to throw in some quotes.
Like the newspaper, the St. Petersburg Times said this, Fortune magazine said this, Bloomberg
said this.
And that way by the time you get to what, when I start talking, you're like, fuck.
Right.
You've already nailed this whole process.
Yeah.
You're lucky.
It's just the same thing.
Yeah.
It's funny.
There's a funny thing about Forbes.
I know Forbes for a fact.
I know a lot of people who pay for articles on Forbes.
You can pay to get anything fucking written, a Forbes article written about you.
Anybody.
Like there's, I know.
I only had one recently written.
Yeah.
I know, I mean, I just know a lot of people who try to like, who try to sell like their
online courses.
I'm not going to name who they are, but a lot of people who like, they sell these online
courses on how to do things like internet marketing or whatever.
They're like, oh, look at me.
I'm legit.
I have an article on Forbes.
The guy just paid, he paid for a, an article to be published on Forbes.
They pay the writer.
They can, you can commission that kind of work.
That's like, that's like a way that they make money now.
Mr. GC.
Nice.
No, different.
Somebody else.
I, um, uh, yeah, the guy, uh, Walter Pavlo, who did the one on me, he actually contacted
me when I was in prison.
Oh, really?
And wanted to write a story on me when I was in prison.
And we went back and forth.
And then when I got out, I called him.
And he wrote that article.
Um, let me think.
Okay.
So.
Yeah.
I'm not saying that you did that.
I'm just saying that's, that's something that a lot of people do.
So it's like.
I'm not.
I don't, I don't have any money.
How much do you think you've got to pay for to get an article in Forbes?
Fuck who knows?
A couple grand maybe.
That's it?
Yeah.
Nice.
Oh, I, I knew a guy.
1500 bucks more than that.
I knew a guy that, a guy Ponzi scheme, he got like a couple million dollars.
And he had gone to like, he had gone to a publicist and gave, gave the publicist like 40 grand.
Publicist got him.
40?
40.
The publicist got him into like a magazine that, I'm not going to mention a magazine,
it's like, it's like a solid magazine that people go to, got an article written about
him being like the youngest, the youngest hedge fund, you know, the youngest African-American
hedge fund.
Bullshit.
Writes this whole thing.
So he takes that and he starts raising money using that article, raises like two million
dollars.
Just straight out of the scheme.
Just complete theft.
Holy fuck.
Two million.
Boom.
I was up in prison with me and he's telling me the story and I was like, well, I don't
understand.
He's like, yeah, they paid the reporter.
It's like, fuck.
Fake it.
Do you make it?
That's nuts.
So what we got here, we got a bunch of funny prison stories.
Yeah.
I mean, okay.
So yeah, yeah, we're trying to.
So that's the kind of like the podcast today.
We got, we got a, we structured it in a way, Matt just put together a bunch of really cap,
you know, a bunch of interesting stories from his experiences and we're just going to piece
them all together and shoot the shit.
Maybe never done this before.
So it may be choppy.
That's fine.
No choppy.
No exhibits this time, Matt.
There's no exhibit.
I still need an outline.
I need like my story.
Everybody needs an outline.
Like my story.
I can sit here.
I got a 15 minute version.
I got a 45 minute version.
An hour and a half.
I got a two hour.
You tell me.
I got a two day version.
Right.
We only got four pieces of papers today instead of a.
My story.
I told it a thousand times, you know, so I know it's still more to your story for sure.
I left stuff out.
Oh yeah.
An outline because like when I got in my car and I was leaving, I was like, oh, I didn't
tell him this one story that was so funny, actually disturbing, but it was, it was a
great story.
Disturbing.
Well, because, you know, people would be like, God, you bastard, like, stop, don't
judge me.
Um, but yeah, there were certain, some stories that I didn't say, but I just forgot in my
own in the first podcast.
So I didn't do that.
The very first one we did.
The very first one.
I didn't want to do that again.
I at least need something because that one now has like one and a half, like 1.2 million
views or something.
Yeah.
Hey, I have a question.
The thing says like, says like 900,000, but then if you click on the video, it'll say
like 1.2 million.
Yeah.
Sometimes just like it's called cash, internet cash.
So like if it's on your phone or whatever, and you may have looked at it previously,
it may now have refreshed that page.
But if you go to the actual video and you refresh it, it'll update it to the actual
view count.
Sometimes when you're on like days, well, really, yeah, this is like, it's been saying
nine.
Yeah.
And yet it's like 1.1, you know, if you look to the thing, it was at 1.2 million.
Yeah.
And it's like, okay, well, this has been like this for a fucking three, four days.
So I didn't know.
I don't know if it's a thing or not.
It's pretty fucking nuts, dude.
Yeah.
We're about to hit 300,000 subscribers.
Two hundred, 299,400.
So 600 more to go.
Yeah, you got to break that 300 that is that.
We were on a tear for a minute.
We were on a fucking roll.
All right.
So everything good, Katie?
Yeah.
Audio's good.
I was just looking at your screensaver.
Oh, in case we want to like pull up any videos or anything, we can just, she can pull it
up on there.
We can look at it now.
No, it's not.
The island's kind of cool looking.
Okay.
Oh, yeah.
Like Fortnite.
Yeah.
It's kind of like the Fortnite Island.
Have you ever played Fortnite?
No.
But we need to get you a PlayStation.
When did you get you a PlayStation?
It was like Nintendo when he fucking went to prison probably.
What was it?
I had something.
Maybe Sega.
I had Xbox.
Jury, yeah?
Yeah.
And Halo 2 had just come out.
Oh, shit.
Right before you went in.
Right before I went in.
Did you ever play it?
You understand that Facebook had just come out?
Like my girlfriend had just gotten up, had switched from MySpace to Facebook.
She's like, yeah, there's this new thing Facebook.
She's like, we ought to get, we're going to get you a thing.
I'm like, I'm on the run from the Secret Service.
No, that wasn't too bad.
You didn't miss too much.
I shouldn't be doing social media.
Yeah.
It seems like a bad idea.
Had the first iPhone been out yet?
No.
Came out a few years later.
I was in prison one time.
And he's sitting there telling me, he's like, yeah, you know, he was doing something with
iPhones where he was getting accounts.
He'd get an account in your name, a corporate account, and then he'd go out and you would
get like eight iPhones in the corporate account.
And then he'd take the phones and then he would sell them overseas.
He had a whole thing.
Yeah.
I knew somebody who did that too.
Two, three million dollars over the course of like two years.
But he's sitting there like, you know, the way it works is, you know, with the iPhone,
he's telling me about it.
And he kept saying, you know how on the iPhone I said, but you understand that your crime
didn't, didn't exist when I first, when I, for years, for years when I came into prison.
Is that a crime note to buy iPhones in the U.S. and go resell them in like another country?
He's buying.
Yeah.
Of course it's fraud.
Is it really?
Well, of course they're fine.
I'm not going to, I'm not going to fucking disclose them at the location of my friend.
They're financing, they're financing the iPhone.
So Apple's financing eight iPhones to a corporation that does, that isn't your corporation.
They're handing them over.
They do something with them and they send them overseas and then they, they give them
like two hundred and fifty dollars for each iPhone and they sell them for five hundred
or whatever.
So this guy's making two hundred, three hundred bucks per iPhone that are like a thousand
of iPhones.
Right.
So, and, and he didn't pay anything other than a signature.
Oh, is he financed?
Yeah, they financed.
See this guy bought, he got, this guy just bought them outright and went and resold them
in another country.
Yeah.
Well, yeah.
Yeah.
Illegal.
What was the biggest difference when you got to like technology wise?
Everybody's walking around like this.
Even I do it now.
They're just walking around.
Just smart phones, right?
Yeah.
They were probably different.
What?
Walking around on their phone, driving around.
Was the Blackberries back then or like?
They had them.
Or like regular phones?
Bro, I had a flip phone.
I had the razor.
Yeah.
The razor.
Hell yeah.
That's right, the razor.
Yeah, we talked about the razor in the podcast.
Yeah.
So I mean, my buddy Trion, somebody sent me something sometime and he goes, and I was
like, Hey, this is when I just, I've been out for like, like the first week I was at
work and he got the, he got up, I got something.
I was like, I need to print this.
How do I print this?
He goes here, send it to me.
Well, how do I send it to you?
He goes, give me your phone.
He sends it to me.
And he goes, okay.
He goes, go ahead and get it.
And I go, get what?
He goes, I printed it.
I go, he's standing right next to me.
And I go, wirelessly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He just printed it at the fucking printer across the room.
I go, are you tweeting on your Twitter account every day or do you have somebody doing
your tweets?
Why?
Is there tweets?
Yeah.
Dude, you're posting tweets like every day, like there's Matt Cox tweets that get posted
every single day.
Like how's everybody's holiday?
Let's pull it up.
Is that you or Troll?
Can you pull up Matt Cox's Twitter?
It's John.
Okay.
There's a guy named John who said, bro, you don't understand how many people do this.
You told me you found a guy that's like running your social media.
Bro, I've had so many people.
But he's doing a great job.
He's killing it.
He is killing it.
He's doing a phenomenal job.
You know, all the videos that got set up?
He put all the videos.
He's like, send me this, send me that, send me that.
He's doing all kinds of shit.
That's great.
I mean, I've had so many people.
Shout out to John, man.
Are you doing a phenomenal job while he's killing it on Twitter?
I don't think you have to sign in.
Just search like Matthew Cox Twitter.
Matthew Beacock.
He did say he was going to send me all the, he was, I'll send everything to you.
Before he puts it out there.
I erase anything that comes to my phone with Twitter.
M-A-T-T-H-E-W.
This guy's running your Twitter.
I thought it was you doing it.
No, I mean.
He had me fooled.
I mean, he knows I'm an idiot.
He knows I've got, I can't, I don't know how really much of anything.
Oh, you know, it's funny though, like all the, all of the artwork though, I did.
Okay.
It's like, he's like, Hey, I need something for like this.
I'm like, okay, I'll put something together.
So what I'm going to talk to him and say, because I think he was doing, I almost, almost
the other day was like, Hey, man, I thought you were going to be doing Twitter.
What's going on with me?
I keep getting stuff from Twitter.
I keep erasing shit.
You're deleting the post and shit.
Posts from stuff that doesn't seem like it has anything to do with me and I was signed
up anyway.
And so I usually, when it shows up, I just erase it, erase it, erase it.
There's certain stuff like if something from Walmart shows up, erase it, erase it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, that's you in the YouTube comments on the videos.
Oh yeah.
That's you in the YouTube.
I figured out.
Yeah.
He's got YouTube dialed.
I got an Android and it got, it immediately got a virus on it.
Mm hmm.
You get a virus on an Android.
Yeah.
Well, yeah.
iPhones don't get that.
Apple doesn't get that shit.
Yeah.
Apple, we don't get that shit.
And it, they were difficult.
You know, come on.
I didn't understand how everything worked.
So I'm having a real hard time with it.
And Trion was like, you know, finally he just said, listen, man, he said, you got to get
an apple.
He was there like idiot proof.
Yeah.
Anybody can use one.
He goes, I can use one.
He goes, I can barely read.
Right.
And he said, so I was like, fuck.
So I went out and I got an iPhone.
I, you know, still very, you know, almost no money and got an iPhone because talked to
a buddy of mine.
He's like, hey, what's going on?
My fucking phone's fucked up.
I go, I got to get into the phone.
He was, well, how much are they?
You know, they got this thing for like 400 bucks.
You can get this.
And he goes, okay, well, I'll have somebody send you 400 bucks, send me 400 bucks.
This is my buddy in prison.
No.
Every time I've, I didn't tell you this.
No.
Oh, that's why I was saying we, I need to do, I needed, we need to do a podcast just
on me setting up my, my website, YouTube, all that, because every single dime of everything
that I've done from my laptop, iPhone, everything, guys in prison have sent me money.
Everyone.
They're like, oh, you got to set up your website.
I'm like, yeah, but it's like a couple hundred bucks for this, a hundred bucks for this,
a hundred bucks for this.
I got to hire this chick to do this, hire this chick.
I'm like, well, how much is that?
I go, it's like 800 bucks.
They're like, well, he's like, okay, okay, well, I'll get you the 800 bucks.
What?
He's, I'll get you.
And I, why?
He's, well, my buddy, my buddy Pete, Racini in prison.
No, Racini.
He's giving you money for this shit.
Not him.
Just people in general in prison.
Do you understand that the guys in prison are like, he says, he walks across the fucking
compound and guys are like, bro, what's going on with Matt?
He's like, yeah, I haven't heard from him.
And he'll go, or he'll say, you know, sorry, he'll say, yeah, you know, I, I've you heard
from him.
Yeah, yeah, I heard from him.
What'd he say?
What's he, how's he doing?
Is he doing the, is he trying to sell the stories yet?
Is he, what's he doing with the stories?
He's like, he needs to set up a website and, and they're like, well, look, man, if he needs
anything, let me know.
Can they get access to YouTube in there?
No.
No prison?
No way.
Hell no.
There's no computer.
There's a computer, but you have no access to the internet.
You have a very basic email system.
Okay.
It's like if you, it's just prison though, because county people can get on like Facebook
and shit on computers in there.
You can have phones in there and stuff in certain prisons or county jails.
Yeah.
Luke's brother had a phone in there with the fucking internet.
Right now he just went to the shoe box.
Yeah.
But somebody fucking booted it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You understand that?
No, you can buy it.
Yeah.
It's, it's contraband.
It's fine.
Contraband.
You just got to, I hope he's not in jail right now.
You just got him jammed out.
No, we'll edit that out.
Maybe your PO might not like if somebody, people in there are sending you money anyway.
Bring it in or one of the CO's bring it in.
Yeah.
They'll, CO's will bring in a phone and get a phone.
There's guys that have phones.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
And then they get popped every once in a while.
They, everybody goes to the shoe and everybody's phone number who's on your phone.
People will put phone numbers on their, on their account where they're calling their
mom.
Yeah.
And then they'll put the mom's phone.
That phone.
Well, as soon as the cops grab the phone, they go, okay, let's start cross-referencing
these.
Because you can see videos.
Oh, Jimmy.
Jimmy talked to his mom four times.
Throw him in the shoe.
Oh, look.
It's Bob Johnson.
Did you ever get thrown in the shoe?
Oh, I've been in the shoe like three, four times.
Really?
Yeah.
For what?
Never did anything wrong.
What is the shoe for the people listening that don't know?
Shoes is the hole.
It's the hole.
What the fuck is a hole like?
It's, it's fucking horrible.
It's really not.
Okay.
Look, it depends on who you are.
For me, it wasn't horrible.
Yeah.
I don't mind reading.
So you get bored enough.
I'll read.
You just need to read.
I just read.
I'm knocking out a book a day.
The worst thing was is banging on the door.
Well, at least the hole came to that bad if you have a fucking access to a library.
You don't have actually, that's what I'm saying.
You bang on the door.
They have a little cart they bring around.
You bang on the door until the cop goes, you go, books, man, give me a book.
Give me a book.
They're like, hold on, cops.
Hold on.
And then they'll come back with the cart maybe an hour later.
They'll be like, what do you want?
I'm like, you know, give me that.
Give me this one, this one.
They're like, hey, I got a James Patterson.
Fuck James Patterson.
He's fucking.
Give me that.
You know, you start yelling and they'll give you four books and you're like, okay, okay.
Four.
Wow.
Four at a time.
That's it.
Damn.
And then you got to give them back.
So they're like, all right, how many?
Give me the books back.
I know you got books.
You know, so you got to give them books back and shit.
You got to swap them.
So what does the hole look like?
What does the shoe look like?
It's the room and everyone's, every prison is different.
But in Coleman, the shoe is probably the, it's a six foot wide by probably 10 or 12
feet deep.
And you've got a stainless steel shower in there, stainless steel toilet, stainless
steel sink.
So it's a sink combo, sink, toilet combo and then a shower.
Shower is hot as hell.
I mean, yeah, I mean burning, scolding hot.
So you actually have to turn it on and let it run.
You have to wait till everybody's like using the shower at some point and then you can
give them a shower.
So it cools off.
It's bad.
How many people are in the shoe at once?
Oh God, man, the shoe is massive.
There's, there'll be a hundred, hundred guys, 150 guys in a six by 12 room.
No, that's their own one person.
I want to say, I'm like, what the fuck?
Every room.
No, you're killing me.
They've got wings.
It's massive.
Don't put 200 guys in the shoe.
So it's just massive.
So you've got wings.
Okay, got it.
These hallways with nothing but sell, sell, sell, sell.
And they're two man cells.
Oh, they're two man.
They're two man cells.
You know, like me, I would be in there for like two, three weeks without a celly.
And then-
That doesn't sound bad.
Yeah, but you never leave.
You're in there what, 23 hours today?
That's the fucking stat of the kicker to it, okay.
You know what time it is based on how many, how many meals they're giving you.
Yeah.
Like by the third meal that day, you're like, oh, it must be, it must be basically around,
it must be about-
And what, you get one hour out of there?
Once a week.
You get one hour.
One hour a week?
Out of seven days?
You get one hour out of there?
Pretty much.
I thought you get one a day.
Oh, no, no, no.
I might say that, but we're talking about, it's just almost never, it almost never
happened.
And you know where you're going?
You're going into a room this size that's a chain link fence.
You can't see anything.
It's straight up sky, and you're in a, it's a big chain link fence, and you got nothing.
So what am I doing?
I'm gonna run in circles inside the, what am I doing?
At least you get to breathe some fresh air or something, you know what I mean?
Huh?
At least you get to do some fresh air or something.
I mean, I guess if you're a fan of fresh air, I mean, I've been a fan of my whole life.
I love AC.
I could, I could never be outside.
I hate outside.
They had AC in there?
Yeah, it's freezing cold.
You burn it yourself, you take a shower, and I'm not complaining because other shoes
are horrible from what I've heard, roaches.
There's no roach problem in Coleman, which is great, because I hate roaches.
So I know guys that-
It's interesting in Florida too.
Oh yeah, yeah.
But they've got, you know, look, the prison, it's clean, you know, it's a pretty new prison.
It's really the garden spot of the BOP.
Most prisons are just disgusting.
They're falling apart.
So that shoe, although the fact is that you are separated from everyone, you can't, you
can't really, you can't really get visits depending on what your secure, what your level
is.
It's not that bad.
You know, I like after three weeks, I remember Thomas and for like two, three weeks, and
usually they'll come, they'll bang on the door, they'll be like, gosh, you want, you
want to sell it?
You know, they'll say, you taking sellies, and you're like, you know, no, no, you know,
You know, it's freezing cold.
They'll let you choose where you want to sell it.
That's what sucks is you don't get a pillow, you get one.
There's no comforter.
Oh God, your bowl, your balling up your clothes to use it as a pillow.
It's miserable.
And you're freezing your ass off.
Oh, of course.
They can't give you a fucking hoodie.
No, they don't give a fuck about you.
They don't care about your comfort.
Um, so you're, they don't bang on the door, you want, you're taking sellies, and you
and you're like, no, no, and then after two weeks,
it's like, yeah, bro, give me somebody.
Get somebody in here.
Anything.
And then they'll put some guy in there for two, three days
and you guys are talking, you'll talk like a,
like fucking 24 hours straight.
You know his whole story, he knows your whole story,
and then three days go by and it's like,
they'll swap cells and yeah, I'm sick of this,
and then the guy's like, all right, man, I'm gonna go, bro.
You can go.
Hopefully, as long as you're okay with each other.
What else?
So yeah, it's not, it's not, look, it's bad.
I hate to say it's not bad.
It wasn't bad for my personality type.
And that prison wasn't necessarily that bad.
Right, and some people, and keep in mind,
I was at the medium, I was at the low,
I actually went to the,
I actually went to the shoe at the pen.
So I used to always say this, I used to say,
when people, I thought, when I get out and people ask me,
where'd you go to prison?
I can say, well, you know, with the Coleman,
I did a little bit of time in the pen,
a little bit of time in the medium,
and I finished out my bid at the low, and that is true.
I was in the shoe at the pen for one day.
As a federal pen.
The federal pen for one day, terrified.
I mean, listen, on my way, on my way,
when they put, bring me into the shoe,
and then I'm shackled, and I'm walking in,
literally, on my way there, I'm like, bro,
I said, you can't put me in with one of these motherfuckers.
And they're like, Cox, don't worry.
We'll put you in a, they were so nice.
The CEOs were so cool.
Why were they so nice to you?
Well, because they're like, he's from the low.
Look at this little fella.
They knew he'd get fucking bent over backwards.
Oh my God, these guys were good.
I don't appreciate that.
But these guys are vicious.
Well, I mean, you would have, right?
Fuck them.
But a lot of times those CEOs don't care.
Is there a lot of rape that goes on in those prisons?
You know, fuck you.
No, there's really, look, the problem is this.
People think that they're violent.
There's plenty of ways to rape someone.
They can just pressure you,
where you think you're gonna get stabbed, right?
Four guys walk in on you with fucking shanks.
What do you know?
Have you heard stories saying that shit happen?
I've heard that happen.
Or guys, and here's the problem is,
there's a ton of, matter of fact, I got a story in here.
This is like the most embarrassing, I'll tell you.
It's the worst.
There are, keep in mind, there are gay guys in prison.
So you tell me, if you're some guy with a life sentence
and you're prone to homosexuality,
maybe on the street you wouldn't have been a homosexual.
But in prison, fuck it, I got a life sentence.
You're gonna, it's not like they're all macho guys.
No, there's a thousand guys, there's 20 gay guys.
And there's three fucking transgenders
that look like women.
That's like Jake told us.
He was like, there's guys in there that are even,
they're just gay in prison.
Yeah, they said, no, they call it gay for the stay.
They leave, yeah, that's what he said.
One of our friends said that some people
just leave it at the gate.
They say that when they leave, they leave it at the gate.
That's what they say.
I was like, the guys will come to prison,
pick up a Bible, and then be in the church
all the time for four or five years,
and then when they leave,
they basically drop the Bible back down.
They're like, what were you thinking?
They need to get him through.
Whatever it takes to get him through it.
Either God or sucking dick, one of the two.
Maybe a little of both.
Maybe, hey, maybe they could kind of go hand in hand, right?
So.
No comment.
So yeah, 24 hours.
So I was there for 24 hours.
But keep in mind, when I'm walking in to the pen,
guys got fucking tattoos on their eyelids,
their whole faces tattooed, their whole body.
So wait, let's go back to that when you're like,
don't put me in with one of these motherfuckers.
Like, don't cocks, don't worry, we got you.
I was like, you can't put me in with one of them.
And he goes, no, no, no, don't worry, don't worry.
You're good.
So they lead me into a regular, into a fucking cell,
and the cop was like, okay, look, he said,
keep in mind that at the low, the COs are dicks.
Complete fucking assholes.
Not all of them, but a lot of them.
Like just, you can't believe what fucking pricks
these guys are.
So the pen, they're like, okay, cocks, listen,
here's what, I got your fucking clothes right here.
I got this.
Here's some cleaning stuff.
Don't drink it.
And I was like, like a fucking drink.
He's like, you know what I'm saying.
Suicide.
Yeah, you just don't drink.
He said, I know you like to read.
I got you about three or four books right here.
If you need any other books, just bang,
don't push the button, just bang on the door.
We'll bring as many books as you want.
I don't know how long you're gonna be here.
If you need anything at all,
let me know.
I was like.
Wow.
Was it just because you were so nice to them or what?
Am I at the fucking Ritz or am I at the Ritz?
Anybody I've ever talked to in prison,
they've never said anything like that.
The CO's being that nice to them.
At the pen, the CO's are extremely nice.
Because if you're some guy who's been locked up 10 years
and you're gonna die in prison,
are you gonna, and you're six foot two
and you've been working out for 10 straight fucking years,
are you gonna take any shit from anybody?
The CO or the prisoner?
The prisoner.
He's not taking any shit from you.
Some fucking guard mouse off to him,
it's like, what the fuck are I'm dying in here?
You're gonna disrespect me.
He has nothing to lose.
I'll beat you to fuck until they pull me off your ass.
And the CO's know that, so they're very respectful.
So what happens is in the medium,
they're a little bit more lippy.
At the low, they know that you're at a low security prison.
It's people that have been,
they're in there for nonviolent crimes.
Well, no, there's violent,
but if you've worked your way down to a low,
you've been behaving.
Right, so they don't wanna do anything crazy,
or else they're gonna get-
They try to push you, right?
Right, and they push you,
and so some guys snap,
and they might be mouth off,
or they get into an argument,
they hit a cop or something,
you go to the fucking, guess what?
Here you go, back to the fucking medium,
or you just take it, yes?
Because they got leverage on the prisoners there.
They got a lot more leverage here earlier.
He's never had a nice story to say about C.O.
That guy that was here earlier, yeah.
He probably went to state prison, right?
Oh yeah, he did like seven or eight years.
Right, hey, figure I know that.
Hey, look at that dude, state prison.
Yeah.
I don't even like hearing stories about him.
Boosh out at the set,
he's a good fucking dude right there.
No, I'm sorry.
They work construction together,
and he's actually got a country music career
in the blossoming right now.
Did you have him on your podcast?
Yeah, he was on one of the podcasts.
He's the guy, the country guy.
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw that.
I saw part of that, yeah.
Yeah, he's awesome.
He's got some really sick music videos on YouTube,
and they got like,
he gets shitloads of views on his music videos.
He's funny, that guy, he's awesome.
But like, guys would come in from state prison
and start telling their state prison stories.
Yeah.
I can't, you have to leave.
Yeah.
They got. Why?
They don't have any funny stories.
Oh yeah.
They're all vicious, they're all horrible.
That's all the stories he's ever told me for sure.
Right, because violent guys end up in state,
you know, very suddenly,
I've known murderers in prison, in federal prison,
but they have federal crimes attached to them.
You know, most people are like,
oh, you're around murderers, not a lot.
You, it's very seldomly do you get murders
in a federal prison.
Murder is a state crime.
You know, rape is a state crime.
You know, you got,
all these different types of crimes
that are violent crimes, they go to state prisons.
So you're in there with guys that are getting into fights
or breaking in places.
But chomos were in there, right?
Well, see, but if you're a sex offender,
if you're a sex offender and you're in the state of Florida
and let's say you have sex with an underage child,
well, you're gonna go to a state prison.
But if you are on the computer
and you're looking at a dirty picture, federal.
Oh, okay.
You understand, so you get the,
you get the chose in there, in the federal prison,
but 99% of them looked at some pictures of kids.
They're just looking at shit online, yeah.
And they'll get three, six, eight, nine, 10, 12 years.
Like Jared Fogle from Subway or something.
Right, but, no, well, that's,
that's sick, fucks.
Yeah, but he's fucking hands on.
I mean, he's all fucked up.
He went to the next level.
Yeah, he's, and the fact that the,
the fact that he only got like 15 years or something.
What exactly did he do?
I mean, at first, I didn't even pay attention to that.
He just did multiple things.
He's done like a ton of fucking child porn on his shit.
Child porn, but he's also got guys
bringing him like underage girls.
I mean, he's doing pictures of them and shit.
Yeah, so he's, it's state and federal.
Or if you're bringing a girl over state lines, federal.
Or boy, whatever it is, whatever they're doing.
So, so you got these guys.
And where is he now?
I don't, is he still in prison somewhere?
I don't know.
That probably wasn't 15 years ago, I don't think.
No, it wasn't 15.
No, that was like maybe six or seven years.
Guys were all saying, everybody was saying,
oh, he's probably going to call me.
He's probably going to call.
Cox, you're gonna write his story.
Why, he was in, Jared?
Write the Jared story.
They were saying that there was a,
they said, oh, Subway's coming out with a new sandwich.
Why, he's a Florida guy?
Oh, no, he's just shipping.
They would ship him there.
Just because it's a high profile, if you're high profile,
a lot of high profile guys end up in Coleman.
Go to Coleman, gotcha.
So everybody, when that happened,
they were saying that Subway was coming out
with a new six inch, the predator.
Oh my God, I think I saw that.
So, what was I going to say?
What are we doing?
We were talking about Chomos and Feds and State Prison.
Oh, you were talking about like the CEOs
that were really nice in the federal pen.
Yeah, because it's dangerous, like when I went to,
I actually talked about that in here,
that was one of the points I was going to get to,
is when I came to the low SIS,
they talked to every amendment that comes in.
It's like the security, secret security wing
of whatever agency within.
They basically patrol the officers and inmates and drug.
They're like the FBI inside.
So they meet with one of them and they sit down with you
and they say, okay, here's where things work.
And remember the guy said, he goes, all right, listen,
Cox, you probably, you just did three, four years.
You know this.
He said, in the pen, we're trying to keep the inmates
from stabbing us and he was in the medium.
We're trying to keep the inmates from stabbing each other.
At the low, we're trying to keep the inmates
following the rules.
He goes, follow the rules, you'll be fine.
And I was like, oh, I'm good.
He was all right, that was it.
Well, I always thought he summed it up very nice.
Even when he said it, I was almost like, really,
that's a nice, you summed that up really nicely
because that's true.
The CEOs are concerned about the inmates harming them
in the pen, so they're respectful, they're polite.
The medium, the guys are really fighting amongst each other.
They could be a little bit more of a dick to everybody.
Not much.
The low, they can just be complete fucking.
They just want to boss you around.
They just want to push you around.
I basically, I was a good inmate.
I basically follow the rules for the most part.
You're always doing something stupid.
You know, I'm selling certificates at the,
I'm doing the real estate class.
I'm selling, you know, you don't want,
you're taking the real estate class
because you need to get a certificate
to make your counselor happy
because you're supposed to have so many certificates.
You know, you don't really want to do anything
with real estate.
Nah, man, I just, okay, great.
Go get me two coffees, two creamers from Commissary.
Bring it, I'll do all your tests.
I'll put it in.
You'll get a fucking perfect grade.
You'll get your, and then come back,
come back in three, or two months, three months.
You get bossed to do that.
And I'll give you, like, I got questioned a bunch of times.
Oh, did you?
I was always in doubt.
Who would say that?
I would never, I think this very seriously.
I'm offended by it.
I want to know who said that.
That's ridiculous.
Okay, Mueller.
I was gonna, I was gonna.
Yeah, because you've already nailed that.
I'm always, I'm always, okay, how can you say that?
Spell or reputation.
So, the same thing you would do at the bank, right?
I'm fucking leaving.
Oh my God.
Call the guy in the check.
Guy in the leave, just give me my shit back.
Oh my God.
Okay.
Come on, let's go through this fucking thing.
I worked on this all day.
I mean, this is killing.
Okay, what was your first day in county jail like?
Okay, I only mentioned, I kind of just go through it real quick.
I mean, I'm not real quick, I'm saying.
Let's go through it.
Okay, we got a nice little synopsis here
we were gonna go through.
So, what, this is after court, you get sentenced,
what, first day you go to county jail first?
Oh, no, no, no, not I get sentenced.
No, it's not like it was out on.
This is when they arrest me,
bring me straight to fucking county jail,
you're in jail, I walk in, guys are all,
I remember guys, everybody was staring,
I walked into a room.
It was actually about the size of this room,
maybe a little bit longer.
This is like what, booking room?
No, this is like, this is where the beds are.
I've already been booked, I walk in,
and I remember all the inmates are staring at me,
there's like 20 guys in this room,
this size, all sleeping in this room, 20, 22 guys.
I walk in, they're all staring at me,
and I'm thinking, holy shit.
And they're all looking at me,
and the guy goes, he points up,
and he goes, you were just on TV.
I go, what?
They were watching the news,
he goes, you was just on TV,
he said, you, you, he said something about,
and she said, you steal a bunch of money
from an insurance company,
and somebody else goes, banks, bro,
that shit banks and shit, you a gangster motherfucker,
you a gangster, I thought, holy shit,
I don't know what he's saying.
I mean, these guys are just,
I don't hang out with this guy.
But they liked you.
Yeah, no, well, they didn't start stabbing me,
which is what my concern was when I walked in,
I looked at these guys, I mean, it was like, holy shit,
this is a bad situation.
So, I go in, first thing I do is I wanna make a call.
I go pick up the phone,
I can't figure out how to use the phone,
I'm punching in numbers, can't figure it out.
This fucking black guy comes over to me and he goes,
yo, he was trying to call Pete,
I said, I'm sorry, trying to call Pete,
I'm sorry, try to Pete, man, try to call Pete, man,
Pete, I start looking away,
looking around like, I don't know what the fuck he's saying,
and he's speaking English.
Right.
So, this white guy comes over who's got tattoos,
he's got horns and shit on his fucking forehead,
and he comes over and he goes, I got this.
He goes, you're trying to call your people,
and I go, my people?
Your peeps.
Keep in mind, I've never even heard the term people.
Keep in mind, I'm not keeping a line,
I say that all the fucking time, I don't give a fuck.
You're just the epitome of white privilege,
you've never been around anybody in any culture.
I've never been around, I've been around Spanish guys
and some black guys, if they're doing the roof,
or they're doing, but I'm not, or they're educated,
I haven't been around guys that are street guys.
That are street guys, yeah.
I've never met a street guy,
so the white guy comes up, he goes, he said,
you're trying to call your people,
I go, my people, he's your family,
or you're trying to call your family,
and I was like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, he goes, okay,
I got this.
So he helps me use the phone.
I can't even use the phone,
you gotta push the fucking 50 numbers
and you get a big call.
You gotta put your inmate number in everything.
This was the beginning of a long journey, Matt.
I remember talking to the white guy,
after, you know, you got nothing to do.
There's one TV, out of 20 guys, 15 of them are Spanish,
so guess which channel you're watching?
The Spanish channel.
Yeah, so you're just sitting there,
all we're doing is playing chess and talking.
So the guy's got horns on his head
and I went, bro, after a couple of days,
you seem like a normal guy.
And he goes, right?
I go, what's with the fucking horns on your head?
He goes, eh, you know, I came in young.
I think I told you this one time.
He came in, he goes, I went to a prison
where guys were being killed every week.
He goes, so, I didn't think I was gonna make it,
so you just get crazy.
He said, then I finished my state sentence
and I came here to the feds,
so I had a fed bid to do.
He said, now I'm gonna be out in a few, huh?
So he, you know, so, you know, he's leaving,
so he's going to the feds now.
And so now he's got four,
he thought he was gonna be dead any day now.
He's got tattooed fucking spiral horns on his forehead.
He's got all this, now you're getting out.
You're not getting a job at the bank.
What were you thinking?
You know, he thought he was gonna die,
so he thought he'll never survive it.
Anyway, so you meet all these guys,
so I end up, then when I eventually get transferred,
I get flown to Oklahoma City.
You get drive driven around in these vans and shit,
it's horrible, being transported is the worst.
You get moved around, you end up going to Oklahoma City,
and is it fucking 840?
Yeah. That is ridiculous.
We didn't start the podcast till 745.
Jesus God Almighty, we've been talking for an hour.
We're waiting on Foco over here.
No, it had nothing to do with me.
Okay.
So, are we getting through this?
I mean, we just started.
Cause I'll talk like, you saw all those,
all the guys like, I'll watch a six hour podcast?
Yeah, yeah.
Are you insane?
There's like 60 or 80 guys saying, I'll watch six hours.
You gotta go home?
You're captivating, man.
Danny might have to go home.
That's the only thing.
Well, Danny's got a wife.
I don't got shit.
I'm off the hook tonight.
Danny could leave.
Me and you could chat for a while.
I got all night, Matt.
Okay, so anyway, I get transferred,
I fly around, I eventually end up back at Coleman.
You know, I get sentenced, I go to Coleman.
When I go to Coleman, they send me to the medium first
because I had so much time.
I had 26 years, so you got 20 years left.
You're just done.
You know, you can't, I couldn't really send me to a pen.
I can't go to a low.
I go to the, I go to the medium.
I go straight, when I go straight into the housing unit
where I'm supposed to go, I meet my celly.
I think I mentioned this, remember what I tell you that?
That I meet my celly and then I walk back out
and then they start screaming lockdown.
Oh yeah, somebody got stabbed up.
Somebody got stabbed in the arm.
Yeah.
So he's like, you gotta get in here.
He's got stabbed up a little bit.
Yeah, he was like, oh, somebody died and he's like,
no, no, somebody just, they got stabbed up a little bit.
First day.
Yeah.
Just stabbed them up a little bit.
That's the same thing Tampa Tony told us
when he went to prison for the first day,
somebody got stabbed out there.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's, you know, it's a bad situation.
So.
Yeah, it can't be a good situation.
I'm getting stabbed up a little bit.
He's got poked a little bit, right?
Yeah, just got.
He survived, right?
I don't know.
Who knows?
Who knows?
I'm sure he's fine.
You know how many guys I've met?
Listen, like 90% of the guys that meet him have bullet holes,
but they've all been shot.
Everybody's been stabbed.
Everybody.
It's just ridiculous.
So I mean, you get the mindset there is so,
it's so, there's so much mental health issues.
There's like, they got a whole wing
just for guys with mental health issues.
Bipolar, they've got guys that,
there was a guy named Mr. Freeze,
who had a narcolepsy.
Yeah.
When you fall asleep, right?
What happened?
Mr. Freeze.
They called him Mr. Freeze because he had narcolepsy.
And narcolepsy apparently,
like he would be walking across the compound.
And just fall asleep?
Yeah, but he wouldn't fall.
He would, if he was sitting down, he'd fall down.
He would walk and he'd suddenly just stop.
And he'd just sit there for like a minute or two
and then he'd go.
Just blank out.
And he'd start walking again.
And they called him Mr. Freeze.
Guys that were in the unit with him,
they said he'd be,
he would be sitting in a chair watching TV
and all of a sudden he'd go,
and he'd fall out of the chair and hit the ground.
Boom!
And lay there for a minute or two.
And guys would just look over.
And he'd get up, get back in his chair.
You telling me hitting the ground didn't wake you up?
Holy shit, dude.
So, you know how he ended up in the feds?
How?
He got some for theft or something,
whatever, something stupid.
He ends up getting, going into state prison in Florida.
Well, there's no, there's no AC.
So he's there in his cell,
and he's like, he's complaining about how hot it is.
And he goes, oh, you want,
you want AC is you got to go to federal prison.
He goes, why do I get to federal prison?
And he goes, oh man, you could do anything.
You could, you just got to commit a federal crime
and you'll do all your state time in federal prison.
Yeah?
He goes, yeah.
He said, well, what's a federal crime?
He goes, you could threaten the president.
So he writes a letter to Bush.
So at the time, he writes a letter to Bush
and he says he's going to kill Bush and his entire family
and he's going to rape the dog.
Wow.
Just a little sprinkle on top.
Yeah, yeah.
Go ahead.
And so.
For good measure.
Secret service come, they question him.
He says, yeah, I wrote the thing.
They bring him back to court, gets him from the court.
The judge, the lawyer explains to the judge, listen,
the guy is, he's practically retarded.
I mean, you know, I mean, he had like issues.
And he's like, your honor,
this is what his cell he had told him.
It's not, and the judge goes, yeah,
but he wrote the letter.
You know, these judges, they had no sympathy.
They don't care, right?
He's like, yeah, but he wrote the letter.
He's like, he's not even capable
of getting himself to Washington,
let alone harming the president.
It's ridiculous.
He's like, yeah, but he wrote the letter.
He goes in it, and this is what I was told
that he said, that the judge said, he goes,
the fact that he wanted to rape the dog
is disturbing to me.
He goes, so, he said, I'm gonna give him what he wants though.
That was the golden ticket of the letter.
He is going to federal prison.
Right after you finish your state prison stint,
you're gonna get seven years in the feds.
That's why he was in the feds.
Hey, angle your mic a little bit up more.
Oh.
Just a little bit straight up more.
Like that?
Like this.
That?
Oh, okay.
Okay, so.
That's hilarious.
That's ridiculous.
So is that how he got the Mr. Freeze?
Or was he?
No, no, Mr. Freeze was because he.
Voluntarily.
Actually, that, no, it works.
It works, right?
Yeah, he did get the AC.
He got the AC, so that's Mr. Freeze.
And then they had another guy named Itchy.
Itchy was a black guy who had hair that he never combed.
It was just like a rock.
And Itchy was schizophrenic.
Itchy, like, you know, you have all this stuff.
Like an afro?
Like an afro, but it's just like rock.
Like he never walked like it was so hard.
You know, if they don't, they gotta pick it out and stuff.
Yeah, yeah.
It just gets like knotted up.
It's like a big dreadlock.
He's like a homeless guy in prison.
And you know, they have all these walkways.
Itchy would walk right across the grass.
If I walked across the grass, I'm going to the shoe.
Itchy would walk right across the grass.
And the cops would be like, Itchy, Itchy, Itchy!
And he'd, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
And he had a catchphrase, which was,
I still want my dick sucked.
So the cops would yell at him and they'd be like,
Itchy, come here.
And he'd walk over, what, what?
They'd go, I told you not to walk across.
Now you go down this slide walk and he'd go,
all right, all right.
And he'd be fine.
He'd start walking off.
He'd go, I still want my dick sucked.
And they'd be like, Itchy!
I mean, it happened.
He was, he was, he was crazy.
He'd walk up and start yelling at guys to give him coffee.
They knew he was crazy.
How old was this guy?
Oh, he had to be in his 40s or 50s.
Jesus.
So I was on, at the time I was taking a paxil.
And I was still, I was taking paxil and I was,
I was doing that.
Paxil is what?
It's a for, it's a for depression and social anxiety.
So I have social anxiety.
I don't like large crowds.
I'm in prison.
I'm in prison.
Right.
So I'm really happy.
Imagine that.
Imagine that.
And I'm, and I suffer from depression.
So not good.
So I'm, I'm in, what they call pill line.
So I'm standing in pill line one day
and Itchy just walks right across the grass.
Everybody's screaming at him.
He walks right in the front of the thing.
Everybody backs up.
Like they're all like, oh, he walked straight to the front line,
gets his pills, gets his pills, takes his pills
and walks right back to the unit.
Never really left the unit much, except to go get pills.
Well, there's this guy going, man, that guy's fucking crazy.
And there was a new guy had just come to prison
and he got like five or six years.
I don't even know why he was in the, the medium.
He probably shouldn't have even been there.
And I looked at him and I went, bro, I said,
he goes, man, that guy's, he's, he's messed up.
He's like a homeless guy.
He's all fucked up.
And I go, bro, that guy right there?
Keep in mind, most of your time is,
is spent trying to entertain yourself.
So you, you do stuff you would stay busy,
stay busy to, to keep yourself entertained,
find things that are funny or interesting,
read books, whatever.
So I'm sitting there and I go, that guy?
I go, bro, that guy used to own banks in the Cayman Islands.
And he goes, are you serious?
I went, yeah, bro.
I said, he was like, like the cover of like Forbes magazine
and he had a fucking Jets.
And yeah, I said, he used to, you know, like 10 banks.
He was laundering money.
I go, that dude's a fucking genius.
That's fucking itchy.
And he goes, he goes, well, he's crazy.
I said, well, bro, some people,
this guy was complaining about how much time he got,
like four years or five years.
And I go, well, some people can't handle the time.
They just snap.
And he was like, fuck.
So I'm just fucking with him, right?
No, it's not, it's cause he's already been,
he's like, I don't think I can do all this time.
I got like four years.
It's like four years.
Shut up, man.
I'm gonna talk to me.
So you turned yourself in.
You know what I mean, guys?
I know that turned themselves in.
They got like 10, 15 years and turned themselves in.
You got 15 years and you turned yourself, run.
Yeah.
Give it a shot.
You already got your time.
I can't even talk to that guy.
So this guy's, so anyway, I tell him a couple of days later,
I'm in the chow hall and I'm sitting at a table
with a couple of guys and itchy walks in, walks up,
grabs his fucking meal and walks off
and sits down at a table.
I mean, like, itchy was so nasty and disgusting.
No one sat by him.
He'd sit at a table.
Everybody would get up and move.
Yeah.
Cause he's like, you know.
So, and you didn't wait in line.
So that he gets his food, sits down,
and the guy, another guy I don't know
is telling another guy, saying,
boy, that guy, that guy owned like 50 fucking banks.
He's worth a billion dollars.
The story just goes off, right?
The story was like, he was on the cover of Fortune, Forbes.
Wow.
Private Jets and I'm like.
So someone took your story and just fucking,
just run with it.
It's crazy.
That's amazing.
Yeah, that is, it's hilarious.
So, what was it she actually in for?
Did you already say that?
I have no idea.
He's probably crack head and is in some conspiracy.
You'd be shocked.
Every once in a while there's some crack head
that's like, how did you even commit a federal crime?
It's like, well, he happened to be one of 30 guys
on a conspiracy.
He's the lowest man on the top.
He's the guy that is running back and forth
and the DEA comes in and guess what?
You just got a federal crime.
It should be a state crime,
but the DEA was investigating the top dogs
and your name's one of the many.
They know you'll cooperate.
What do I wanna ask you about?
Depression.
Oh yeah, you said you were doing depression meds in there.
Are there a lot of people that commit suicide in prison?
Is that a regular thing?
Is that like a concern?
Like the guy was like, don't drink,
don't drink the fucking, the liquid.
Probably in the pen, there's a lot more like mutilation.
Guys will cut their themselves, their fucking dicks off.
What?
Oh yeah, that's something.
Did Jeffrey Epstein commit suicide?
Did you know I'm getting people
that are saying that in the comments?
Really?
You need to investigate Epstein's.
You should.
Okay.
Was he murdered?
Anyway, so.
We don't even wanna touch on that one.
So there's a.
That prison's gnarly looking.
It's a fucking tower.
That prison that he was in,
the Metropolitan Prison in New York.
Yeah, most prisons are.
Not Coleman, Coleman's like this long flat.
Coleman's nice.
Plenty of space, it's a decent prison.
Yeah.
Anybody that goes to Coleman and complains, they're just.
How many prisons are like that prison that Epstein was in,
where it's just like a fucking tower?
Oh, oh, I don't know, I don't know.
I don't know how many.
He was in rich people prison, right?
No, that was not a rich people prison.
No.
No, not this time.
His first bid, he barely did any time at all.
Like he had to stay at the prison like five days a week
or something, just sleep there.
Really?
Yeah, his first time he got in trouble.
You can come in during like the week and leave on the weekends
or vice versa.
On the weekend, he had to stay there,
but during the week, he was allowed to leave it
like seven or eight in the morning
and come back at seven or eight at night.
He got to work, he only really slept there during the week.
I didn't know that was a thing.
No, it's not a thing.
He had such an overwhelming amount of money
and legal talent that they made this sweetheart deal.
And of course, he gets out and starts doing it again.
He's got a sickness.
Instead of saying, hey, I got to pass,
I need to go fly straight, it just emboldened him.
So, okay, so the prison,
oh, as far as, you mean the pill line thing?
Like the pills?
Yeah, no, I was asking about suicide
and that led just right into the Epstein.
Yeah, it's fucking broke.
There's lots of people on pills.
Do you think Epstein really killed himself?
I have no idea.
What are you doing?
What would you guess?
I don't know, I want to talk about it.
It's a hot topic out there.
It's a hot topic, it's relevant, Matt.
This is a good clip.
This is a YouTube clip.
This is a viral clip.
Barely read anything about Epstein.
You did it?
Yeah, no, of course, I saw the news.
There was a couple of articles.
They're questioning it, nobody knows.
The guard was there, he had threatened suicide.
Do you think Hillary could have paid off the guards
to fucking kill him?
He killed himself.
You really did?
Yes, of course.
You think the camera's just randomly malfunctioned in there?
Yeah, and they malfunctioned.
Half of them cameras don't fucking work, bro.
You understand, you know that the towers?
Yeah, he's high profile.
You know the towers?
You don't think they make sure
that cameras are working, man,
when Jeffrey Epstein was in there.
I think that the place was run by idiots.
Nobody gets to the top of their field
and ends up working at the BOP.
Nobody.
How the cameras are never working.
Do you know how understaffed they are?
Do you know that the pens,
all the pens have towers, right?
Nobody's in them.
Nobody stays in them.
So you don't really?
Yeah, you don't think he was murdered.
They've been in fear for like 10 years.
Holy shit.
No, no, I don't think he was murdered.
Maybe he was, I don't know.
Yeah, but they said his neck was like severe,
I don't know, I didn't pay enough attention,
they said his neck was literally fucking snapped.
We're not gonna solve it.
We're not gonna solve it.
Matt, you might be able to solve this.
Matt, if there's anyone who can solve this,
it's fucking you, man.
I don't think so.
Did you see what happened to his neck?
Did you look into what happened to his neck?
No, I didn't, but I'm sure I could order
his autopsy report.
You and me guys autopsy report.
Can we just do a whole podcast on Epstein?
You would have to order Freedom Information Act.
You'd have to hear it.
How much for that cost?
We don't need those people showing up here.
The cost isn't anything, it's free.
Basically free.
Okay.
The only time I've ever been denied
the Freedom of Information Act is Frank Amadeo.
CIA, everybody was like, no, national security.
And you don't think they'll do that for Epstein?
They got to.
No, because why, it's a, it's a,
it was a-
But they say he had dirt on everybody.
Yeah, but if they're saying it was a suicide,
then the autopsy report and the suicide report
and the blood, whatever, where they test his blood,
all that's public records.
You can get all that.
Okay.
But of course they're gonna say that, right?
What?
Well, I mean, if they've done it right,
it's all doctored anyway.
You ain't ever gonna know.
Even if the real killer came out
and admitted it right now,
there's so much stuff that points away from it,
they'd never believe him.
It'd just be another conspiracy.
You'd never go away.
Somebody in there has an arts degree
that forms the paperwork.
Some guy with fine arts degree dummied up everything.
Right, all the whole paperwork.
Holy shit.
Oh my God.
That's gonna be a good clip.
Oh my God, that's ridiculous.
You know what, you know what I was thinking about
when you said, talked about the,
the depression medication?
Yeah.
Is that they changed providers at one point
for the depression medication.
Could you imagine being the fucking pill company
that sells to the prisons?
To the prison bureau?
Oh my God.
Wow, they're printing money.
The same ones that the fucking,
they'd probably write out of Florida.
You know, there's certain rules
that like they have to pay top dollar.
Like the,
The prisons do?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't get great.
Anyway, they go through like,
what is it, PIOs or IPO, what are those?
An IPO?
No, for the fucking,
the HMOs or something, not HMOs, what am I talking about?
Basically,
Like insurance?
Yeah, for your medical.
Yeah.
Right.
So it's not like they're just giving them.
So not all inmates can get them.
They have to have a certain,
they have to pay for insurance.
No, basically.
You guys just gotta qualify for it.
The prison,
No, you're getting your,
you're getting whatever you're supposed to get.
They just have some kind of different insurance carriers
in the prison system where they're,
they're, they're providing insurance.
That's where all your tax dollars are going to.
So,
so they switched providers.
This is what I was told.
Who fucking knows with these guys?
So not all inmates can get medication at the prison.
Yeah, of course they can get.
Of course, all of them.
Okay, so the prisons have to buy the insurance.
The prisons have insurance.
They cover the whole prison.
Yeah, you don't make any money.
Got it, okay, I got it.
You don't make any money then.
Your fucking relatives can pay for it, right?
No.
Your mom can't give you commentary
that pays for your pills and shit.
No, they wouldn't allow that
because that would mean that the rich people
are getting better care than the poor people.
Right, okay.
You gotta go see them nurse the whole night.
That's why I asked these questions.
I don't know the answers.
I got, that's how I learned.
It's the great equalizer.
Okay.
You could be fucking a multi-multi-millionaire.
You're sleeping on the top bunk.
Got it.
Doesn't matter if I shit.
I've been here two years.
It's the great equalizer.
Fuck you.
You know, I mean, you're, you know,
I'm a grade one
and I'm making 60 bucks a month
and you come in and you're doing the same job
but you just got here, you're making $15 a month.
You know what I'm saying?
It's, trust me, there's just very little,
you can maybe put money on other people's books,
which you're not allowed to do
and you can get somebody to maybe clean your room,
do your laundry, make your life a little bit easier
but it ain't gonna be much easier.
The best it could be is still shit.
Yeah, right.
You know?
Still locked up.
So they changed providers.
Yeah, they changed providers one.
And so they put me, they switched me from Paxil
to like Welbutron.
Well, Welbutron, I didn't like it.
It made me feel weird.
And then I switched to...
The batter all in there?
Then they switched me to something else.
They switched me to another thing.
Then they switched me to like Zoloft or something.
I tried to take that
and I felt like I didn't, I couldn't follow conversation.
So this went on for like three months.
Finally I just said, you know what?
Fuck it, I'm not gonna take it anymore.
I'm just gonna see what happens.
Yeah.
And then I've been dealing with it ever since
and I was telling Stacey.
Are you still taking those meds?
I don't take anything.
That's good.
You don't take anything.
That's just bullshit.
That's just so fucking, so bad for you.
Yeah, but here's the difference.
Where before when I was taking Paxil,
everything was okay.
I'm okay.
Yeah.
Everything's good.
My house burned down.
Oh man, that's horrible.
I hope nobody was hurt.
I mean, just didn't affect me.
Everybody used to say, nothing bothers you.
You don't, and I didn't obsess about anything.
Just like a zombie or something.
Right, because I was, well, I wasn't a zombie
but it levels you off.
I felt okay.
And now this is what I'm saying.
Now the difference is, I wake up at five in the morning,
my alarm goes off, but I don't get out of bed
till about 5.15, 5.20,
because I spend about 15 or 20 minutes telling myself,
it's gonna be okay.
Give me my name, I'm in prison.
When I was in prison, it was 10 times worse.
I would lay in bed and I'd go, oh my God,
I'm still in prison.
I'd be like, it's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
And you know, I would lay in bed,
my first thought was honestly,
how much dental floss do I have to buy
to weave a rope to kill myself in the bathroom
at two o'clock in the morning?
Cause that's when you can do it.
There's a pole over the handicap stall
that's high enough that you can actually,
you could actually hang yourself and you'd be done.
That's the only real spot to do it.
I mean, it was that bad in the mornings.
So I would be like, how much dental floss do I have to buy?
And I would sit there and I'd go,
what are you, it's not rational.
What are you thinking?
And I was like, I can't do this, I can't do this.
And you just go over in your head
and go over and go over it.
And then I'd say, just get some coffee.
It's okay, it's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna get some coffee, just get some coffee.
So I'd get myself out of bed
and I'd just go, just get some coffee.
You can always do this, just get your coffee.
Get some coffee, you get a little bit better.
And it still is like, I can't do this, I can't do this.
And I'd think, no, I gotta meet so-and-so today.
I'd get dressed and then I'd go to the library.
I'd work with somebody or I'd write something.
And then by the time Recall came around
where they call you back to the unit at 10 o'clock,
I'd be like, it's okay, it's okay.
You can do it, you can get through the day,
you can get through the day.
And this is the conversations going in my fucking,
while I'm talking to you,
this is what's going on in the back of my head.
You can do this, you can do this, you can do this,
you can do this, it's gonna be okay.
It's gonna stop thinking like that.
Stop thinking it's not rational.
And so by the time lunch comes, I mean in lunch, it's okay.
This is good, they got apple pie.
I like apple pie, you're fine.
Tonight they're gonna have fried chicken.
They make good fried chicken here.
It's good, it's okay, it's okay.
By two or three o'clock, you're like, I'm feel okay.
I can do this, I can, I'm okay.
By five o'clock or six o'clock when I'm eating,
I'm like, it's good, you're locked up with some good guys.
You like Greg, Greg's a cool guy.
Jimmy's all right, he always makes me laugh.
By eight o'clock, they got the movie on the night,
it's good, I love that movie, it's James Bond, it's great.
By nine o'clock, you're thinking things are going good.
I got this in the courts, this is happening.
So-and-so's doing this.
I might be able to make it out by 10 o'clock.
I'm kicking ass, I'm getting out of this fucking place.
I'm gonna fucking hit the streets,
I'm gonna write these fucking stories,
everything's gonna be fucking amazing,
I'm gonna sell fucking options,
I'm gonna fucking kick ass,
I'm gonna be driving a fucking Ferrari,
I'm gonna be driving a 22-year-old,
fucking extra, I'm gonna be fucking amazing
when I get out.
They're gonna buy or they're gonna fucking die.
And by the next morning, how much fucking dental floss
do I have to buy?
Every day.
This went on the whole fucking time,
and I was telling Stacey the other day about it,
and she was, she was well,
but you don't think that anymore,
and I went, oh, I still lay in bed till 5, 5, 15, 5, 20.
Telling myself, it's okay,
I'm not thinking about getting dental floss,
I'm thinking, does Stacey have a gun in the house?
They wouldn't let her, I know she doesn't have a gun.
They're just for a brief second.
But-
You know what I'm saying?
I gotta see a psychiatrist, right?
I got-
A lot of people see psychiatrists,
I mean that's a normal thing though.
I got court-ordered fucking psychiatrist.
But I'm saying a lot of people,
a lot of really successful people use psychiatrists now
as like a weekly ritual,
that's because it's good for your mental health,
like it's okay now to talk about,
like people do that.
It's popular now.
It's a lot more popular now.
I mean, yeah, well mine's court-ordered, so.
Yeah, so.
But it's good, like, you know,
it's good for you, you should do it
even if it wasn't court-ordered.
I guess.
Do you do it now?
I don't know.
No, I have to do it.
You have to do it, it's court-ordered.
Are you a CSI psychiatrist?
Fuck yeah, bro, listen,
if I could get to that story on here,
you can't believe how that-
It's cool to see a shrink.
It's not cool, I gotta drive to fucking Brandon.
She's not gonna help me.
She thinks they think they're gonna fucking help me.
I'm 50 years old, I'm fucked up.
I mean, it's over, and I'm not trying.
So, you know, it's all, I'm all fucking jammed up.
But, like, I shot myself in the foot
with this fucking psychiatrist, bro.
Like, I'm done now.
Like, I bet just the next five years
I'm going to this psychiatrist,
they're not letting me out, my fucking-
Yeah, you're supposed to tell them what they want in here,
not what you're actually doing.
It doesn't feel good to go out to go there.
What do you talk about?
I already know you told that story,
and I read it on here, and I remember,
I remember, I'm like, you should've never told them that, man.
Oh, fuck, what a fucking idiot.
I totally was just like, what the-
Yeah, come on, man.
I didn't know that.
How am I supposed to know?
You know, keep in mind, you're going through the process.
Well, yeah, now I know.
So, anyway, so that was the, yeah, that was the,
you know, here's the thing.
I wrote this whole fucking thing.
We were just shooting this shit.
This is ridiculous.
This is all bad.
I've never won so far.
No.
Oh my god.
Because it's ADD, we don't have to follow any kind of story.
Oh my god.
It's ridiculous.
No, but what I was saying, what I was going to say is,
I thought people with your type of,
with your personality type, the narcissist, sociopathic,
personality type, they don't want,
they're not going to kill themselves.
They're self-preserving personalities.
That's why it's very brief.
It doesn't last the whole day.
I mean, it's like, you know, it gets very,
it gets better right away, you know,
within 10 minutes, five, 10 minutes.
And it was horrible in prison.
Initially, it wasn't until I started writing
and feeling good about myself again,
that it was really, really wasn't, it was still bad,
but it wasn't that bad.
Right.
Keep in mind, the writing really helped it.
Oh, fucking, the writing, it gave me purpose.
Right, it gave you, yeah.
It didn't matter.
I was achieving something.
So all that mattered was, you know,
that's the worst thing about prison for me,
is that the worst thing for prison for me
was that I wasn't achieving anything.
You know, I don't really have a family
that I'm kept away from.
Like if you're married with three kids
and you get a year, you're going to do harder time
than I'll do in 10 years, if I have nobody on the street.
I knew a guy one time, he got arrested.
He'd already done like state time one time
if he did like three, four years.
He's dating this girl, he gets jammed up,
he's gonna have to do five years.
He's gonna do the drug program,
he said I'll be out in about three years,
maybe two and a half to three years.
First thing he did was,
as soon as he had to turn himself in,
his girlfriend drives him to drop him off,
he tells her, we're done.
She's like, what?
He goes, I know you think you're gonna write me letters
and this and this, but it's over.
I'm not calling you, I'm not writing you.
We're over, it's over.
I'm sorry, I love you.
Find somebody else.
He didn't want to have to deal with that
when he was in there.
Because he'd been through it before,
and he said, it made my time so hard.
Because you end up being the guy
that's calling on Friday night,
and she's not answering.
And so the next day you're calling,
you're like, where were you?
What the fuck are you?
It's torture, right?
It's torture.
It's fucking torture.
Right, better off, just don't call.
No, she's with someone else.
He's like, look, when I get out,
if you're available, that's great.
Listen, the real reason I knew that was,
he was getting two, three letters a day.
He's getting me out there calling his name three times.
She's sending pictures of them.
She's writing letters.
This went on for like two, three weeks
while I was locked up with the guy.
Then I got transferred to a prison.
This was when I was bumping,
I was jumping your bump from one prison
to another to another, or to jails,
while they're trying to move you to where you want.
No, what I wanted to say about the depression stuff,
I think it's interesting how you found your way
through the depression through finding a purpose in life.
You found your purpose in your calling
and you wanted to write stories.
You had a fucking goal, you were passionate about it.
That got you through the fucking shit.
You didn't need the depression pills anymore.
I think a lot of people leaving YouTube comments
have that same fucking problem.
I mean, maybe, maybe.
A lot of people in the country,
a lot of people in the country,
they don't have that.
They don't have something.
They don't have a purpose.
They have their job.
Right, and they're fucking.
They get to watch and they get to make mean comments
on fucking YouTube.
Right, and they're unhappy and they're fucking unhappy.
Yeah, well, to me, I gotta have purpose.
I gotta be doing something.
I gotta be creating something.
Everybody, I mean, most people do.
Yeah, I would think, but you'd be shocked
how many people are just happy going to their job
and their purpose is just getting through life.
To me, it's just to be myself entertained.
A lot of people, a lot of women, like my wife,
she just wants to fucking raise a kid and raise her family
and she wants to, that's her purpose.
That makes her happy.
A lot of people, right, that'd be nice.
You could wake up every day and not go to work
and fucking chill out at the house.
Wouldn't want to be a man.
It ain't easy, right?
That ain't fucking easy.
That's a hard fucking work.
That's a tough, yeah.
It's nice to.
I feel like my job's a cakewalk
compared to doing that, like, holy shit.
But here's the problem is,
because you're not designed like that.
Your job's a cakewalk compared to 99 other people.
You know what I mean?
It's like you're not set up like,
like, I mean, I know, like, like Stacey.
Stacey loves to make food.
She loves to make food.
Is everything okay?
Do you need this?
You know, have you guys eaten?
She loves to be like a mom.
She's a mom to everybody.
Same thing with my wife.
And to me, it's like, you know, if somebody's like,
hey, I'm hungry.
Oh, go get yourself something to fucking eat.
What are you telling me for?
You know, I'm not, I'm not Finia.
I'm not making your food.
I'm not, are you nuts?
She would, anybody walk in and be like,
I'm kind of hungry.
Oh my gosh, I just made this.
I just, do you need this?
Yeah, there's a wah-wah down the street.
Yeah, that's crazy.
So that's just stuff you don't like about.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
For women.
For women, it's different.
They're designed like they like their motherly.
Some of them aren't.
Some of them, not all.
What's the worst thing you saw in prison?
We talked about that, didn't we?
Well, you know what I was gonna tell you,
which is, it was this one, which is actually
probably detrimental to me.
What was detrimental to you?
In page one?
Yeah, but comical.
It's comical only because,
really hope this doesn't come back.
Is that, when I first got locked up,
like, people in the comments have mentioned this.
They're like, does he have to pay back those money he owes?
Oh yeah.
And I'm like, fuck it.
Wouldn't he mention about the restitution, right?
Yeah, well, I'm, yeah, exactly.
So I got locked up, while you're locked up,
you say you got, you owe $5 million.
Well, I don't even know what restitution means.
Restitution is like, how much money are your victims out?
So you stole money or scam people out of money.
You stole 10 million.
You gotta pay that money back.
Right, and here's the worst part is that,
let's say you have 10 different co-definance
and everybody got $600,000.
So you think, okay, everybody owes $600,000.
They don't do it like that.
They say, you owe $6 million.
Every one of you owe $6 million.
You're all paying until it's paid off.
You're like, wait, what if fucking Danny
never pays a fucking dime,
well then you're gonna pay the $6 million.
And you think that's unfair and they go,
well, fucking tough shit.
You don't have the same rights
as a normal citizen anymore.
We can be unfair to you.
You owe $6 million and everybody's gonna pay in
until it's all paid off.
We're not gonna divvy it up.
But I got $5 million and he got $2 million.
That doesn't matter, you're all paying.
So what ends up happening is I ended up having
all these co-definance that didn't get charged.
There's like 15, 16 co-definance on my indictment
that didn't get, that didn't get indicted.
They got indicted, but they never got charged.
They never went through.
I ended up with the $6 million.
So I owe $6 million.
Well, so-and-so got $500,000.
So-and-so got $300,000.
So-and-so got a million.
How are you hitting me with the whole six?
Well, you're fucked.
You're just fucked.
And at the time when you take your plea,
you're so desperate to try and get a good deal.
I'm not gonna complain about money at this point.
But as soon as you go to, as soon as you go to,
as soon as you go into prison,
first thing they do when you meet your counselor
is they say, okay, well, you have to pay every month
or every quarter, you have to pay,
here's how much money you get in,
and here's our calculation.
So you're gonna be paying $25 every month.
Or $50 a quarter.
Towards your restitution.
Towards your restitution.
$50 towards my-
Six million.
$6 million.
And how am I gonna pay this?
Well, I don't know.
You're gonna have to get a job.
And you go, well, I have a job.
I make $12 a month.
So I make $12 a month.
In prison.
In prison, and you wanna hit me every quarter
for $50 a quarter.
That's everything I made.
Yeah.
And they're like, yeah, I know.
I mean, I could maybe lower it to 25.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm supposed to work 40 hours a week.
And at the end of the month,
I'm supposed to get $6?
Yeah.
This is ridiculous.
Wow.
What if I need to buy toothpaste?
What if I need to buy, deodorant?
What if you need to buy fucking dangerous shampoo
or nail clippers?
Not to mention shower slides.
Or any type of hygiene.
So you're just-
Right, basic hygiene.
You can't even afford that.
You're just fucked.
Oh, you can use the state stuff.
They don't give you shower slides.
Yeah.
Guys, you're giving-
They're amazing is the amount of charity
that the other inmates give one another.
Hey, bro, I saw you don't have shower slides.
I got an extra pair.
You can use them till you get some from Commissary.
You're like, man, thank you.
You get them, you go get them, you bring them back.
No problem.
You know, they'll say, hey, I got some soups.
I got this.
So you get there and guys are like, here's some soup.
Here's this, here's that.
They'll like have, the Mexicans are the best.
Really?
One Mexican comes in.
All of them come in.
They'll walk in, they'll have a bag of shit
for the other Mexicans.
They like take care of each other.
That's cool.
So, yeah, so what ends up happening
is the first time I go to my counselor.
I go into my counselor's office and I walk in.
I mean, keep in mind, I'm just, I'm fucking beat.
I mean, I got 20 fucking six years, bro.
It's, I'm just depressed as fuck all.
Your bro-
It's crushed.
Furious, angry, bitter, get in there
and Miss Smalls, was it Miss Smalls?
No, no, Miss Bates was my very first counselor.
And she says, okay, she goes through everything.
Yeah, you gotta get a job.
You gotta start doing this, start doing that, blah, blah, blah.
Okay, okay.
I'm like, all right, all right.
She's like, and you gotta pay restitution.
And I went, well, no, I don't have to pay restitution.
She's like, yeah, I'll put you on.
She goes, you don't have very much money in right now.
So I'm gonna hit you for 25 bucks a quarter initially.
She's then we'll bump it up once.
You'll have a job, you'll probably get bumped up.
And I went, no, no, I said, I'm not paying restitution.
She says, no, you have to pay restitution.
She says, if you don't pay restitution,
you can't go to commissary, you can't use the phone.
They start doing all this shit
where you're basically trapped in there.
You have no way to do anything.
And I'm like, I just got 20 fucking six years
and these motherfuckers are gonna cut off,
cut you off completely from everything.
And you're like, and I went, no, no, I'm not saying
I won't pay, I'm saying, I don't have to pay.
She says, what do you mean?
I said, well, I said, my lawyer made the argument
that I didn't have to pay the interest on the six million,
nor did I have to start making payments
until I was released from prison.
And she goes, I've never seen that before.
I said, well, it was a new judge
and she said she was gonna try it out.
And that was one of the only arguments she won.
So I know it's, I remember specifically
because she was happy about it.
And I remember thinking, big deal.
I said, but you know, I'm glad she won it.
And she goes, she looks down and she goes,
okay, well, I don't have your file in yet.
So I'm gonna check and I'll check your judgment commitment
to see if you have to pay it or not.
I said, I know I don't have to pay it.
I said, I can get my transcripts
and I'll show you, I don't have to pay it.
She's okay, well, I'll wait till I get the judgment
commitment and I'll check it out.
I said, okay.
So she says, I'll call you in next week
or I'll take a look at it and we'll talk next week.
Okay, so she dies.
Oh my God.
A few weeks later.
What are the odds?
She dies.
So I go in, so three, four, five months later,
she dies obviously, and she wasn't that old.
She was like 50 something,
but she's out there smoking all the time.
She literally goes in, does something, comes out,
smokes two cigarettes, goes in.
I mean, it was ridiculous.
She's so reticent of nicotine.
And to be honest, I think it may have been
several months later.
So it was several months, she never called me in.
And several months, I think it was several months later,
she died.
So then a few months later,
because it was a couple months later,
my next team, they call it team.
You have to go every six months to team.
So you go in, and I go in, and they're like,
hey, my name's Mr. Garcia, I'm your new case manager,
or no, you're your new counselor,
and you go in, there's multiple people there.
There's a case manager, there's a unit manager,
there's a counselor.
And I go, okay, and they go, okay,
Cox, we noticed that you're not paying your restitution.
I went, right, right, I said, yeah, I don't have to.
And they go, what do you mean you don't have to?
I said, no, no.
I said, I explained the whole thing
how my lawyer had won.
That's complete bullshit, by the way.
You made it up.
I made it up, complete fucking lie.
But I mean, I don't want to pay, I have no money,
and I don't want them to fucking jam me out.
You're selling it.
Yeah, so I said, no, no, no, this and this,
and they go, okay, I said, Ms. Base, check it out.
And they go, okay, keep my files right here.
But this is a great thing about the laziness.
The same way I got the fake,
the kid's social security numbers issued,
and all that shit.
The laziness of government work.
The laziness, your file is right here, open the file.
I'm like, bro, you can check right now.
I said, look at my judgment commitment, I don't have to.
I dare you to check it.
Yeah, he goes, no, no, I'll check it out.
He goes, I'll let you know.
I said, okay, so we get up and leave.
So there's three people, three of them there,
none of them can check the file, I get up and leave.
Six months later, I come back.
Hey, Cox, I know it's been here a year,
you're not paying your judge, I said,
it's new people.
And I go, don't you remember last time I said,
I told you about that I don't have to pay my judge,
the judgment commitment, I said, you checked it out.
I said, don't you remember?
One of the fucking guys there goes,
oh, that's right, I remember him talking about that.
They're like, yeah, yeah, I said, remember,
Miss Bates checked it out and I don't have to pay.
I said, you were here, I said, remember,
we looked at the judgment commitment and he goes,
yeah, yeah, I do remember, I do remember that,
that's right, that's right, yeah, he didn't have to pay,
he didn't have to pay, oh, okay, okay.
That counselor gets moved, a new counselor comes in,
next team, same thing, boom, I hit him again.
Okay, well, I'll check it out,
I'll call you next week, okay, no problem, no problem.
Next, this goes on for three years.
They then move me to the low.
I get there, I got a guy named, my counselor, Smith,
fat guy, what a prick, this guy, I mean,
I told you how the guards get meaner and meaner
as you go down, I go and I sit down and he goes,
okay, so you got, what, you got a, holy shit,
he goes, you got 26 years, he goes,
your nuts are gonna be hanging down by your knees
by the time you get out of here.
You ain't gonna see Pussy for fucking another,
yes, like, 20 years.
That's what he said to you.
I'm going, the fuck is this mother fat piece of shit?
I'm looking at him going.
How long are you in for at this point?
I've already done four years.
Right, okay.
I still got 20 years to go, I got moved to the low
because I was now below 20,
so I'm at like 19 years and 10 months.
Yeah.
And he's, and I'm like, holy shit, I mean, just brutal.
So, and he said, he's like, yeah,
hey, what's up with this restitution?
And I went, he goes, you're not paying me a restitution?
He goes, why aren't you on it?
They call it FRP refusal,
where they shut down all your accounts.
You can't, you can't buy phone minutes.
You can't do all kinds of shit.
You can't do anything.
Right.
So, and he's like, why aren't you on refusal?
I said, I don't have to pay.
And he goes, no, you have to.
I said, no, no, I said, I explained how we won the argument.
I don't have to pay, because I've never seen that.
I went, I said, what do you think happened?
I said, do you think that for the past four years?
Right.
I said, I've been scamming these people and not have to pay.
I said, I've had four counselors look at it,
case managers, I said, and a unit managers.
I said, they're all looking at it.
I said, I don't have to pay.
I go, check it out.
And he goes, I will, I'll let you know.
So then a few days later, I have to go to see my unit manager.
No, my case manager, I go into my case manager,
she's mean as a snake.
Her name was Jenkins.
So Ms. Jenkins, remember she said,
she has, you know, after reading your,
she has, after reading your,
and keep in mind, I'm still irritated.
I've been irritated for about five years now and depressed.
Four years now.
Remember, she looked at my, what's called my PSI,
and she looks at it, she says,
and after looking at your PSI and all this crime,
they even had another packet to my PSI.
It's like 50 pages.
It's like, this is your PSI,
and we got a fucking supplement.
It's so big.
There's so much fraud.
She goes, she says, makes me want to hide my wallet.
And I go, why?
And she goes, I go, why?
She goes, for my credit, she goes to hide my credit cards.
I go, I've never stole anybody's credit cards.
And I go, I'll take your house like that.
And she goes, well,
I think they should have strung you up by the flagpole.
I go, well, thank God you're not in charge of that.
What are we doing?
And she's like, well,
I don't know who you were talking to.
So we were bickering.
She goes, why aren't you paying your restitution?
Just in my case, my counselor walks in and I go, ask him.
I said, he checked the file.
I said, I don't have, I said,
and she goes, why didn't he pay in his restitution?
I go, I said, you saw my judgment commitment.
He goes, yeah, yeah, I looked at judgment commitment.
He goes, it's, he doesn't have to pay.
He said, it's weird.
I've never seen it before,
but he fucking total lied.
He never looked at shit
because I know for a fact it doesn't say that.
Right, because you lied about it.
I've been lying the whole time.
You just put him on the spot.
And yeah, what's he gonna say?
It's been a week and I haven't looked.
I'm a lazy shit.
No, he can't say that.
Oh my God, dude.
I said, he saw it.
I said, I mean, what's it, what do you guys think?
You know, and she goes, she's like,
He just exploited their laziness.
And he says, he goes, yeah, yeah, he said,
yeah, he doesn't have to pay.
He doesn't have to pay.
He said, he hasn't paid in four years like that.
He said, yeah, he said, and I go,
I said, can you mark my file or something?
Because I have this conversation every six months.
She goes, I'll make a note.
This guy retires two years later.
Next counselor comes in.
I know he's gonna catch his names.
Counselor Kerry, he is a stickler.
He's a total bureaucrat.
He's pulling guys in left and right, redoing their FRP.
Guys are walking out, out of his office, screaming,
about how he's raising their FRP.
And I'm thinking, I'm just waiting.
This guy's gonna cut your head off.
Never, no.
No, she's got it in the system.
It's in the system.
Next person, next person, next person, next person.
I got so fucking lucky.
I didn't get caught until I was in R-Dap.
Literally, we're talking about a year before.
The fucking R-Dap.
The drug program.
They caught, they catch it at Grand Prairie,
which is like, okay, sorry.
They catch it like.
Which is how many years later.
Like, fucking, like, they was like,
I never paid.
I mean, I paid, I made two payments the whole time I was there.
Yeah.
Why, why'd you even make two?
I only made two because they caught it.
I was in R-Dap and I was gonna get kicked out of R-Dap.
So I said, look, so when the guy brings me in,
he's like, look, man, we can't take,
we can't take the year off you,
or we can't keep you in the program.
We should pay something.
Unless you start paying.
He goes, now, Cox, he goes, you get in about $300.
Keep in mind too, keep in mind.
Understand, I've sold an option at this point.
Remember the option money?
The, I was a part of that option.
For war dogs?
No, no, not for war dogs.
For Generation Ox, he got sold.
I got a piece of the option.
So I'm getting money sent in, three, 400 bucks a month.
And I'm typing, I'm writing these books and everything.
So I'm getting money sent in.
So I got two, 300 bucks a month coming in.
Nice.
So he's like, so you're getting a bunch of money coming in.
You can pay a hundred bucks a month, a hundred bucks a month.
And I'm like, so he's like, look,
so we can start arguing.
He wants like 150.
I get him down to like a hundred.
And I say, listen, let's do this.
I can do, I'll do it, but give me some time.
You know what, this is, this is the guy, this is,
and I told him this, listen, this is so fucked up.
This lets you know their mentality.
Did you just turn the light on?
That fucking bulb's fucked up.
Oh, you should see me.
Did I tell you that I got a short in my radio?
I can, I hit my dash and my radio comes on.
I feel like Fonzie.
Oh, wow, crazy.
So, so he says, so he's sitting there and I go,
I go, whoa, whoa, I said, my mother sends me money
out of her social security stipend every month.
She makes, gets 1,100 bucks completely.
I go, $1,100.
I go, and she sends me $300.
I go, so the question I'm asking you is I go,
you're telling me you want my mother to pay $150
towards my restitution every month.
And he goes, that's exactly what I'm telling you,
tell your mother to pay 150 bucks a month.
And I went, well, okay, I'll,
I was like, this guy is heartless.
He's not cutting over it.
So I said, bro, you've got to at least hold it off
for three months.
I said, give me some time.
I mean, and he's like, okay, we'll do it
in like October or something.
So then I knew by October I would be able
to get out of the program.
And so like the day before I transferred all my money out
and put it on like different, like I bought true links.
I bought phone, I bought everything I could.
So when the 150 came, bam, it completely bounced.
There's no money in the house.
There's nothing in ice.
Fucking furious, bro.
They're furious at me, call me in.
What are you doing?
And I was like, I mean, there's nothing you can do.
I said, no, you can't go to commissary.
I said, no, but I've known this is coming.
I loaded it up on commissary.
You already ordered everything.
Are you in a two-man cell?
Cause they'll pull you out of a two-man cell
and stick you in the, in the fishbowl.
Like I'm already in the fishbowl.
And they were like-
What the fuck's the fishbowl?
Oh, it's a fucking room about half this size
with like 12 guys in it.
Damn.
To just bunk beds.
Were you really in that or no?
No, I was, cause I'd gone out of art app
so you go in there first.
So it's like I'm already in the fishbowl.
I already have commissary.
You can shut my commissary off.
There's nothing you can do.
Where do you keep your shit?
Oh, and you got a locker that's like 18 inches deep
by maybe two feet wide by three feet tall.
Okay.
That your whole life is in there.
Okay.
And then you have like a legal locker.
So I would have a legal locker.
Oh, separate locker for like,
for like transcript court shit.
Right.
It's half the size of your, of your regular locker.
So, unless you're like Racini, Racini.
Oh yeah.
Then you got a whole lot of boxes
of fucking shit there for your stuff.
Or Deverelli.
Deverelli rented people.
He had people go out and get legal lockers
and rented them.
So go there, tell them you want a legal locker.
Like he had like four or five legal lockers.
He's just paying you to rent the locker
to keep his stuff in.
And he had boxes under his bed.
Fucking Deverelli.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, yeah.
So here's what I wanted to tell you.
This is, this is, I was at the medium.
This is everybody's, this is like Triano say,
what was the fucking worst thing you've seen?
What was the worst?
I said, the worst thing I saw?
I said, well, I was at the medium.
And he goes, yeah, what was it?
I said, there were a lot of people at the medium
that had life sentences.
So you got some black guy who's six foot two,
who's got a life sentence,
worked his way down from the pen.
He works out all the time.
He looks like he's on steroids.
He's just a genetic freak.
And they're half the guys there look like that.
They're just massive.
They're hard as a rock.
And they look like tree stomp.
They're just, they're like, right.
So I'm in the library, which in the mediums,
empty all the time.
And then these guys go in the library.
So I go in there and I'd ride or whatever.
So I'm in there one day and this,
I'm gonna say punk because that's what they call them there.
You know, a gay guy or a transgender, whatever.
They call them punks?
Punks.
So there's a punk in there, probably five, 10,
you know, thin braided long hair.
Listen, looks from the outside clothes, a woman
flipping through a glamour magazine or something,
like a Cosmo or something, legs crossed.
Flipping, I mean, just ridiculous.
So, you know, I'm sitting there and you know,
he's over there and this guy walks in the library
and I'm just sitting there doing whatever I'm doing.
There's like five or six guys in the library.
It holds like 30 people.
There's like five or six of us.
And I'm sitting there and this guy walks in
that you know has never been in the library.
He walks in and you're like, holy shit, look at that guy.
He's massive.
He didn't leave the wreck yard.
So, you know, he walks in, he walks in,
he walks right up to the punk and he goes,
can I talk to you outside?
The punk just flips the magazine.
He's, the guy looks around and goes,
baby please, baby, can I please,
can I please talk to you outside, please?
And I was like, the fuck did he just say?
Baby please?
He just said, baby please.
Baby please.
And the punk goes, goes,
I don't like the way you talk to me in front of your friends.
And he goes, he looks around.
Everybody's like looking down.
He's like, you know,
with that same accent?
Oh yeah, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
I don't like the way you talk to him in front of your friends.
And I go, I trust him.
I've been mucking, I've been doing the accent,
the whole, ever since I saw it,
I've been, I've told this story, you know.
I don't like the way you-
It's straight out of that prison break fucking show.
Oh, it's fucking horrible.
So, and I just, the guy's looking around
and everybody's looking like you're staring at me.
He look over at you, you look away.
And he's like, baby, baby please,
baby please talk to me outside.
Please baby, please.
And you're like, this is the most humiliating
I've ever seen.
Oh my God.
They have a little tiff.
Finally, the punk gets up and goes to walk outside.
While they're walking outside,
he goes to put his hand on, on, on the guy's arm.
And, and he goes,
oh, like, I mean, just like a woman would do.
And he goes, oh, baby please.
It was, it was so humiliating.
Goes outside, five minutes later,
the punk comes sashaying back in, sits down.
The big guy comes back in, walks over and he's like,
baby please, please, please don't get outside.
Please don't, sorry, baby.
It was the most fucking pathetic thing
I've ever seen in my entire life.
I felt horrible for that guy.
Wow.
I mean-
He broke up with him?
He wants to talk to her for obviously sexual reasons,
right?
They're probably, he's probably what they call a war dot,
a war daddy.
He's protecting the punk.
That's his girlfriend.
He obviously said something fucked up
in front of his friends.
The punk's upset.
Bro, it's got some relationship.
Yeah.
Of course.
It's just a whole thing.
It was, I mean, I was just like, this is so bad.
It was so-
God damn, dude.
How did you get there?
I was like, I can't-
I was just on a yacht a few years ago.
Yeah.
How the fuck did I get here in the library?
It was fucked up library.
This is my life.
Oh my god.
I was on a yacht in Italy.
What the fuck, dude?
Oh my god.
It was horrible.
That's how it changes, right?
Damn, dude.
You know, the mindset-
What a crazy life.
Yeah, look, it is.
The mindset in there is so fucked up.
I mean, let me tell you, you get so desensitized.
There's so much violence and people are fighting.
And of course, I'm not involved in it,
but you see it everywhere.
Right.
Like I was in the wreckyard one day, right?
I'm standing there.
Waiting there because there's like a funnel point.
So everybody's piled up and waiting.
And there was this guy standing right here.
I think I gotta tell you this.
Guy standing right here, his head's right here.
Another guy, a Mexican guy, comes running up.
He's got a sock.
Well, not a sock.
He's got his belt wrapped around his thing
and it's through a lock.
Yeah.
Like let me put it right, right.
If I had a lock and a sock,
sorry, if I had a belt and a lock right here,
you guys are done.
Oh, it's fucking hell, yeah.
You guys could be grabbing stuff.
And there's stuff to grab here.
There's nothing there.
Nothing.
You've got nothing to grab, nowhere to go.
This guy runs up and the lock swings right by my head
and hits this guy in the skull.
The guy falls.
Boom, the guy hits him again.
Boom, he stumbles.
He hits him again, hits him again, hits him again
till he falls down.
He stumbles, he starts to try and stand up again,
hits him again.
Why are you standing up?
Anyway, you know what I'm saying?
It's just, lay down.
The guy's not hitting.
This happened.
I'm sitting there and my first thought was,
did I get fucking blood on me?
Yeah.
Not this poor guy.
I need to jump in.
You don't jump in.
You jump in.
Hell no.
You go to the fucking shoe.
Right.
You walk away.
If there's a fight, guys don't pile around and watch.
They walk, start walking.
Guards will come in and swarm around everybody
and just start grabbing.
You, you, you.
15 guys go to the shoe.
I happen to be playing guitar next to the fight.
So, this guy's bleeding so bad,
he actually tries to leave.
And one of the COC's sees how much he's bleeding
and realizes, whoa, whoa, whoa.
He had a white shirt on that was completely like dark red.
Just filthy dark red from the blood.
Your skull bleeds so much.
It's amazing how much your skull will bleed
compared to any other party body.
So, that guy, it turned out,
that guy got beat up over a punk.
So, later on, like let's say, whatever.
At another time, I'm sitting there,
and this is, like I said, this is how fucked up you are.
You would, you get, is that I remember one time
they were screaming, lockdown, lockdown.
Somebody had gotten stabbed in the yard.
There's a guy, a white guy.
There's not a lot, in the medium, like literally,
we're saying, we're talking about like 1600 guys,
there's maybe 50 white guys.
And 40 of them, 40 of them are there for meth with no teeth.
I mean, what am I gonna, who am I gonna talk to?
So, you can't link up with those guys.
I'm not talking to, I can not
that in common with these guys.
You know, they say, make statements like,
that motherfucker's a goddamn genius.
Best meth I ever had.
You're like, Christ, what am I gonna talk to this guy about?
Right, you can't link up with those guys.
Right, so, this guy comes down one day,
they're screaming, lockdown, lockdown.
He comes running up to me and he says,
bro, somebody just got stabbed.
He goes, you know what, you know,
my celly just got stabbed in the fucking wreck yard.
I go, your fucking celly did?
And he goes, that's Timmy?
And he goes, they're screaming, getting yourselves in.
We're having this conversation.
People are running around.
Timmy just got stabbed and he goes, yeah, I go.
So, you're saying there's a two-man room available?
And he goes, exactly, he's putting your fucking thing
right now.
I fill out a cop out and put it under the door
and then run back to my fucking cell
while the cops are screaming at us to get in.
Holy shit.
Timmy's done.
Free room, hell yeah.
Two-man room.
Gotta get out of this three-man room for himself.
It's fucking vicious.
Wow.
Vicious, where is this the fucking microwave one day?
We're eating something up.
And a fucking shank, this big, fell,
it was taped up under the thing and it just went,
ding, and fell.
I went, whoa, I look over at the guy I'm with
and he goes, kicks it under the door,
goes over and tells one of the Mexican guys,
he goes, fucking shank just fell.
And they're like, oh, shit.
Five of them walk over there like a wall
and one guy jumps down and grabs the shank and takes off.
I mean, just, it's just ridiculous.
And what's what, is this in the medium?
That's the medium.
The medium.
When I went to the, at 20, when I went to the low,
you know, it's a different atmosphere.
What's so funny is, like at the medium,
I never had any problems.
I had the only problem, the closest I even came
to a problem was I was slamming my door.
The doors are thick and heavy.
So I'm walking out and just, you know,
I walk out and close the door and it would,
you know, I let it go and even though it didn't slam,
because it's so heavy, it does go, you know,
it's even if it's moving slow and it hits it.
It's loud.
So my next door neighbor one day comes to me and goes,
hey Cox, and I'm like, come on, I'm gonna talk to anybody.
I have nothing to talk to you guys about.
I talked to maybe three people, the whole compound.
So the guy comes over and he goes, Cox, can I talk to you?
And I was like, yeah, do I know you?
He goes, yeah, I'm your next door neighbor.
I went, in the unit?
Yeah.
And I went, okay, man, I'm sorry, bro, I don't know.
He's been my next door neighbor for like nine months.
No idea.
So, and he goes, listen, I'm taking anger management.
And I thought, no conversation starts well.
There's no good conversation starts off taking anger management.
And I thought, okay, he goes, you've been slamming the door.
Man, I don't know if you're doing it on purpose.
And I'm bipolar and I feel like maybe you are.
I don't, he starts having a little fucking melt on me.
I said, bro, if I'm slamming the door
and it bothers you, I apologize.
That's totally my fault.
My bad.
I'm gonna take care of that.
I'm gonna slam that door no more.
That was my bad.
And I apologize for that.
I mean, this guy would kill me.
Really?
And I'm like, no.
Big ass dude?
How big do you, if you're five foot eight, you're a big guy.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm five, six.
It doesn't matter, it could, him and four of his buddies,
it's over.
Right, right, right, don't matter.
So, that was, I mean, literally he, the problem was,
I didn't stop, stop slamming the door.
I slammed it like, for the next week or,
my cell, he comes to me and goes.
On purpose?
No, I just, I'm not thinking.
You just don't give a fuck.
I'm walking out of my cell.
I'm going to work.
Slowed, right.
So, I teach GED to a bunch of retards.
Yeah.
I mean, I teach, listen, I'm teaching prison GED
and I'm teaching what's called the skills class.
These are the guys that have taken GED,
taken so many hours, they can't pass the GED.
They give them a pass if they can pass the skills class.
So, I'm teaching 40-year-old men and 30-year-old
and 20-year-old men how to count change.
Basic math.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They can't, they can't do it.
I don't understand.
You know, all the words to Tupac's and dog chain
and all these songs and you can tell me how much money
this guy made, you can tell me the stats
for all of these football teams and everything,
but you don't know that a quarter,
a dime and a nickel is 40 cents.
And they're like, I need to know all that shit.
I'm going back to sell drugs, man.
But yeah, but don't you, but you have to count your money.
My whole count my money.
My bitch count my money, yo.
And I'm like, yeah, but what if you're,
what if your bitch counts the money wrong?
I put that pipe on her, she count that shit, right?
You're like.
That pipe.
Holy shit.
Fucking whore.
Oh my God.
Keep in mind too, by this point,
I've been engrossed in this whole thing.
Right.
One of the worst moments I had was,
I talked about when I went to the low,
remember when the guy said, you know,
trying to call your peeps?
I don't know what the hell he's saying.
I'm standing behind these two black guys.
I hate to use the black guys as the examples,
you know what I'm saying?
But it's like 80% of the population.
And they're urban guys, you know?
And I am a typical, you know, white,
middle class white guy.
Right.
So, you know, and they're calling you a cracker
and all this stuff.
Yeah, yeah.
But I'm sitting behind these two black guys
and I'm sitting there and the one guy,
they're talking about their case.
And the one guy goes, man, how you fall, man?
Shit.
Nigga got nigga fucked up over two doves and a stack.
You know what I'm saying?
And I thought, I do know what he's saying.
Oh my God, I know exactly what he's saying.
You know what he's saying?
That's when you realize you're like,
I've been in here too long.
Yeah.
Think about what he said.
Two doves.
Yeah, nigga got nigga fucked up over two doves and a stack.
Thousand bucks.
Thousand bucks.
Thousand bucks.
Two doves.
Two doves.
Two doves.
Two doves and a thousand bucks.
Two doves.
Oh, birds.
Yeah, birds.
Oh.
Nice.
Yeah.
I mean, I'm like.
Or we call them chickens.
When I, listen, I went, when he said that, I was like,
oh, I've got to get out of here.
I have to get out of here.
I know exactly what you're saying.
You know what I'm saying?
I know exactly what they're saying.
I'd be great in prison.
I listen to, so we listen to like,
Gucci would not be great in prison.
I would be able to communicate very well.
I know that, I know that, I know that lingo.
I listen, I listen to a lot of fucking dolls.
They might braid Danny's hair up the first day in there.
I, you got to shave your scalp so that the wig,
so that the mop wig fits just right.
Bullshit.
I'd be fucking in with him, bro.
I'd be cool.
I wouldn't be no punk.
Listen, it's, you know, that's the whole thing,
that the whole punk thing, it's just not true.
It's like, it's not that it's not true.
It's like, look, I don't know what it is like
at other places, at Coleman, it's not true.
You know what I'm saying?
There's too many gay guys, and whatever, it's too available.
There's too many guys doing stuff.
Are there any gay prison guards?
Probably, you, well, there's lots of,
like, you know the lesbian prison guards.
You don't necessarily know the gay prison guards.
Cause you know, like, you know,
obviously in the women's prisons,
like the prison guards can get away with like,
sexual assault on the prisoners,
cause they're women or whatever.
I'm wondering if there's any like, dude prison guards.
The only thing I know of is one time,
we were, I know this guy's got 20 years,
I'm not going to use his name
cause they're still locked up, it's fucked up.
And he would be humiliated.
They don't have YouTube in there, do they?
No, but the guards do.
Oh, okay.
And Matt's PO does too.
Matt's PO does.
Like P.O. said, not only does he watch this podcast,
multiple people watch the podcast.
Hi, hi to Matt's PO.
Yeah.
Oh my god.
Oh no, he definitely doesn't want to put that in there.
I know you guys all watch the podcast.
Thank you so much.
All your friends to subscribe.
Subscribe.
Yeah, we're trying to break 300,000.
Leave a comment.
So, we had a guy one time, a CO, who's a new CO,
he just been transferred.
He calls this other guy in to the office.
He walks by, he was, hey, older guy, older white guy.
He calls this other white guy in to the inmate in
to his office.
He goes, hey, how long you been here?
He was like, been here a while, about three years,
about three years.
You know, getting called into CO's office is not good.
It's like, you know, you walk out,
I was like, what would you all talk about?
Like, are you telling on people?
Are you, why are you in, why are you, you know?
Yeah.
So, he's like, I've been here about three years.
And he goes, yeah, he said, how old are you?
He's like, about, you know, about 60.
He's like, whatever his age was.
He's like, and the CO was probably in his late,
probably early 60s.
He's like, yeah, he goes, well, you work out?
Work out?
You look at your pretty good shape.
He's like, I work out.
I work out.
He's like, yeah, I work out.
Well, he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And he said, at that point, I started going,
the fuck is going on?
He's hitting on.
This guy's fucking checking him out.
He's sizing him up, yeah.
So, he said, it got to the point
where he, they're having a conversation.
And then he said, out of the blue, the CO says,
you know, if you're in prison and you have sex
with another man, it doesn't make you gay.
And he goes, yeah, it does.
He goes, he goes, ah, it doesn't, it doesn't.
I mean, you know, you're in prison
and you know, people do things in prison.
They wouldn't normally do.
He goes, not me, not me.
He said, look, I gotta go.
And he walks off.
So, he comes and tells me and I go, holy shit.
He's like, yeah, I don't feel good about that.
You know, what the fuck?
Oh, God.
And I looked at him, I went, fuck.
So, then I'm going, I talk to my buddy Pete.
Racini?
Racini.
So, we're down there and I go, tell him what happened.
He goes, man, listen to this shit.
So, he tells us all.
It's me, Pete, and some other guy.
We're talking.
And so, Pete looks at me and it looks at me
and we're all looking at each other and I go,
honestly, that may be your get out jail free card.
Oh, fuck you.
And he goes, oh fuck.
He goes, what do you mean?
You guys are fucking evil.
He goes, what do you mean?
And I went, I'm just saying, don't be so quick
to turn this guy down.
And he goes, hey, fuck you.
I go, I'm just saying, look, what's the big deal?
I said, you give him a reach around
and Pete goes, save the sample.
And he goes, and so he's like, quit fucking around.
Quit fucking around.
Bro, you got a lot of time.
It's just not looking good.
Your case ain't going well.
You're going to do that whole fucking 20 bit.
You understand?
I said, I'm just saying, what's the big deal?
And what's he saying?
Nobody's going to say anything.
I'm not going to judge you, because I won't judge you.
He's just furious and like fucking, you fucking asshole.
If you could blow the prison guard
for save 10 years of your life, would you do it?
I'll do the time.
Would you really?
Are you fucking serious?
I don't know.
Fuck you.
I'm blowing no motherfuckers.
How the hell to the middle of it?
You know how many guys?
I might jack a dude off for 10 years.
Blowing, blow job, that's bad.
I don't know if I definitely wouldn't do that.
But to give a fucking prison guard,
to jack off a prison guard to save 10 years of your life,
you wouldn't do it?
Rather kill myself.
You wouldn't jack a dude off.
Do you know how many times in prison
you've had this conversation?
Like if I make it 50 anyway, he's bummed out.
Big fat, big fat.
Brother Jeffrey Epstein.
And the guy that's like him saying
he's about to kill himself, that's the real gay guy.
Hell.
You'd be like, this hideous-looking prison guard,
female prison guards, and guys would be like, would you?
Dave's never even started being a county, though.
Three years off your sentence.
They're like, three years off your sentence, would you?
And I'd be like, no.
No, no.
I'd go, no, no.
They'd go, what if nobody had to know?
I'd know.
Fuck, yeah.
I'm not doing it.
No fucking way.
Dude, 20, OK, 20 years.
20 years.
You would, if you could, if fucking, if God came down from
heaven, you said a shame, listen, wait, wait,
shut up, if God, shut up, hang on, no, I'm making it up.
If you're in prison and fucking God comes down from heaven,
20 years, on day one, God comes down and says,
Shane, if you jack this guy off, you're a free man.
You don't have to do 20 years.
Not a chance, bro.
No, you're doing 20 years.
You're doing 10 or 20.
You're doing 10 or jack some guy off, or you're doing 20?
No, no, you're doing 20.
Or you jack off the guard.
You walk out of the front gate.
And you walk out.
No time.
Fuck that.
No way.
You're doing 20.
No way, I'd rather do 20.
I'm saying I jack off the prison guard.
I'm walking out of the gate.
I jack off the prison guard.
Might give him a massage.
It's a lot of time, bro.
Fuck it, 20 years to jack a guy off?
I don't give a fuck.
So, all right, I can't fucking believe you're doing 20.
That went left so hard.
No way am I doing it.
No fucking way.
He's a real homophobe.
I'm not jacking some dude off.
Oh, listen, you want to listen.
At 11 o'clock at night, you know what K2 is?
Yeah.
OK.
They give me the synthetic weed.
Right, so you understand, they send it in there all the time.
Yeah.
Like, they'll.
That's just nasty.
Yeah, they'll dip like the corner of a letter in,
and somebody mails it in there.
And they know it's the number left.
They peel it off.
They fucking die off of that shit.
Oh, they get mad back just all the time.
Oh, yeah.
Guys will strip their clothes off,
think they're on fire, run around screaming,
run naked across the compound.
Holy shit.
The guards will surround them.
And they're like, and they're like, you know,
and then they'll have to jump on some naked guy.
Or guys will smoke it in the fucking bathroom
at 11 o'clock at night.
And next thing you know, they're screaming,
or they're out on the, this happens all the time.
Oh, yeah.
You go in the bathroom.
Just tell me about it.
He said he was in there.
He said there was three of them in there.
They got some K2.
He said, one guy hit it, hit it one time,
fell back on the floor, boom, passed out.
He said, the next guy grabbed the joint out of his hand
that passed out, hit it, boom, passed out.
And then the guard comes in and says,
he thinks he knocked the two guys out in a fight.
He said, what the fuck, you fighting these guys?
And then he sees the joint in one's dude hand,
and he's like, did you smoke that shit?
He's like, am I laying on the ground?
He said, hell no.
So the guys just smoked two of them.
It's like embalming fluid on it and all sorts of shit.
They just fucking almost died.
And they'll tell you, they've taken guys to the hospital.
They fucking got them on respirators.
Yeah, he said they were in there for like 20 days.
Laying in bed fucking screaming and hollering.
They're on fire.
She's nasty.
You're like, I'm trying to fucking sleep.
Dash is nasty.
And you know you got the same batch he got,
and then you go immediately go in the bathroom
and smoke your shit, because that's a good shit.
The guy's on fire, oh, that must be the shit.
You want to be on fire.
I want to be on fire.
Oh, no.
I don't want to be on fire, dawgs.
No way.
But like at 11 o'clock at night,
you go in the bathroom, right?
It's going down.
It's like Sodom and Gomorrah going down.
I mean, there'll be a couple of punks in there
with a fucking couple of guys.
It's like what?
Going down?
Sodom and Gomorrah.
What is Sodom and Gomorrah?
It's just they're having sex with each other.
What is that reference?
It's the Bible.
It's Sodom and Gomorrah.
Sodom and Gomorrah.
Yeah, it's the city of what?
So it was in the city Sodom and Gomorrah was the city.
You know what this is?
I've heard of it before.
Yeah, it was just the city was so bad.
It was just such a, it was just a home.
There's just sand everywhere.
They're saying there's homosexuality.
There's population.
There's just everything.
There's everything.
It's so bad that God fucking wipes the whole thing.
Try thinking, he wipes the whole thing off the face
of the earth.
It's just, you know, sodomy.
Right.
So it's just such a horrible city.
It just wipes it off of him, right?
And I forget who the two people are that like leave.
And the woman, they say, God says like leave and don't look back.
And the woman looks back and she turns into like a pillar of salt.
Yeah, so she turns into like salt.
Sodom and Gomorrah.
Did you read the Bible in prison?
Yeah, no.
It's not that I have a problem.
It's not that I don't believe.
I want to believe.
It's comforting.
The problem is, is I have an issue with just organized religion.
That would make me want to read it.
She's Christian and he's got, yeah, but so which Bible do you read?
Is it the Quran?
Is it the Bible?
Which Bible is it?
I would have read them all.
Stop.
I mean, I can't imagine that there's somebody saying,
oh, sorry, you're Baptist.
You're not going to heaven.
You're Catholic.
You're going to come on.
Stop, bro.
You know, I figure you're a good person.
You try to do good things.
I've already crossed that line.
It's over for me.
The reptilians run the whole world anyway.
I mean, how many people that are like hardcore Christians
or Catholics or have actually read the whole Bible, I doubt.
In prison, a ton of them.
Really?
Yeah.
In prison, they read them all the time.
Oh, I didn't tell you this.
This is funny.
So at the medium, I never have a problem.
I never have an issue with anybody, really.
I have a couple of close calls where it could have gone bad.
Nothing would have happened.
I'm good.
I was teaching the real estate class, too.
So everybody thinks they're going to get out and flip houses.
So I'm either selling certificates and people are happy.
Or I'm teaching the real estate class and everybody's like, man,
that dude's a beast.
He's fucking good at real estate.
I'm going to get out and make a bunch of money.
Hey, Cox, man, I appreciate a good class.
Guys are shaking my hand when they're leaving class.
It was bizarre.
Like, I changed their lives.
And I would get up there and I would explain how, look,
drug dealers really have a leg up on flipping houses.
Yeah.
Because they'll knock on doors.
They're hustlers.
They're hustlers.
Yeah, we talked about that.
So I'm fine.
When I go to the low, I get in there.
And I mean, I'm not there.
But I'm in there a few months.
And this black guy, six foot six black guy,
comes up to me one day.
In my cell, I'm sitting there and I'm writing.
Comes up to me and he says, hey, I go, yeah, what's up?
And he goes, this is how this is going to work, bro.
You give me $50 in commissary.
He goes, every month, you ain't going to have no problems.
And I go, yeah?
He goes, yeah.
I go, 50?
He goes, 50.
And I go, that could probably swing 50.
So he's got to be 50.
And he goes, yes, got to be 50.
I said, all right, you got a list or something?
A list of what?
A list of commissary items I have to buy.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
So he's kind of like, it's going better than he thought.
Big guy killed me.
He'd beat me like a small child if he had to.
I mean, it was just six foot six.
I've been working out 10 years probably.
I mean, they're ridiculous.
And I'm sitting down.
I'm still just like, all right.
I say, well, you going to give me a list or what?
And he goes, yeah, I'll get you a list.
He goes, you going to get it?
And I went, yeah, I'm going to get it.
I got you.
I got you.
I said, dude, do me a favor.
Write your name and reg number down, though.
What cell you're in.
And he goes, what do you need that for?
I said, well, I need to know where you're at so I can bring
this stuff and everything.
He goes, yeah.
And I said, yeah, make sure you write it all down.
He goes, yeah, all right.
Make sure your reg numbers and your real names on it, too.
And he goes, why?
He goes, what do you need that for?
I said, so when I bring it to the fucking counselor
and I give him the list that you just gave me and I tell him,
hey, what am I supposed to do with this?
I said, I want to make sure that when we call you,
we can get you right in the office
so we can talk about this.
And he goes, oh, that's how it is?
I said, that's how it fucking is.
I said, if I just did three years in the fucking medium,
I didn't have any problems.
I said, do you think I'm coming to the fucking low?
I'm going to pay you $50.
Oh, this was in the low?
This was in the low.
Oh, my god.
I'm going to get shook down.
No wonder you're so cocky.
Yeah, I go, I'm going to get shook down in the fucking low?
Yeah.
And he goes, oh, that's how it is?
I said, yeah.
I said, let me explain something.
I go, this is a fucking protective custody prison.
I said, so everybody here is a fucking snitch or a chomo.
I said, there's maybe four or five guys in each unit.
And those are the guys that went to trial
that didn't cooperate.
I said, no offense.
I said, you didn't go to trial.
I said, I'm thinking you didn't go to trial.
And if you did, then you don't want to fuck with a guy like me.
I said, because I'll fucking rat you out like that.
I said, I'm not paying you shit.
I said, are we all good here?
He goes, you're going to have problems.
I said, motherfucker, I've had problems my whole life.
My whole life's been a problem.
I said, I don't give a shit.
And I sat there and I'm being loud too, so people are looking.
So now he's looking.
And he goes, oh, all right, we'll see.
We'll see.
I said, all right.
He walks off.
What the fuck was he in there for, you think?
He was drunk.
He had a life sentence.
I find out later, he's gone back to court like six times
in the last five or six years cooperating,
not cracking people off, testifying, bam, man.
He went from life down to like 15 years or something.
He's down to like eight or 10 years.
So that guy's not fucking up at all.
No, he can't.
But he saw me and he thought soft, white, cracker.
That's right.
Easy.
Easy mark.
So here's what's funny about this.
So I'm walking by him and stuff, and I would see him.
And he would just kind of walk by me and whatever, bro.
So and I'm not fucking with a guy.
I mean, still, he'd kill me.
So I'm avoiding him.
But we're in the same unit.
So let's say his name is B. I forget what his name was though.
So one day, my celly goes to the drug program.
I'm in a two-man room, and I'm on the top bunk.
I'm supposed to move to the bottom bunk.
Well, this other guy, they called him Rambo.
He was a fat, fat Puerto Rican guy that was loud,
screamed all the time.
Yo, this Rambo.
Yeah, he had a cane.
And so he basically, you don't just move in someone's cell.
You go and you say, hey, look, man,
I know your bed's coming available.
I'd like to move in.
Because it's a dickhead move, and it could be a real problem,
especially with races and stuff, different races.
That's not really an issue at Coleman so much.
It is, but it is.
If people like to act like it is, but no,
he's probably going to do anything.
But you want to have somebody.
You don't want a tense situation.
So I come back from the wreckyard one day.
My celly had left the day before.
This guy, Rambo, is in the bottom bunk.
They're moving all the stuff in my cell.
And it's not your cell.
It is my cell, but it's not my cell.
I've been there.
It's the BOP cell.
But you follow the rules, right?
And I'm like, what the fuck?
So one of the guys started around.
He's like, hey, man, he moved in.
He doesn't even speak English.
So another guy, a poor working guy, is helping him out.
They're like, hey, man, he cocks, he's moving in.
I'm like, oh, that's bullshit.
Because another guy was supposed to move in.
And he's like, he's got a cane.
He's the bottom bunk.
And I was supposed to move the bottom bunk.
And I'm stuck on the top.
This fat fucker just fucked me over.
Why is the bottom bunk so much better?
Because you don't have to climb up on this.
I'm not 12.
I mean, it's comfortable.
You've got to go to the bathroom in the middle light.
You've got to climb down the bunk.
You've got to climb back up.
It's just a pain in the ass.
That's the main reason, though?
Oh, yeah.
So I'm just like, so I'm furious.
And they know I'm furious.
But they're like, yeah, fuck him.
What's he going to do?
And I'm like, OK, OK.
So I walk into the white TV room.
You've got the main TV room.
It's basically like the black TV room.
Then you've got the Hispanic TV room.
Because there's a little tiny room,
which is the Hispanic TV room.
And then you've got the white TV room.
It's a little tiny room, too.
And they've got the big room, which is the black room.
That's crazy that they all segregate like that.
Yeah.
And here's the funny thing.
They self-segregate.
Literally, they do it themselves.
So I go in the white TV room.
And I'm like, fuck, motherfucker, I start.
I bitch in there like, what's going on?
So this is a biker dude that's in there.
He goes, bro, I'm leaving in like a month.
His cell is a sex offender.
They call creature.
This guy never bays.
He's got like a pentagram.
He's a completely just this disgusting guy.
And they push him around.
People are vicious to him.
I mean, and he's timid and scared and everything.
So the guy's name was Danny.
Danny goes, uh, fuck.
He said, well, I'm leaving.
You can move into my place.
And I was like, man, I'm not staying.
Who's name was Danny?
Creature?
No, no.
The biker.
The biker.
OK.
He goes, Cox, you can move into my place.
I said, man, I don't want to be in that fucking cell one day.
And I was like, fuck.
I'm trying to figure out how I'm so fucking furious about this.
So I go, you know what?
I said, let's go talk to creature.
I said, maybe this creature will switch with me.
So we go over and say, hey, creature, listen,
would you mind switching cells?
I said, I have an issue with this guy.
He didn't speak English.
We've had a couple of issues before.
I'm not going to sell with him.
He's like, oh, I am really, he's got glasses.
He's like, I really want to stay here.
I like staying here.
I'm going to stay here.
I'm like, your creature is a real issue for me.
I really need you.
I said, look, I'm willing to get you.
I'll get you $20 in commissary.
I said, I'm not like these other guys, bro.
I'll pay you.
You know I'm good for it.
I'm not going to fuck you over.
And he's like, yeah, I think I'll stay.
I'll stay.
And then Danny goes, creature.
He said, you know, when up before I came here,
guys were really mean to you, right?
And he's like, yeah, yeah.
He said, but I don't really let him be mean to you now, right?
He's like, yeah.
He said, well, I can't guarantee it's not going to get really
bad for you unless you move.
And I go, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I said, creature, I don't know what he's saying.
That's not what's happening here.
And he's looking at me like, what?
I'm like, nobody's, it's totally up to you.
So he's like, he's like, I don't know.
I don't know.
I said, look, $30 in commissary.
And he goes, OK, I'll do it for $30 in commissary.
So we go and we go in, get the counselor, sign the paperwork,
do everything, swap fucking beds while this guy's asleep.
Who?
Rambo's asleep, taking a nap in the middle of the day.
We switch beds.
So we get the dolly, we switch the fucking, our lockers.
And when I go to put, creature's locker and I slam it, bam.
Then he, Rambo wakes up, what's going on?
What's going on?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
And I go, have fun with your new, you know, with your new
celly, turn around and I walk out.
What the fucking creature?
All of the poor recon guys rush into the cell and they're
like, all of a sudden I hear, he's looking around like, what's
going on there all like laughing at him?
And all of a sudden he goes, the chomo.
And they all fucking burst out laughing.
Who, creature said that?
No, the fucking, the Puerto Rican guy, the chomo.
Realizing I just stuck the chomo in him.
So he's furious that other Puerto Rican guys are like,
they're like, fuck you.
So now you're with the biker.
Oh yeah, I'm in with the biker, which was a really good guy.
And he left like a month later and I moved down to the run.
So what's so funny is that two weeks later, he goes,
two weeks later, I see the tall, the tall black guy that
tried to shake me down, walk, I'm walking.
No, not two, did I say two weeks?
Like two days later.
Two days later.
So I'm walking down the hallway.
What's time when you're in for so long?
I'm walking down the hallway and he goes, cocks, cocks.
And I look up at him, I go, I'm thinking, fuck.
I go, yeah, what's up?
And he goes, that shit you did with, he said, what creature?
And I go, yeah, he goes, there's a veteran move, bro.
Fucking veteran move.
He goes, nice.
He likes that.
Nice job.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He goes, he goes, nice.
We just like, after that, talking to me all the time.
Really?
He talks, what's going on, man?
What's up?
I'm like, what's up?
He's saying you had an angle on that move and you made it good.
Oh, that was just great.
That's hilarious, man.
He saw, it's funny because he's the guy when Trump won.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh, he's fucking.
What was it like in there with the fucking morning Trump won?
Because up until then, it was, you know,
these guys, they're delusional.
They think, are they else talking about like the whole,
the whole fucking presidential race?
Of course, they're all watching on TV, right?
Huge into politics.
Yeah.
And it's basically split like,
just like you'd think it would be split.
Yeah.
The Mexicans and the blacks.
Love Hillary Clinton.
All the white guys.
All the white guys love Trump, right?
You know, and I'm sitting there going,
he's never going to win.
He's not going to win.
And you got the, oh, you'll see, you'll see.
I'm like, you're fucking crazy.
That's insane.
What did you think?
I didn't think he's going to win.
There's no way he's going to win.
Did you like him?
You know, here's the problem with Trump is,
I have no problem with Trump's policies.
I don't have an issue with his policies at all.
What I have an issue is that it's like, stop talking.
Yeah.
Stop saying stupid shit.
Yeah, yeah.
Stop saying fucked up shit.
All you've got to do is read the speech.
Right.
You could go down as an amazing president.
You enter into the White House
when the economy is on enough swing.
It looks like you've done amazing things.
You can't fuck this up
unless you keep saying stupid shit.
Read the, just, read the speech.
You can't even read.
All you have to do is read.
You can't even read.
Yeah, but read the speeches.
Just read the speeches.
Make it a short, very simple speech.
Don't say anything, don't deviate.
This moment, soft-tweet it.
Yeah, he can't not deviate.
And yeah, because it's narcissism.
Yeah, of course.
And he's got this huge following of people.
Fucking massive ego.
No matter what he says.
Yeah, it's the ego.
So he's insane.
And so all the black guys are all there.
They love Hillary Clinton.
Like, she's gonna set him free.
She's gonna set him free.
Wow.
Because she was the opposite of Trump, right?
Right, it doesn't matter.
Yeah, so, you know.
It was just Trump or Hillary.
It's just, it's like me, yeah.
Obama didn't do all these things
that you guys thought they were gonna do.
Hillary's not.
Her husband built more prisons than anybody.
Right.
They're profited off of him.
Tons of prisons.
Yeah.
So I'm like, at least Trump is,
it's money about, for Trump, it's about money.
If it doesn't make economic sense,
he's gonna make a decision.
You know, it's based on-
Right, and he's all about the money.
Yeah, it's it, yeah.
So I'm like, you might have a shot of getting something.
Listen, I actually got time knocked off my sentence
because of one of the bills that he passed.
It wasn't a lot of time.
It was like 11 days.
It was supposed to be like 60 or 70 days.
I forget the exact number.
But I had already, by the time it passed,
I'd already been past that point,
so they just let me out a week early.
But one of the guys that got years off.
From Trump?
Yeah, Pete got like a year off his sentence.
Really?
He's done so much of that.
What was the bill?
The bill was that the BOP, technically,
you get 15% off your sentence for gain time, right?
But the BOP calculate, it should be 54 days a year.
But the BOP has a way of calculating
so that it's only 47 days.
So you end up losing a week of good time every year.
20 years.
So what's, Pete's got 20 years,
or he's got, what is it, 20 times, you know, seven.
So it's not, he's got six months,
six months of his sentence was knocked off, not a year.
Right, can't be down.
So actually he's more than, he's got 23 years.
So whatever that comes, basically it's six months.
He's got six months knocked off.
So I don't have an issue with his policies.
I just think he's just a blow, you know,
he's just an ass.
He's an ass, you know, it's too bad, but.
Yeah, he's wild to tell.
But what's so funny about it is that it was all energy.
Everybody was, they were all pumped up.
You got everybody fired up.
They were, no, I'm saying before the thing,
before the thing.
Oh, before you got elected.
During the election.
During the election.
During the election.
Then the next morning, it looks like he's doing well.
And I go to bed, and he's doing well.
It's not gonna happen.
I go to bed, I wake up the next morning,
I'm walking, I'm going to get my coffee,
I'm walking through the hallway,
and everybody's so quiet.
Yeah.
You hear shit.
You know, a bunch of guys up too, and they're just like,
grumbling, I'm like, what?
I see this fucking guy go, hey, hey, man.
Yeah, what's up, Cox?
And I go, man, who won the, who won?
And he goes, man, fuck you.
You know that cracker won that shit, man.
And I go, it's for laughing.
I go, are you serious?
And he goes, man, you fucking, I said, oh my God, he won.
I said, oh, I said, oh, you're done, bro.
You guys are all, you fuck you, Cox.
Because they're all telling us to make a joke.
So what's so funny is like, after that,
this is like, remember this guy was standing up?
Yeah, yeah.
So one day I come walking up.
This is like fucking four, five months later.
I go walking up to get some water,
and the guy's bent over drinking water out of the water fountain.
And I come walking up behind him, he goes, hey, hey, hey, Cox.
He goes, I don't like a white man coming up on me
like that from behind when I'm drinking water.
Joking around, right?
And I looked at him, I said, listen, bro,
I said, don't worry, another year at Trump,
you're going to have your own water fountain.
Oh my God.
He goes, oh, you should have seen him.
He was like, oh my God.
I was like, nice, right?
Oh my God, motherfucker.
He just walked off like, fuck.
Oh my God.
I mean, I would think Trump will get reelected.
Nowadays, you'll get fucking kicked off
every social media platform for saying some shit like that.
Oh my, who knows?
It's insane.
I'm just shocked.
I'm shocked that he's made it this long,
saying the stuff that he said, the things that he said.
Do you keep up with it?
Do you keep up with it?
I barely keep up with it.
When I was in prison, everybody is reading every single thing.
Right, you have all the time in the world.
So you don't even have to read anything.
Everybody will tell you what's going on.
This is what happened, and this, and this, and this.
What's amazing to me was the guys that were actually
predicting that he was going to win, and then he won.
And they were just like.
Were they betting on it in there?
Oh, they bet on it.
Hell yeah, they bet on everything.
The only time I ever bet was on the Casey Anthony trial.
Did she get convicted?
No, I bet, because the odds were really,
I bet that she would get, the highest odds
was that she would get, she would get a.
Let go.
Yeah, let go.
You could bet, you know, guys were taking soup,
so I bet one soup, I said, boom, she's getting off.
And they were like, you're fucking crazy.
I said, all right, we'll see.
That crazy ass bitch got off.
I said, I saw that opening scene,
and I saw the opening argument,
or whatever you call it, when they first start,
and that guy said, when the lawyer, Jose.
Jose Baez.
Baez said, she could be,
she could be having her father's penis in her mouth
at seven o'clock, and by eight 30,
she was playing with her friends in the playground
at school, I thought.
That was her lawyer, right?
It was her lawyer, said that.
You have to understand where her mind's at,
she's being molested or whatever.
And when he said that, I was like, holy,
I couldn't believe he said it.
I was just blatant like that.
I was like, oh, this dude's gonna pull something off.
Anybody who's, he's willing to go.
He said, yeah, he stretched it to the farthest.
He's gonna blame everything on the father,
holy shit, and then she gets off.
I was like, holy shit.
That's funny.
But she did it, right?
Everybody knows she did that shit.
She did, I'm sure she did.
God damn.
Right, sometimes you get that fucking lawyer
that pushes, like, who's OJ's lawyer?
Johnny Cochran.
Johnny Cochran, you get that Johnny Cochran
in there once in a while, man, you get lucky.
Yeah, I think I won like 10 or 11 soups.
On that bet?
Wow.
Really high, I was like, well, I mean, it's all soup.
Fuck it, I'm, you know.
Soups, but it's soups a lot in there.
Soups of soup.
Yeah, anything, anything free.
I'd go for a soup right now.
Soup sandwich?
You know, everybody complains about those,
those ramen soups.
Those ramen soups.
They're awesome.
Yeah, they're fire.
Love ramen soup.
So like there's all these guys that are locked up, right?
That, you know, look, first of all,
you're in a prison where almost everybody cooperated
or they cooperated or they're sex offenders, right?
But you got these guys that will show up
and of course they're like, you know,
I ain't fucking cooperating against nobody, you know.
They're walking around calling everybody a fucking snitches
and fucking chomobos.
Because they're gonna trial.
Huh?
No, they didn't even go to trial.
So you didn't go to trial, you ended up here,
you didn't go to trial, but you didn't cooperate.
Well, that doesn't really make sense.
The statistically it doesn't make sense.
I mean, maybe there's one or two of those guys,
but the fact that you're also a six foot tall white guy
that's a tatted up and you got 15 years
and you didn't go to trial, but you got,
it just doesn't make sense.
You know what I'm saying?
Why wouldn't they have sent you some place
closer to your house?
There's all these prisons that are closer to your house.
Why would they send you across the country?
They sent you across the country
from fucking California here.
You cooperated.
You can't go to a California prison.
You know, there's guys that you cooperated.
It'll get around.
You don't have the correct paperwork.
So they send you to a prison
where you can't get your paperwork in.
Everybody at Coleman will say,
oh yeah, I can't get my PSI.
Your PSI basically tells whether you cooperated.
Yeah.
So they're like, yeah, when you get there,
if it's a real, like a tough prison, they go,
man, listen, you've got about two weeks
to get your paperwork in.
And then everybody kind of is standoffish.
They don't, they're not judging you yet.
Right.
Wait for your paperwork to come in.
And I've changed people's paperwork.
Like, I mean, when I was at the,
I had access to a computer and a printer.
When I was at the medium,
and I had guys that would come to me
and be like, listen, man, you know,
this guy, he's such and such, he's a good guy.
His fucking paperwork's fucked up though.
His PSI, I mean, I know you fucking do documents
and shit out.
Is there any way?
You got a fine arts degree.
Yeah, you got a fine arts degree.
They all know that.
Yeah, and I go, I go, give me his fucking PSI.
And we looked through, he goes,
it's this page right here, and then the last page.
I go, all right.
So I'd match up the font, I'd retype the thing,
I'd paste it on, I'd paste it over it.
I'd go make a fucking copy of it.
I'd copy all the pages so they all look the same.
And we had changed the last page,
whole thing, give it back to him, boom.
Here's what's fucked up.
I did that maybe three or four times in the medium for guys.
I had this one guy that was a Mexican.
He was a half Mexican, half Puerto Rican.
And the Mexicans were giving him a hard time.
Cause they don't like the Puerto Ricans.
They're already pit, they already don't like them.
So, and he can't provide his paperwork.
So when I give him the paperwork, I say,
look, wait till they ask you again.
Tell them you got it in a couple of days ago.
Tell them you're gonna show one or two of the shot callers
and you don't wanna hear about it again.
I said, you see what I'm saying?
Don't be passing around, don't be stupid about it.
Like you're flaunting it.
People will get suspicious if you're flaunting it.
You don't wanna show it,
cause you don't, there's a lot of snitches here.
You know what I'm saying?
I said, be reasonable, just like the other guys would be.
They don't wanna show everybody their paperwork.
Somebody will jump on their case.
Right.
And he goes, okay, okay, okay.
So a couple of days later,
guys are like, man, you ever get your paperwork in?
He's like, yeah, man, I got it.
I'm gonna show it to you, but I'm gonna show it to everybody.
But I'll show it to you, to this shot caller
and this guy and the guy who's running this unit.
And that's it, man.
Y'all vouch for me.
That's it.
I ain't showing it to fucking 50 people.
They go in, they look at it, they check it out.
He's good.
That's it.
Man, a month later, I walk in
and he's standing there with a bunch of the Mexicans
that were basically shunning him before.
And as I walk by, I hear him say,
man, we're gonna have to see
that motherfucker's paperwork, man.
I think it's-
About you?
No, about somebody else.
About somebody else, yeah, yeah.
He's like, yeah, some new guy, he's like,
yeah, I wanna see his paperwork.
I don't think he's no good.
I don't think he's no good.
I look over at him and he looks at me and he's like,
looks at the ground like, fuck.
And I'm just thinking, you fucking piece of shit.
What?
So now your paperwork's no good
and I just got you good paperwork.
Now you're going around asking for people's paperwork.
It's just a fucking hypocrite piece of shit.
He was a scared kid that I thought I was helping out.
Now you're just a scumbag.
I figured, I'm gonna do it because I feel bad for him
and I figure the next guy maybe he helps out
and he didn't fucking help him out.
He's ready to jump right in the fucking car
with everybody else.
People are fucking savages too, right?
I mean, you don't have to be,
he was an advocate for the paperwork.
But what's so funny is you get to the low,
it's the same thing.
There's still last people are asking for paperwork,
but it's hard to get your paperwork sent in.
Like guys will say, I tried to get it sent in,
it came through legal, they turned it down and it is,
it's difficult.
I've had my PSI sent, my PSI was sent in twice.
My PSI looks good.
Like it doesn't say anything about cooperation or anything.
It's actually, it's amazing how good it looks.
And I would get it and guys would come to me and go,
yo, Cox, man, you just got here and we heard some shit
and I'm gonna need to see your paperwork.
I'm like, oh, okay, I'll show you my PSI.
And I go, here, come here.
And I show it and they look through it and I go, okay.
You had no one to cooperate against?
Huh?
You had no one to cooperate against?
No, I cooperated against everybody.
For some reason it wasn't in my PSI.
Because the last pages what they're mostly concerned about
and it says like, did he get a 5K one
or is he got a rule 35 coming?
I don't have anything like that.
So it looks good to them.
They're not gonna read fucking 50 pages of documents.
So they're like, he's like, all right, all right,
I go, see, yeah, it says, yeah, it says I didn't cooperate.
I said, but let me go ahead and let you in on something, bro.
I cooperated against every motherfucker I could think of.
It's just not, it doesn't happen to be in here.
Doesn't mean that I didn't do it.
Doesn't mean that I don't want out of this fucking place.
I said, and it doesn't mean that I said,
any of this means shit.
Right.
I said, so I don't want to let you in on something.
I said, my paperwork looks good, but I said, I'm not good.
And he was like, the fuck.
Nobody ever says that, right?
No.
And by that point, I already know there have been articles
that say I was cooperating, that when I was in the medium,
so all he's gotta do is ask somebody.
It's already getting around.
So for me to sit there and say, you know,
for me to sit there and go, yeah, man, yeah, I'm good,
I'm good, he's gonna get an article in any day now.
So I'm like, so it's all bad.
I said, you can have people look on the internet.
It's all bad.
And he's like, that's fucked up.
I said, it is fucked up.
So we're not gonna be friends.
And I feel bad about that because he seemed like a nice guy.
And I get up and walk away and they're like,
motherfucker, what are you gonna do?
Yeah, what can you do?
Fuck you, you know what I'm saying?
I'm, give a shit.
I didn't come here to make friends.
Right, exactly.
So you're trying to get the fuck out of there.
Right, I want fucking out.
Right.
2030.
Right, I'm not here to fucking.
I'm supposed to be in prison right now.
Right.
So here's what's funny.
So some of these guys are, you know,
this like, statistically, it doesn't make sense, Danny,
that you're here on a meth case and you got 15 years.
When you've been in prison four times
and you keep telling everybody that you were caught
with this much meth and the people who operated against you,
you should have a life sentence.
Maybe 30 years.
So you're snitching.
But you got 15.
And you got a good story.
Nobody wants to question it because you're a tough guy.
You're six foot tall.
You work out all the time.
You're covered in tats.
You've been to state prison twice.
You've been to this one guy I know.
Should I say his name?
Anyway.
What could leave that blank here?
Ellis Cook.
Anyway, what a fucking dick.
Ding dong.
So he fucking, you know, he walks around
like he's a badass, right?
He's a badass.
Beat me to a fucking pulp.
But then you don't have to be that bad of a guy.
A bad of a badass.
He did or he could.
No, he could.
I mean, he's been to state prison multiple times.
Motherfuckers, you know, he's like fucking probably close.
He's like 5'10, 5'11, I say six foot.
He's probably 5'10, 5'11.
But works out all the time.
White guy, meth dealer.
So, and he's been to state prison multiple times.
So what I'm saying is he and I constantly
went back and forth, bickering, fighting, this and that,
you know, talking shit to each other.
In the low.
In the low.
And so in the white TV room, you know,
like he wants to watch this program.
You know, all he wants to do is watch fucking fishing
and that gold rush and just all fucking just horrible
program, you know, and like state troopers, Alaska.
It's like, ah, stop it.
It's like hillbilly.
I can't watch all this fucking fishing shit.
You're not even allowed to have a gun.
Why are you watching this show about guns?
You can't have a gun.
I want one.
I can't have that.
So I used to watch Walking Dead all the time, right?
Did you really?
The only thing I ever watched.
Show so bad.
I love that show.
So corny.
So loves that show.
Loves that show.
That's like me saying that football's stupid.
I don't like football, but I have to admit, clearly,
there's some.
I couldn't take the fucking show seriously.
It's just too fucking corny.
Can't take it seriously.
The fucking Rick Carl.
Oh, Carl.
The fucking Walker.
They were so, it was so cheesy.
Dude, it was so fucking lame.
Anyways, we'll get past it.
We can get past our differences there.
You know, it comes on like every three months,
and then every three months, every three months.
So here's guy comes in, and we watched three months.
And then three months later, we watched it again.
Three months later, we watched it again.
So well, the next time it comes on,
there's something called Broken Skull Ranch.
It's going to be on basically about the same time.
And so Walking Dead's coming up, and they're making a schedule.
Like, oh, Walking Dead's on Sunday.
And Cook goes, bro, we ain't watching that shit.
We're watching Broken Skull Ranch.
And I go, that's what's Stone Cold, right?
Yeah.
Is that really?
That's Stone Cold show?
Yeah.
I love how you know that.
And I go, it's Stone Cold's shit.
Stone Cold rules, but I ain't watching
fucking Broken Skull Ranch till I've seen it.
So I go, no, we're not watching that.
And he goes, yeah, we are.
And I go, no, we're not.
And he goes, yeah, we are, bro.
And I go, no, we're not because I've been here fucking seven
goddamn five fucking years, and you're just got here.
And we've been watching this for five years.
I said, we're going to keep watching it.
And he goes, yeah, we'll fucking see, bro.
We'll see on Sunday when that shit ain't on.
I go, OK, we'll fucking see.
I said, we'll be here with your fucking boots on, motherfucker.
He goes, I'll beat your ass.
I said, maybe you'll beat my ass.
Maybe it don't go your way.
And he said, fuck you, I'll fuck you.
I get up and walk out.
He's going to kill me.
So what happens?
You're just hoping you scared him.
Oh, this goes back and forth.
There's always the fear of, it doesn't matter
whether it's a fight or not, we're both going to shoe.
You know what I'm saying?
Right, we both lose.
Yeah, we're both losing.
So next day, we have another bickering argument.
Next day, it's all day.
Sunday comes.
It's on Sunday night.
It's all day long.
It's D-Day.
I got my fucking boots on.
Like, I'm really like, I'm ready to fucking go.
I'm actually not going to go.
I mean, like, if he stood up and said, I just fucking
storm off, I'm not going to get into the fight or anything.
But I can't let him know that.
I'll play it up.
I'll play it right up to the fucking hill.
Right up to the fucking last second.
I'll stand up and be like, motherfucker, what the fuck?
I'm just talking, bro, you can turn.
You know, I don't care if I walk off.
I don't just fucking with you.
So we're going back and forth back.
And guys are like, bro, he ain't fucking around.
He's telling everybody.
And I'm telling all these guys that watch Walking Dead,
we're all going in there.
They're like, so you're telling me that all 15 of us
go in there, you're going to turn the channel.
You're fucking goddamn right I am.
They're like, goddamn, Cox, you're serious.
I'll go, bring your fucking boots, bro.
I'm not doing nothing.
But so he comes to me one day, so one day,
so like an hour before Walking Dead, we're in there.
Watch it, you know, just watching TV.
We're sitting there and waiting and waiting.
He's in there too?
Oh, we're both in there.
Oh, you're both in there.
It's an hour away, though.
I'll post it up all day.
Shit talking, nothing going back and forth?
Nothing really at that moment.
And he says, oh, by the way, and I
go to get up to go get some food.
I start bringing my food and shit.
Popcorn?
Popcorn, of course.
So I go to get my stuff.
And he gets up too.
And we're both getting up and he goes,
oh, I see you.
He makes it make a comment.
I see you got your boots on.
I'm like, don't even fucking worry about my boots, bro.
Don't even fucking worry about my shit.
Keep my name at your mouth.
That's what you do.
Doing all this stupid shit that people do.
So he goes, I go to get up and he said, oh,
I heard about you getting your little gang together all
going to come in here.
So I'll slap the fucking shit out of every motherfucker
that walks in there.
I said, yeah, all right.
So we go to, we're all, so he gets up.
We're both walking out.
And as we walk out, he says to me, oh, you think you're
fucking, jeez, you think I'm fucking around?
And I go, listen, listen.
I go, honestly, I said, you need to stop fucking worrying.
I understand.
I said, stop worrying about the TV and walking dead.
I said, because you know what's going to happen?
No matter what happens, I'm yanking the fucking TV off
the wall and we're both going to the shoe and we're both
going to watch it together in the fucking shoe.
Do you understand?
And I said, that's how fucking serious I am.
I said, you need to stop worrying and just stop worrying
about the shit.
Here's what you need to worry about, Cook.
Start worrying about where they're going to send you,
because you better hope, because they're going to send
them to another prison.
We're both going to different prisons.
You better fucking hope they don't send you out west,
where they're asking for paperwork that we both know
you can't provide.
And he goes, somebody say something?
And I go, yeah, he goes, who?
And I go, you did just now.
And he goes, and he goes.
I said, you should have a 25-year minimum mandatory.
You got less than 15.
Oh, you do that.
And he looked at me, and he goes, man, you know,
I'm just fucking around about that shit.
You can watch that shit, bro.
I mean, I'm good with you.
You know, I'm just playing, man.
I'm just playing.
I said, I know you're playing.
I was playing too, man.
I'm just so good.
We're good.
We're good.
He goes, yeah, we're good.
We're good.
He said, we're good, though?
I go, yeah, we're good.
And he goes, OK.
He fucking goes in, gets his chair, brings his chair out,
fucking everything.
We go in, we watch Walk-In-Dead.
It was like, I can't believe you fucking.
And I'm like, holy shit.
Totally fucking bluffed his ass.
I mean, he would have beaten me to a pulp.
Oh my god.
I mean, I always felt like something was wrong.
He always said 15 years.
But it's like, it just doesn't make sense.
The amount of fucking, the amount of meth you got called with,
you've been in prison too.
You're not getting 15 years.
You got caught with a gun and meth,
and you've been in a state prison twice.
You probably should have deserved life.
Maybe 25 or 30.
Maybe 30.
I'm going to give you 25.
Not 15.
No way you got 15.
Later, he comes back and he talks to me.
He's like, look, you know, the way I got the 15
was not what you think.
So I don't care about this thing.
He tried to explain his way out.
He tried to tell me, like, he, like, buried some guns.
They always use that.
Like, I knew someday I'd get caught,
so I buried some guns.
So then I gave up.
Then I gave up.
I said, look, I know where there's a bunch of guns,
and I gave him these guns.
I didn't give nobody up.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Stop.
You didn't do that.
That's not what happened.
No stone cold today, brother.
You can watch Monday Night Raw, bitch.
I don't know.
You'll be lucky to get Monday Night Raw tomorrow.
I mean, we were best buddies after that.
Really?
He was always looking out for me.
Hey, buddy.
He wouldn't use to build the beans after that as well.
What are you doing?
God damn, dude.
But yeah, that was a.
What a fucking great story that is.
I always thought that was funny.
Holy shit.
I always thought that was funny.
I was thinking about, there was another thing that was.
What a fucking crazy story.
A fucking Ellis Cook.
There's another thing that's.
Ellis.
Ellis.
He's still in there, obviously.
Yeah.
Bro, he's, he got chipped, came back.
I mean, he's always in trouble, always in trouble.
He was trying to get it so that none of the sex offenders
could go in the TV room.
I mean, he got in trouble and they finally shipped him.
I mean, because it's just, he's just a fucking mania.
He's trying to be, he's trying so hard to play a thug
in an area or in a prison, you don't need to play a thug.
You need to kick back and just relax.
Stop asking for people's paperwork.
It's not that important.
And even if you guys all group together,
there's maybe 30 of you on the compound that didn't cooperate.
What are you going to do?
You'd get slaughtered if everybody decided to do something
for real and have a riot.
So what are you, you're clicking up with all the solid guys,
cut the shit.
Solid guys are all wish they had cooperated at this point.
They all got 25 years and they're like, I made a mistake.
So the other thing that I think that I always think is funny,
the problem is a lot of this shit is funny,
probably isn't funny because out here,
things are so vastly different and your mindset's different.
But what is funny, this might be funny,
is that after Trump won, right, outside my cell one day,
there were a bunch of a group of Puerto Rican guys
at 11 o'clock at night talking.
They're always yelling and screaming in Spanish.
It's just like, it's rude.
And what are you going to say?
You can't say anything and then they say something back
next thing you know, you're fucking screaming
and there's 150 guys trying to sleep.
People are screaming at you.
What are you going to do?
You're not going to get into a fight with fucking six Puerto
Ricans, gang members sitting outside your unit.
So you just sit there and you lay there and you just take it.
And remember one night I was sitting there,
I was like, I wish these motherfuckers
would all just go back to the island.
Wish I could just send them all back to the island.
I went, I can't send them back to the island.
But I could, Trump could send them back to the island.
Oh my god.
I went, what could I do?
I went, oh shit.
So we used to get a newsletter.
You can sign up to get a newsletter on the CoreLink
system, the email system.
And like this lawyers or different people like FedCure
and so they have these different programs, not
programming, but these different organizations.
One of the organizations is a guy named Jeremy Gordon.
And he's a lawyer.
And every two weeks or something he sends a newsletter.
In his newsletter, he always has like little articles
that he's found about some prison doing this
or some prison doing that.
So he sends these things with little tiny things
about prison reform and just stupid shit.
Newsletters.
Newsletters and how this guy got relief.
And he's doing this.
And he just found out this little article was in the New
York Times and whatever and people get him, they print it
out and they walk around, they read them and stuff.
Hey, did you hear that they're putting a bill into Congress
to try and do this and try and so and so sponsoring it
and whatever.
So periodically it comes out.
Not everybody gets it.
Not everybody subscribes to it.
So I go and I go to the library and I write an article.
But you know what Jeff Sessions is, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's basically like Jeff Sessions.
He was like the attorney general at the time.
So Trump had made him attorney general.
Really old guy, right?
Yeah.
He was attorney general and Trump was signing
like these executive orders left and right.
And everybody's freaking out, which all the presidents do
when they get in, they start just cutting stuff.
They always have a slew of them initially.
So I go and I write an article that Trump,
that because Puerto Rico was so far in debt,
Trump was, it was big in the news at that moment.
I write this article with quotes from Jeff Sessions in it,
quotes from Trump, talking about how Puerto Rico is super
in debt, and that basically Trump signed into law.
He repealed or he altered a portion of the 1917 law
that made or rule or act that made Puerto Rico a territory.
Farer than the US.
Literally, I had to read up on it.
Like I went and I looked in the insight,
you know what our internet is?
It's the Britannica.
So I would break open the Britannica
and I read all about how the United States conscripted
a bunch of Puerto Rican citizens into the military.
And the deal was we're going to make you a territory
and we're going to conscript like 50,000 Puerto Ricans
into the US military because we were sending troops
in World War I, we were sending troops over
to help fight the war.
A bunch of them were Puerto Ricans.
We didn't have enough troops.
Well, we can go to Puerto Rico, we'll just make you a territory
and our deal is we make you a territory,
but you knew 50,000 troops and they said, OK, we'll do it.
So I say in the whole article that I wrote that part of it
was that you were citizens.
However, the Constitution says that you
can alter citizenship if they have felonies, convictions.
Right.
Right?
Well, anyone with a felony, Trump
was going to have sent back to Puerto Rico.
The moment they were rounding them all up,
if you have a felony, they're rounding you up and sending you.
And every inmate currently in federal prison,
as soon as you leave, you would be sent back to Puerto Rico.
So I take that, I paste it into a Jeremy McGuire, a Jeremy Gordon
letter, or the newsletter.
The newsletter, right, right, right.
I change the date, I change the name of the inmate
that it was sent to because everything you print out
has the name of an inmate.
I change all of it.
I go and I make like 20 copies.
And it's not just, the article is like a page and a half.
Then there's other stuff before it now.
I embed the whole thing.
It's a normal one.
So I get it, I print it out, and I print a bunch of them out,
and I go and I pass out a few of them.
And I put one on the bulletin board.
And I kick back, and oh, and then I walk around
with like a copy, and I go to a couple of Puerto Rican guys,
and I go, did you guys see this?
Can they do this?
What do you mean, what does I go?
I don't know, bro, there's something about Puerto Rico?
I don't read that, but what does it say?
The guy goes, hold on, Cox, let me read it.
He starts reading it, and he's like.
He loses it.
They can't do this, man, they can't do this.
That's bullshit.
They can't, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, they get nuts.
He was, can I have this?
I'm like, yeah, I'll print out another one, it's cool.
He takes it, he goes and copies it.
Next thing you know, listen, the next day,
when I come back from the library,
there's like 10 of them in a fucking huddle,
passing out reading.
The guy's fucking reading it, and they are just
flipping the fuck out.
I got a friend name, a generic name you'll ever,
Juan Sanchez.
Is that the most generic fucking Spanish name?
That's the most generic fucking Puerto Rican name ever.
No, he's actually from Honduras or something,
but yeah, a Spanish name, yeah, Juan Sanchez.
So Juan comes to me one day and he goes,
hey, Cox, do you hear about this fucking thing,
this letter, or this article that was in the New York Times,
I go, no, what was it?
He starts telling me about it, and I go,
and I start kind of laughing, he goes,
oh man, people are freaking the fuck out.
And I start laughing, I'm like, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
And he goes, what's so funny?
I go, oh God, I said,
because I get into a lot of trouble, thinking about it.
The CO saw that, and they'd be fucking furious,
they'd throw me, they'd be like, shit me, who knows.
But I'm having such a good time listening to people flip out,
all the Puerto Ricans are in a fucking frenzy.
So he's telling me how they're going nuts.
He's like, I don't think they can do that,
man, these guys are flipping out.
The Puerto Ricans are all going to their case managers
and shit, they're going,
oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
talking in the, you know, I'm being released,
where am I gonna get released?
I'm supposed to go to Halfway House, what's going on?
And then freaking out, they're all the fucking,
counselors are looking shit up,
the whole prison's going nuts.
I start laughing, I'm gonna tell you something, bro,
but I swear to God, I said, you cannot tell,
don't tell your friend, because he'll tell somebody,
and they'll, no, no, no, no, no, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
And I tell him what happens, he goes, he's like,
you're telling me you made it up?
I tell him I made it up, and he goes,
that's fucking brilliant, that's brilliant.
He goes, how many more copies can you make?
I mean, you understand, if you went to the copy machine
for the next fucking five, six days,
they were, the Puerto Ricans were there,
making five copies, 10 copies,
they had a guy go in the unicorn,
make fucking 100 copies, and they were everywhere.
I'm standing in line in the chow hall, every line,
listening to the white guys talk about,
fuck them, I hope they all fucking go back.
Oh my God.
The fucking Puerto Ricans are all screaming at how,
they just were in an absolute frenzy.
Fake news.
It was hilarious.
Guys, and Juan had, he said, here's what's really funny,
and I go, what, he goes, do you want it,
what's really fucked up?
He said, that's the real fake news.
He goes, I've had 40 Puerto Rican guys pull me aside
and say, listen to me, I cooperated,
I can't go back to Puerto Rico, they'll kill me,
and Juan goes, he goes, you could file for,
you could file for, what do they call it,
when you, it's not extra, it's a,
when you're like a, you're like a communist,
and you come to the United States,
and you file for.
Asylum.
Asylum.
He goes, I can't believe I couldn't remember,
he goes, you could file for asylum,
and he goes, I'm telling people they can file for asylum,
and I'll, we're like laughing, I go,
you need to be charging for that shit.
Tell them you called your lawyer,
your lawyer will charge 1500 bucks,
but you can get the paperwork and do it
for a hundred bucks in commentary.
He goes, man, he said, I couldn't fit all the commissary
in my locker if I started.
Oh my God.
Took about a week, week and a half before
they'd all call their families so much,
and their families had all searched the internet,
and it finally filtered in that, look, something's wrong.
We can't find this on the internet, it's not true.
And they don't figure it out, it's you?
No, no, nobody ever figured out it was me.
Oh, I didn't say anything, I was really nervous,
Pete found out, I told Pete eventually,
because Pete comes to me and Pete's like, man,
these guys are going fucking nuts, bro.
Have you heard about this?
He goes, I keep telling them, it's not,
it would take a decade to get that through,
I don't think it would ever go through.
So he's like looking at it from a legal standpoint.
He's like, I can't, he's probably gonna go in front
of the Supreme Court, there's no way
the Supreme Court's going to allow,
and I'm sitting there going, I'm like,
I'm like, Pete, listen, I gotta tell you something.
He goes, I tell him, he goes, that's not funny,
these guys are flipping out.
Are they losing it?
Yeah, you understand, he said,
they're all concerned because they cooperated,
and I go, oh, I know.
Like, I'm sorry, I was having a bad night.
Yeah, I did, I told him, that's gonna help it,
Pete, there was like fucking 10 of them,
and there were five guys, or six guys,
or 10 guys in front of my unit, I'm so upset.
And he's like, what are you doing?
This is foolishness, you're causing panic.
You're gonna go to the shoe, you're gonna get shipped.
And I'm like, no, I'm not, it's like you
and Sanchez knows, that's it, he's like, Jesus Christ,
what are you doing?
That's hilarious, dude.
Lucky Sanchez didn't say nothing.
No, he's got, he ended up getting shipped.
He has, he has, that's like another,
you know what I told you, I've got all these little stories
that are out there?
Yeah.
He should be getting out of prison soon here.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, he's got an amazing story.
He's laundering money for the Venezuelan government
who's doing drugs, I mean, they're laundering drug money.
He's laundering drug money for them, he gets caught.
Actually, at one point, he lost a bunch of their money.
So he loses like half a million dollars
or a million, something ridiculous.
He flies over there to meet with them.
These are people in the government to meet with them,
to explain to them, listen to me, I'm sorry,
here's what happened, I fucked up, I lost the money.
Like he's investing it in something and he lost it
and I'm sorry, what can we do to get the money back?
So he's trying to talk to them.
They basically kidnap him, they keep him
in like a motel room for like a week.
He sneaks out, gets to the airport
and flies back to the United States.
The story is, when he tells it, it's riveting
because literally he gets to, like the guy's holding him,
they bring a couple of prostitutes in
and so they're all having sex with the prostitutes.
They get drunk and fall asleep.
He gets on one of the guy's computers,
sends an email to his girlfriend,
tells his girlfriend, I am going to the airport.
You have to have me on the next flight.
You have to pay for the flight and get me out.
He said, you've got to pay for, when I get there,
it has to be paid for, I have no money.
You have to pay for it.
He goes, it's like fucking one o'clock
or something in the morning.
He goes, and I'm literally telling him,
I'm gonna try and sneak out,
you have to have a ticket waiting for me.
He goes, I don't get a response,
I don't have a chance to get a response email.
You just go.
He goes, I sneak out, I get into a fucking cab, I go.
He said, when he's leaving,
one of the prostitutes laying on the bed,
she watches him creeping out.
He goes to close the door and he sees her
and she's staring right at him and she goes, go, go, go.
She knows something's up.
He sneaks out, closes the door, goes there.
He said, I get up to the counter and I go.
My name's so-and-so, such-and-such, they're like.
Hoping there's a flight for him.
Yeah, she goes, okay, you've got a ticket, hold on.
Prints it out, gets on the thing, calls the girlfriend,
from the air phone, calls the girlfriend and he's like,
listen, I'm on the plane, he's like,
if I don't know if it's gonna make it out of airspace,
these guys wake up, it's the government,
they don't make phone, cold call,
they can turn you around.
Oh yeah, turn the plane right around.
So he's like, I don't know, he said, man,
he said, look, when they said they had left,
like they were leaving the airspace
and they were here in international waters or whatever,
he said, man, I was sweating bullets.
He's got this, that's not the only thing,
he's got like three other parts of that story
that are just all international shit,
like literally the CIA ends up showing up.
They come in as FBI.
Yeah.
He's been interviewed by the FBI.
Then two days later, two more FBI show up,
they go, hey, so-and-so, FBI, we need to ask you some questions.
He says, they asked me a whole another series of questions
that are similar to the other questions.
He says, but they know other stuff
and they're asking me about other people.
He goes, I didn't realize that the people
I was dealing with were so important.
Turns out then his lawyer comes in
and he tells them about the other guys that came,
the other FBI agents that came in,
then the lawyer calls the FBI and the FBI goes,
did you see badges?
He goes, they go, they weren't FBI.
And his lawyer says, he goes, that's fucking CIA.
He goes, are you serious?
He goes, did you see badges?
He goes, well, no, but I didn't ask for badges.
They think I had in the prison.
Not that they couldn't have provided FBI badges,
but he's like, holy shit, because they're asking about,
he's dealing with guys that are like generals,
guys that are like top dog.
I told you his whole story, you would be so,
it is so hilarious.
You know how he raised money?
He raised like $40,000 for his lawyer?
How?
Facebook.
Go fund me.
Yeah, he goes on Facebook.
Well, I think it's just,
I think the way he explained it, I didn't know much.
Oh my God.
He literally, he had been locked up for like six months.
They're telling him he's getting like 30 years.
He contacts his girlfriend.
He says, look, and she tells him all the time,
look, people are asking where you are there.
Cause he's such a nice guy, man.
He's really a great guy.
And like people are going crazy.
They're asking me where I am.
What do I tell him?
What do I tell him?
And she's like, some people know that you're in jail.
What do I tell him?
So he goes, I need you to send me,
he goes, I need you to send out this right now.
Cause I met this lawyer.
He can help me.
He wants 40 grand.
I don't have it.
He goes, so I need you to send this out.
He said, and he tells him everybody,
look, I've been doing this and laundering money doing this.
Some of you guys know me as everybody knows me.
He said, they've taken all of my money.
They've taken all my properties.
They've taken everything I have.
He says, and now they're going to take the only thing
that I was holding onto, which was my pride.
I need $40,000 to get a lawyer to help me get out.
So that I don't get a 30 year sentence.
I don't care if you can send me $5, send it.
If you can send me a thousand, send it.
I'm begging you to send me anything you can
to help me get this lawyer.
And he leaves the lawyer's address and number and everything.
He said about $20,000 to $30,000 showed up
at the lawyer's office.
Over the, guys are doing fund raisings.
People are going through and telling other coworkers
about him and what an amazing person is.
People are giving them $20, $50, $40.
The lawyer finally comes back and says,
listen, open a PayPal account or something.
He says, I'm getting checks in for $15.
I'm getting checks in for $7.
I'm getting checks in for $50, $112.
He goes, you got to open a PayPal.
It's more work.
It's more work to cash all these checks.
It costs too much cash to check, so yeah.
He raised the, it's like 40 or 40.
He raised the 40 or $45,000 in about a month and a half.
Amazing.
Fucking amazing.
The girlfriend still comes to see him.
I'm telling you right now,
no girlfriend or wife hangs out with you.
When you get like 15 years and he got like 15 years,
he got it cut and he did like six or seven years.
Probably, he's getting out now.
He's probably six or seven years, I'll bet he ends up doing.
She was down the whole time coming to see him.
Really?
Listen, you're, not only is she an amazing person
to be that dedicated to him,
but you have to be a phenomenal person.
The guy is, he is one of the best guys I've ever met.
Just, maybe it's because he's a con man,
but you immediately like him.
He's just super, everybody loved one.
Really?
Yeah, and he was born in fucking.
Coleman, right?
Well, he was.
He got moved to an ICE facility, right?
To, you know, that's the immigration, yeah.
Oh.
Those facilities are horrible.
He said like the first fucking,
first or second day he was there,
some guard got thrown over like a,
like a balcony was thrown off the balcony.
I mean, these guys are stabbing each other.
They're attacking the guards.
They're just, it's vicious.
Holy.
And he's in there, a nonviolent guy
who owned a couple of businesses and he's like,
oh, hi.
Yeah, he's, so, but he should be getting out soon.
Are you still in contact with him?
No, but I know a girl that knows him.
Okay.
And she's actually, the girl,
let's say my assistant.
Yeah.
She was the girl that was helping me on the street,
like do research.
Right, got it.
Right, she's one of them.
Okay.
Through him.
So I don't talk to him because first of all,
they don't have it.
You can't talk to him, but.
Well, it's not that, I mean, it is that I can't,
but also I, the only way to contact him is through,
they don't have the core link system there.
So I would have to write a letter and, you know,
I'm a lazy shit.
Yeah, got it.
You know, I'm a bad friend.
I think we've established that I've got some flaws.
You're not as good of a guy as he is.
Yes, yes.
He's the kind of guy that, yeah,
he's a much better person.
Right.
And she's told me multiple times,
cause I call her and say, hey, how's he doing?
This and that.
She's like, you know, you could write him a letter.
And I'm like, yeah, I know.
She goes, you know what, Matt?
You could even write an email and send me,
I could mail it to him.
And I'm like, okay.
I know I'm a shit.
That's so much work.
I know I'm a shit.
Okay.
Yeah, but people in there like that, man.
I.
You know, that passes out the time for him.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Right, it does though.
You're trying to get me?
No, I'm just saying, right?
That's what they like to hear.
I mean, I'll write him a letter.
I will write him a letter.
I love Juan.
Everybody loves Juan.
Write Juan a letter, man.
I want to get Juan on it.
Now that I'm a shit, I can't.
We're going to get Juan on the podcast.
Oh, listen.
If Juan told you a story and he's a great story.
Is he?
Is he a good talker?
Oh my God.
He's a con man, of course he is.
Of course he is.
Yeah.
Not just that.
I mean, extremely charismatic.
And he's got the whole Latin thing going on.
Oh yeah.
It's beautiful.
I love him.
Yeah.
Funny, charismatic, charming.
Latino.
Got a little bit of an accent.
Yeah.
You know, he's got a big fucking chain.
You know, who comes to see their boyfriend?
They're not even married.
I mean, guys that are married,
their wives aren't coming.
Unless you're filthy rich, you're what, you're done.
Yeah, that makes me think there's something in it for her.
What's she sticking around for, really?
I don't know.
There's something.
No, I ain't nobody sticking around for charm for 15 years.
No fucking way.
15 years.
It's not 15 years.
No woman, that's for sure.
He said six or seven, right?
Yeah, it's probably six or seven,
because he's got a sentence.
They've been sticking around for two years.
Not for you, but maybe for Juan.
Not for nobody with charm.
And to me, that's what I keep saying.
He's got a great personality.
I have money.
Please, you're fucking blind.
And he's like, no, I don't know what it is.
I don't even know.
She's a good person.
No way.
Plus, he's also spinning her too,
that she's thinking he's getting out any time,
because he hadn't got his sentence.
He's like, I'm waiting.
They're doing this.
He's thinking he's going to walk out of jail.
He didn't walk out of jail.
They cut his sentence, but he didn't walk out.
He didn't get as much as he thought.
So he should be walking out any day.
And I say, I got a fucking call.
What's your name?
That was a wonderful podcast.
Let's wrap this shit up and go eat.
It's 11 o'clock.
The only place open is Taco Bell,
so I hope you don't mind Taco Bell.
You know, do they have a waffle?
They have taco salads.
Oh, you want to go to Waffle House?
Fucking love Waffle House.
I love Waffle House.
I love a greasy spoon.
Hell yeah, we're going to Waffle House.
Bacon, I like bacon.
I'm glad you said that.
I forgot about Waffle House.
I've never been there in a while.
Love Waffle House.
Hell yeah.
Well, thanks for joining us on another great podcast.
Thanks, Matt.
This one?
Yeah, fuck yeah.
This one, not the last one.
Listen, you're so funny.
Hey, by the way, subscribe to Matt's.
Hey, he's not doing this for free, right?
We got a plug.
We're trying to fucking get Matt monetized on YouTube.
And he needs, how many hours do you need?
4,000.
4,000 watch hours.
400 and something.
Go fucking spend the rest of your day
watching his videos on YouTube, because he won't fucking
monetize until he gets 4,000 watch hours.
He's already got enough subscribers.
You already got 1,000 subscribers.
I got 2,000.
2,000 now.
And here's the thing, too.
What's your YouTube channel called?
Oh, it's called Inside True Crime.
So you can't search Matthew Cox.
You got to search Inside True Crime.
That's how you get it to rank number one.
It's got my picture, like, you know.
Yeah, yeah, you got that fucking.
But you know, it's so funny.
It's a suave picture on there.
I'm putting two more, in the next week or so,
I should have two more podcasts,
but two more of the audio books.
I call them a book, because they're only an hour long.
So I got two more of those.
Frank Amadeo's is on there now.
I got like three or four of them on there right now.
I got nine days in the Congo, which everybody was fucking
going nuts over.
Where are they?
Man, it's already got, like, 500, 600 subscribers.
It's been up, like, a day or two.
Wow.
They're loving the fucking Amadeo.
Well, you get to see them in action.
But yeah, I'm going to have two or three.
So really, in the next fucking two weeks,
I'll probably have another two or three of those on.
So I'm getting them all done.
It's going to be good.
It's good.
It's good stuff.
Go check out Matt's YouTube channel.
