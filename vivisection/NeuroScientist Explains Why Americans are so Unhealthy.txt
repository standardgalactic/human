In Africa, there's a certain part of Africa where they actually have two copies of these genes
called APOE4. If you have one copy, you get one from mom, one from dad, right? If you have one
copy, we know that it raises your risk of getting Alzheimer's disease. If you've got two copies,
we know it really increases your risk of getting Alzheimer's disease. We know that in these populations,
in certain groups in Africa, they have two copies, but they never get Alzheimer's disease. And that's
all got to do with epigenetics, which is why here in America, people don't have these copies.
Maybe they don't have the APOE4 gene, but they're still getting Alzheimer's disease.
Isn't that insane? That's wild. And I assume that that has a lot to do with diet.
It's got a lot to do with many things like risk factors such as sleep deprivation,
diet, lack of exercise, lack of social connection, believe it or not.
