Hi, Louisa.
Hi, Danny.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, it's nice to meet you too.
So you're a Greek-Australian, is that right?
I am.
Wow, that's a unique combination.
Greek Cypriot, I should say.
Living in Australia, born and raised in Australia,
but I live in New York.
Wow.
I know. It's insane.
So you said you were born and raised in Australia?
Yeah, I was born and raised in Australia.
My grandparents were born in Cyprus.
How long did you live there?
You moved to New York?
Well, I moved to New York in 2017.
Oh, wow. Not that long ago.
Australia is a crazy place.
People might hate me for saying this.
I think it's the best country in the world.
I love Australia.
I think a huge percentage of our listeners are from Australia too.
Oh, perfect.
I say best country because of A, healthcare,
B, education.
But it's very hard to move forward
in a population
of 22 million as opposed to America.
Yeah.
Well, I mean, they have also some of the best surf in the world.
Oh, yeah.
I have a lot of friends who go there all the time,
multiple times a year to surf,
like Kira and Snapper Rocks
and a lot of the cool places they have out there.
Yeah, I spent around a month
or two months in doing an internship
around Snapper.
That was back in when I was very young.
Yeah, I got to get out there.
Australia also was like one of the craziest places
during COVID too.
I saw some of the videos on social media
of people being locked down
in concentration camps
and getting their asses beat by cops and stuff.
Yeah, I was one of those people.
Were you really?
Yeah, so what happened was I was on the plane
coming back to Australia,
and I was really excited.
And it was while I was in the plane
that the government decided,
well, the prime minister decided to say
straight into lockdown.
My phone wasn't working on the flight.
We landed, and here I was thinking,
great, I'm so excited.
I'm going to be able to go and see my family.
As soon as we landed,
we had cops.
We had everybody just stopping us.
I thought we were in trouble.
We weren't allowed to talk.
It was as if we had committed a crime.
And we just got sent straight into a room
and we were locked in this room
for 14 days.
I didn't have any air.
I had no idea what was happening.
I just got off a 24-hour flight.
I was hungry. I was tired. I was scared.
I had no idea what was happening.
So what did they do? What did you do after that?
How long did you stay in that room for?
Did you have to go quarantine in a hotel or something?
No, that was the hotel.
14 days in there.
Then they set us free.
That's bizarre.
And now when you look back into it,
and we're not going to get into the whole COVID politics,
it really is crazy.
We thought it was bad here. Florida wasn't bad.
I guess relative to every other state,
everyone says Florida had it the best.
I don't know. I didn't really travel that much
out of Florida during those two years.
But yeah, man, some of the videos
just really, really shocked me.
I don't know if it's like...
Because I know Australia,
if I'm not wrong,
they do the most of their imports
come from China.
They're really tight with China.
But yeah, I don't know.
That was insane.
And so, okay.
So you are a neurophysiologist?
Correct.
When did you get into this kind of stuff?
So I...
First of all, let's define what it is.
It's a subspecialty of neurology.
So you know a neurologist,
you go and see a neurologist, maybe you have a headache
or maybe you're suspected
of having some sort of trauma
from the neck up, let's just say.
A neurophysiologist is a subspecialty.
So you go in to a neurophysiologist
if you may have had
suspected of having multiple sclerosis,
for example.
Neurophysiologists will hook you up to an EMG,
an electromyography, maybe test your nerves,
do a nerve conduction study,
or better yet, test for epilepsy
using an EEG scan.
And I became fascinated
with the EEG scans.
So that's my primary modality.
There's electroencephalograms.
You put the cap on your head, you've got all these leads coming out.
What they do is they assess
the functionality of your brain.
So we've got different brain waves.
You've heard of them, Alpha, Delta.
So we've got these brain waves
and we can figure out what's happening in your head
and how well your brain is functioning with an EEG.
It's the first point of call
if you've had a seizure.
You go and see a neurophysiologist
see what's going on in your brain.
So that's pretty much
what a neurophysiologist is.
And I got into this.
I started off as a triathlete, actually.
So I was racing for Australia.
Loved it.
My favorite was the best thing in the world.
My parents told me, you know, you may want to have a backup plan
because this may not be what you want to do
for the rest of your life.
So I went and studied, I did exercise physiology
and then studied mathematics
and then I went and studied medicine.
Exercise physiology.
Yeah.
What is that?
Well, it's like the study of
the science and physiology
of movement.
Okay.
Yeah, I mean, I remember I used to read
like back in the day I used to like hear these
this is like 10 years ago
I used to read these Tony Robbins books
and he would talk about how like
if you do, you say yes
and you throw your arms in the air
you can change your brain.
Your movement changes your brain
and then down or doing jumping jacks and all this stuff
will put you in a whole new brain state
and make you change you from being depressed
to super confident.
And that kind of stuff really works.
Yeah, I remember when he used to say that changing your state.
Your state, that's the word he used.
Yeah.
I mean, to an extent it's like, well, yeah, if you're feeling down
and you get up and you get a jolt of
blood flow to the brain.
Yeah, you're going to feel a bit different, right?
He just had a way of saying it.
So like what is the main thing
when you're studying this kind of stuff?
What is like the lowest hanging fruit
of issues people deal with
that you can help them with?
So what I specifically look into
is Alzheimer's disease.
It's what I'm currently researching and publishing
right now and I fell in love with that
because I did around a thousand brain scans
and I was picking up on early
onset Alzheimer's disease and we can pick up on that, right?
So we can pick up on a brain
who, you know, somebody may come into
the clinic and say, look, I'm
50 years old,
48 years old, I'm having memory difficulties.
I just, my long-term memory
is fine but my short-term memory, I just can't
remember the sometimes people's names
or the street I live on or I can't remember where my car keys are.
Can you test me?
And, you know, we take them through
a number of different tests and one of these tests
would be a neurocognitive test where we'll put the cap
on and we'll take them through
a series of cognitive drills
and we'll assess their brain function
and we're picking up on early onset Alzheimer's disease.
So after around
a thousand of them, I started to question
why
do we have so many people in the world
who currently have Alzheimer's disease?
Because I don't know if you know the stats
but 50 million people worldwide
currently have Alzheimer's disease or maybe it's
about 55 million people.
That number is said to triple by the year
2050.
And if you really dig into the research, what you find
is that out of that 50 million
only around 3 to 5%
got there
through genes.
So the other 95%
why are they getting Alzheimer's disease?
Why are we getting mild cognitive impairment
if you don't possess the genes that are responsible
for getting you there?
Why is that?
That's what we're going to talk about today.
That was the birth of my, you know, really
what I do now.
Was there a disparity of people
who suffer from Alzheimer's or early onset Alzheimer's?
Like a disparity between
different countries?
Really great question because we know that
in Africa, there's a certain part of Africa
where they actually have
two copies of these genes
called APOE4.
Okay? If you have one copy
you get one from
mom, one from dad, right? If you have one copy
we know that it raises your
risk of getting Alzheimer's disease.
If you've got two copies we know it
really increases your risk
of getting Alzheimer's disease.
We know that in these populations
in certain groups in Africa
they have two copies but they never get Alzheimer's disease.
Wow. Yeah.
Interesting. And that's all got to do with epigenetics
which is why here in America
or in other parts of the world as well
why people don't have these copies
maybe they don't have the APOE4 gene
but they're still getting Alzheimer's disease.
Isn't that insane?
That's wild and I assume that has a lot to do
with like diet.
It's got a lot to do with many things like risk factors
such as sleep deprivation, diet
lack of exercise
lack of social connection believe it or not
inflammation
neural inflammation
coming from the foods that we eat.
Right. That's wild.
Yeah, that's something you don't really
hear about a lot especially
around here. You never hear like
something you hear people like
complaining about being forgetful
and people talk about all kinds of things
that you can do to improve your health
like exercise and diet but no one really
talks about how that connects to
your brain or how that affects
Alzheimer's. People don't really worry about that
until they get older. How young
what's like the youngest person you could
find that has this stuff?
Most people you're right. Most people don't
worry about it until they're let's say
70 then they go in and they're diagnosed
with Alzheimer's disease but
we have to remember that Alzheimer's disease
and neurological conditions like
this or dementias I should say
is not a one time
stamp or a one time point
in time. It is
an accumulation of the previous
20 years.
So you could be developing Alzheimer's disease
in your 30s, in your 40s
and in your 50s and because it takes a long
time to actually
come into fruition
by the time you get your first symptom
at around 65 or 70
it's already too late.
It's like you know
I don't know too much about pancreatic cancer
but I've lost two people in my life from that
and it's the same thing it's like they're fine
and then out of nowhere oh I have this pain
oh you've got stage 4
pancreatic cancer you've got two weeks
to live. How does somebody
keep track of their brain health
like that and I mean other than getting
basic blood work that checks like your
lipids and all that kind of stuff like how would
you determine how far down that road
you are? Well you said
basic blood work and
so I have a practice right now so my company's
called NeuroAthletics. I've got
10 people on my team in combination of exercise
physiologists and physicians
and we do comprehensive blood work
and this is because you will go
to your doctor and they
will order you just some
your routine blood work right
and what they're detecting
in a doctor's office which they'll probably give you 15
minutes to really deconstruct it they're just
making sure that you're not dying today
they're not picking up on trends
and so we have to be mindful
to pick up on trends and a number
of different biomarkers from brain
chemistry and different blood chemistry
biomarkers that can be suggestive
of what way
where you're trending
we can look at lipids, we can look
at cholesterol, we can look at B vitamins
but the first point
of call in my opinion is to look at
genes and you can do a DNA test
like 23 and me kind of stuff
correct you can look
and see if you actually have these genes
okay there's three genes
that are
like if you've got these genes
it's you're going to get
familial Alzheimer's disease
right so these genes are
Precinellin 1, Precinellin 2
and Ameloid Precursor protein
right but then you've got
the ApoE4 genes and you can test
for all of these and even if you have
these ApoE4 genes it does not mean
that you are
destined to get Alzheimer's disease
but I think
we need to have a conversation
around getting your genes tested
because I didn't know this but there is a lot of people out there
who are scared to actually get their genes
tested did you know that?
No
but I imagine there's probably a
big barrier to entry doing something like that
because it's I'm sure it's expensive
and it's not like... Not really
No it's actually not isn't I mean
look I haven't done it I did my genes
somewhere else I didn't do it 23 in me
but I think it's under $100
Oh really? Interesting
So it's actually not that dear
you can get this you can ask somebody who does it
we do it with everybody at our practice
and we're really testing for that
we're testing for a number of different things
but that's the main thing we're testing for
so that's the first point of call
then we have to go through figuring out
lipids and you can also go through
neurocognitive scans you know we
do a brain scan on most of our
most of our clients as well I need to do a brain scan
I was feeling that the waves would be
very mild but here's the
thing I use the exact same hospital
grade EEG on
a mild cognitive impairment
patient as I would
on an MBA an all-star
MBA player
What would be the difference in the brain scan
from like a super athlete compared to an average person?
Well I'm picking up specifically
on areas of dysfunction
first and foremost and we'll go into
that what that is but what I'm picking up on
specifically this brain scan looks at
information processing speed
and reaction time
so reaction time we have to remember
things like your eyes you don't see
with your eyes you see with your brain
you don't hear with your ears
you hear with your brain
so if you have a well functioning brain
you're probably going to see faster and hear faster
right but what if your brain
is even better functioning
and we optimize that you're probably going to see
faster right
and hear better therefore reducing
your reaction time so we can measure
reaction time we have a stimulus
that measures
neuronal reaction time
really yeah so we can actually measure
the speed at which
so you have a stimulus there's a computer
so you've got this EEG scan on
there's a computer maybe a ball will come up
and you have to click the button
to measure reaction time over a 20 minute period
or a 10 to 20 minute period
so we can measure that we can measure visual
acuity how well
you are seeing the
the ball coming onto the screen
so an NBA player
this could mean the difference between
one or 50 million dollars
right because we increase
the reaction time
we increase their speed
and we increase or
decrease the reaction time and increase their
information processing speed
meaning
at what time do I know that that is a ball
in front of me
it takes your brain you know
0.5 milliseconds if we can get it to 0.3
they're going to be able to get the ball
pass it more accurately
and in a faster way therefore
making more points in the
in the game more points in a season
therefore becoming an all star
so you're saying
is it possible to improve
these types of things
oh yeah that's what we do
like right now
we were talking offline and I brought some
stroke goggles here with me
because you said you were really interested
in visual acuity
I'm obsessed with it
I actually had a
vision scientist doctor in here
probably six months ago
and he was explaining
he wrote a bunch of books on this stuff
and he's done this research his whole life
he's Dr. David Cook
he's based in Atlanta
and he has a bunch
of exercises people can do
to increase visual acuity
and to
even like people who have
poor vision
say like 2040, 2050 vision
they can do things
like throwing their
there's a bunch of crazy exercises he has
but he's proven that doing these things
for a long period of time you can actually
improve that stuff and get yourself out of glasses
hmm
so if you can do that
then you can also improve
even if you have great vision
the best vision I've seen is in baseball players
they've got like 20 over 8
yeah that's crazy
and the information processing speed
of hitting a fast ball
going 100 miles an hour is insane
and what people still think is
yes you do have to have some level of skill
yes there is
the physiology involved
the trajectory of the bat
the velocity at which you hit
but what is telling you to swing the bat
in that way it's your brain
right
and I realized this very early on
so in 2016
when I was still studying
I had a professor
and he's Australian and at the time
he was actually the red bull
this was back 2016
red bull was completely different
it's Jim
if you will
I think they've still got one it's in Malibu
or it was in LA
they were hosting an event
a high performance event
this is back when no one was really talking about high performance
and he actually said you should come to this event
it was 2016 in April
I'd never been to America
I said what is this event
he said you're going to love it
and I want you to talk to people about reaction time
there's going to be elite athletes
there's Formula One drivers and NBA players
had no idea who they were
and I gave this talk
and that's when everything started for me
there was an NBA player who said
can you help me with my reaction time
and I said to him what are you doing
in terms of brain training
and he said I'm not doing anything
I said well okay
then we can work together
I mentioned you on the phone too
it's funny if you look at some of the most famous
successful athletes
Jordan or Tom Brady
if you look at their photos
it looks like their eyes
are almost pointed outwards
especially for basketball players
because they're on this court
and they have full court vision
as well as maintaining cutie on a ball
but they have to see what's going on way over here
in their peripherals
and I was like wow I wonder if that's something
that they have inherently
or if that's something that's developed
from playing basketball for so long
in a really great field
so we can train it with these
specific strobe goggles right
so they're cut into four quadrants
and we can black out just the outer portions of it
so you can just see
in this pathway
or we can black out the inner portions
so you can see on the outside
or we can just do one quadrant
up here so if we test you
and we're doing all of these
different visual acuity depth perception
all these different types of tests
and we can see that
in the top right quadrant
of your right eye
you just don't seem to see the ball as well
so we're going to black out
every other part of your left eye
and every other quadrant of your right eye
and we're just going to keep the quadrant up here
free and we're just going to get you to throw the ball
for an hour a day
so then you're strengthening that
remember it's just like you're strengthening your biceps
we're going to strengthen that specific
part of your eye
and it's not what everyone should be doing
evidently
but when millions or tens of millions
of dollars is on the table
the guy was talking about David Cook
he actually has a lot of
I don't know about basketball players but I know he has a lot of baseball players
that come in there and they do
visual therapy training
where he was saying they swing balls
and they wear different color glasses
and they try to see what's going on
and read it while it's swinging
all kinds of crazy stuff that you would never imagine
so what I really love doing
and this is what we teach as well
I love doing things
such as working on the prefrontal cortex
of the brain
we've got four lobes of the brain
and the frontal lobe
houses the prefrontal cortex
it's right at the frontal part of the brain
and that's involved
in all of our executive functions
reaction time, focus
attention
inhibition
so if we can train that
you're probably also going to be a better athlete
right, yeah that makes sense
you said you brought these goggles with you
I brought them with me, they're somewhere in my
carry on
we're going to test them out, yeah let's do it
so what kind
are you currently working with
athletes doing this kind of stuff?
yeah, so I personally, I've got 20 clients
on my roster, eight of which are elite athletes
in three sports
Major League Baseball, Tennis
and NBA, they're all ball sports
and it's working on mainly
vision is what you're working on with them?
no, actually it's working on human performance
so we do everything from blood
we do blood, urine
stool, sweat
we do all of that, we do
brain scans and then we have the exercise
physiology component where we're doing VO2
max tests, then we're doing the brain scans
and we're doing the complete vision
visual acuity and everything
yeah, funnily enough
the rest of my clients, the other 12
are CEOs
and high level executives and you would think
oh are you doing the same thing
I'm doing the exact same thing with them
yeah, when it comes to, is it true that
the visual
cortex is responsible for
like 90% of the neuron
activity in your brain
or like the neural
what is the word, it is like
like the, you're talking about the occipital lobe
at the back of the brain?
from what I heard, I think I heard Andrew Huberman
say this, but he said that
as far as like the energy
that's produced, that it takes to run
your brain, 90% of the
energy it takes is taken up by the visual
cortex most likely
I mean, I'm not sure about that
because I think about, I mean if he said it
then that's probably true and he's a vision scientist
oh yeah, he is, doesn't he?
yeah, school of, I think
ophthalmology, and he's
published a lot of research in vision
science, we know that
the, you know, you've got
your eye and the optic nerve goes into
your brain and then you process the
visual information back here
in the occipital cortex and then goes into the frontal lobe
but the frontal lobe is
the biggest in houses, the most amount of neurons
the frontal lobe, which is not
associated with vision
to an extent it is, but most
yeah, most vision is
in the back of the brain
I think Andrew Huberman mentioned that he
used to not be able to see in 3D
and he like acquired 3D
vision doing like visual therapy and stuff like that
and that's why he got so interested in it
oh really, that was his, yeah, he was a skateboarder
as well, yeah, it's
interesting because before he was big and famous
I had him on my podcast, did you really?
yeah, very early in 2020
and he said, was he just
as handsome as he is now?
yes, I think so
I didn't see him with his shirt off, I mean
I just posted a photo, he never takes his shirt off
he always wears the long sleeves
yeah, but no, I had him on my podcast
and he was great and we were chatting
and he said to me, you know, there's going to be
some big things coming my way soon, Louisa
and I was like, really?
and then like next minute, he's unbroken
yeah, that guy's a powerhouse
the amount of podcasts
and videos that he puts out on his channel
is insane, he's a workhorse
you know what he's done, he's actually gotten the world
to be excited about neuroscience
yes, yes
science and performance protocols
and how to really improve performance
however, because of that
what I think is happening as well
is people are becoming
I think there's a lot of
dumb things that are happening on the internet
as it relates to human performance
okay, we can talk about that
just some things that are just false
information, misinformation
but what's also happening is people take things to the extreme
and become heroic
and we can see this with cold water
immersion, you know, people are getting
jumping into these freezing cold
ice baths, it's like that's
really not what you have
to do to get the effect
and you also don't have to get into an ice bath for
50 minutes
people are getting in there for crazy amounts
to try and be this hero
to try and take away from
to be the best, I did the best
I did the coldest and I did it for the longest
but that's not really in line with science
no, that's funny
I did mine, when I got my ice tub
I put it at like 35 degrees
and I was like, I was dying
and I texted Dom
and I was like, Dom, I'm not feeling too hot man
my chest hurts, I've been doing this every day
for the last two months, he's like
what temperature is it at? I'm like 35
for 34, forget what it was, something like that
mid 30s, he's like, yeah, that's way too fucking cold
he's like, all the studies
are done between 48 and 58
or something like that, you gotta up the temperature
yeah, and I usually say
if you can get into a bath for 3 minutes minimum
7 minutes maximum
and do it at
between 45 to 50
that's all, remember
wait, say that again? 45 degrees
remember, what you're doing
is you're trying to produce a stimulus
like a hormetic stress, you're trying to stress your body
to create these cold shock proteins
which
do many different things which we can talk about
the science of that, but if you get accustomed to that
it's not, you're not going to get the same effects
like, if you get cold
adapted
you're just like, you're going to get into the cold
and your body's going to be like
I don't know what this is like, so it's not going to produce
the effects that you want it to produce
so don't do it every day?
you can do it every day just to just be
you know, non-heroic, just getting there
45 degrees, getting for 3 minutes, get out
right, yeah
and then when you want the big effects, maybe you can crank it down super low
I always bring mine down
by 1 degree every
like 4 weeks
oh really? yeah, but then I travel
right, I've been in Miami
and I will be here, it's like 5 days
in total I think
that means I haven't done an ice bath in that long, so when I go back
it's going to be a bit of a shock to me
right, well that's like with anything right, you build up a tolerance
to any kind of
whatever, if it's a supplement
but getting back to like
the vision stuff, have you ever
do you guys do anything with red light therapy?
not really, not in terms of
vision, but we have a
red light therapy, like a panel
yeah, I heard that
that literally can rebuild the neurons
or like in your eyes
or in your vision, your visual cortex of your brain
I'm not sure about that
however, I will tell you that adult neurogenesis
doesn't exist, neurogenesis
is the creation of new neurons
and we can't really grow
new neurons, despite
what anybody thinks
where you can grow them though
is in deep within the temporal lobes
so the temporal lobes sit here
and deep within the temporal lobes behind
your ears sits these little
seahorse shaped structures called the hippocampus
and that's where most of our memory
consolidation happens
memories are formed in there
and we've got neurons in there
and they can grow
they can grow, yeah we can grow
new neurons in the hippocampus
okay
so we can get better connectivity
of neurons
in the sub regions
of the hippocampus
through exercise
making your brain be able to fire
better
but we can't grow, you can't just go out
and think that something is going to grow
a new neuron
in the prefrontal cortex
for example
because I'll tell you why, think about what happens in a stroke
a stroke
is pretty much an embolism
you'll get
somewhere in an artery
or a vessel you'll get a clot
that clot will stop oxygen
from going through
and delivering oxygen into that part of the brain
essentially what happens is
you kill off neurons
those neurons don't grow back
once you've had that in fact
it's an insult
you have to go to the
emergency room and they have to
get blood flow going back into the brain
you kill off neurons
you can't grow them back
what happens is the areas around
that in fact
will strengthen
but you don't grow new neurons
so the areas around it will try to compensate
correct and they can strengthen
is there any kind of cutting edge
research or science being done
to figure out how to grow new neurons
in these parts of the brain?
let's talk about exercise
do you want to go down the all exercise field?
sure
this episode of the podcast is brought to you by
Verso the older I get the more
I'm prioritizing my health
the goal is to keep my mind sharp and my body strong
if you've watched this podcast before
you might know that I'm
very much obsessed with health and longevity
and the things you can do
to hack your biology
to improve performance
I exercise daily and take my nutrition very seriously
but that can only get you so far
science has or scientists like David Sinclair
have now proven that we can reverse aging
with interventions that go far beyond
healthy habits
I like to keep up on all the latest science behind this stuff
that's why I keep up with my friend nutritional scientist
Dr. Dom D'Agostino
and people send me products
I like to test on myself to see what works and what doesn't work
that is why I use cell being
by Verso
it has scientifically proven ingredients
that combat the effects of aging by increasing
your NAD plus levels
that's the stuff that quite literally powers
every cell in your body
I personally have been taking cell being every single morning for years now
primarily because it enhances my mood
improves my energy levels
and I just feel like a younger version of me
clinical trials have even shown it improves
energy endurance cognition
fat loss and better more efficient sleep

okay so we have
we have three different types of exercise
that I'm going to talk about we've got aerobic
which is your long runs
okay it's around 60%
of your maximum heart rate
everyone should be doing this by the way we have
so many studies that suggest that even
walking can improve brain health
what's the isn't there like math
you can do like your age divided by
something is like what your
heart rate should be
yeah it's a really easy way
it's 220 minus your age
will be your maximum heart rate
220 minus your age is your maximum heart rate
so let's just say arguments say you're 20
years old that means your maximum heart rate
should be 20
200 yeah so then you
can say well okay great well if I
want to look at 65%
of my maximum heart rate you'll do 65%
of 200
alright but we're becoming more savvy
now we've got heart rate monitors
we've got ways of measuring our maximum
heart rate right so
your aerobic training is
you're running you're long running
you're long cycling you're long swimming
this does amazing things one
we have a lot of blood flow now I think
that's the key here we have to remember
what's good for the heart is good for the brain
so every time
we are getting more blood flow
to the brain we're getting oxygen and nutrients
that's what we want the survival
right and I have a theory
that dementia
is just a
disease of the vascular system
that makes sense okay
Alzheimer's disease is a disease of the vascular system
so we want so we have
you know let's just take a bit of an anatomy course
right now we've got our heart
and we've got this big chamber called the aorta
from the aorta we've got
these two branches that go up
into the brain we've got the carotid arteries
let's sit right here then we've got the vertebral arteries
okay they sit here
they go up obviously we've got
two on one on each side they go up
into the brain then we've got branching
off of that so they're the two
main arteries that go into the brain
there's a lot of blood flow that happens
it gets delivered in there and then we've got these little
capillaries as well they're the they're about
a hairline thick one cell thick
these arteries have
these walls around them
that are made of muscle
right so it's important for them
to stay healthy
and strong to deliver more blood
when we are
doing aerobic physical activity
we are strengthening the arteries
through blood flow we're strengthening
the heart we're getting something called cardiac
remodeling you can remodel your entire
cardiac system through exercise
but what we are getting the most beneficial effect
is we're getting the release of something called
BDNF
brain derived neurotropic factor
so
it is a growth factor for the brain
and that is the specific
growth factor that will grow
new neurons
in the hippocampus
so these studies all came out
first using mice so in around
1999 they did the first
some of the first studies on mice they got them
to wheel run and they were
determining what this does
in terms of brain health and they found
oh my gosh these mice
grow new neurons in the hippocampus
of their brains through
20 minutes of wheel running per day
but what they also do is
they grow new neurons
in all of the areas in the brain
wow this was just
on mice right we're not we're not rodents
but that was 1999 so they thought
scientists were like this is unbelievable
right so then
they fast tracked then in the early
2000s they wanted to replicate this
in humans so they replicated
the exact same study and what they
found was that humans
can't grow new neurons only in
the hippocampus but
they did find that they can get better
connectivity in the hippocampus sub regions
so just better connectivity of the neurons
in the areas around the brain
I thought that was good so this was all from
aerobic training
specifically around 65%
of maximum heart rate so
that's when the 2000s were all about
BDNF everyone was talking
I even remember back
in the early 2000s there was
news articles coming out saying BDNF
everyone loved it right
and ever since then
this gets back to your question earlier
pharmaceutical companies
are trying to replicate BDNF
to try and
bottle it up because if you
go right if we go into
a mouse and just
inject BDNF into their brain
they're just going to grow a bigger brain
likewise if we can inject
BDNF in a pharmaceutical
great agent into your hippocampus
you're going to have
a bigger hippocampus
we can see that because the more you
exercise
the better your hippocampus
but
what would the downside be of just injecting it
or taking a supplement you know
we can't we're never going to be able to do that
which is why exercise serves as medicine
exercise
is by far
and I want this like to really go out there
it is by far
the best therapeutic
agent that can starve off
neurodegenerative diseases
and the aging process
now what if you're somebody
who has neglected this your whole life
and now you're in your mid 30s
mid 40s whatever it might be
if you start doing this this is something that you
can reverse if you have some sort of
there is no reversal right
but we have to keep in mind
around 25 to 30 that's when your brain
fully develops around 30
then your brain begins
to atrophy in small amounts
no atrophy is decrease
in muscle cell size
or decrease in cell size if you will
so you start to get
you start to kill off neurons
at the age of 30 it's just due to the
natural brain aging process
we can see
the MRI of a 25 year old
brain and it's nice and thick
near the skull right there's just
a thin layer of fluid between the
brain and the skull
and then you can see the brain of a 90 year old
and then that space
is really thick between the skull
and the brain because the brain
atrophies right
exercise
along with other interventions
proper nutrition, proper hydration
and sleep
of course can slow the
progression of these
age related diseases
you can't reverse
Alzheimer's disease unfortunately
but you can slow the progression
and prevent Alzheimer's disease
from occurring
but you would think with the heart remodeling
and getting those
arteries that go up to your brain
by like opening those up
and making your heart stronger
that that would
you would think that that would help
for the time being but you would think
that that would sort of help
repair
but that's not the case
because let me tell you something else that happens
these arteries so we've got
arteries which are the big ones that have got the muscles
then we've got veins which are just one directional
pumps then we've got these little
capillaries or you say in America
capillaries
these little capillaries are the first
things to go
in any type of insult
or they're the first things to go
in hypertension so if you've got
blood pressure, high blood pressure
what happens
is your high blood pressure over time
ends up killing off
these tiny little blood vessels
these tiny little capillaries
they end up dying so what happens if you kill off the
capillaries in your brain
over time you've got less oxygen and less nutrients
going to the brain
you and I have probably killed them off
I know like
yeah I didn't start paying attention to any kind
of exercise or health though
I worked out when I went to the gym when I was in my teens
and twenties but I never paid attention
I ate shit and like never did cardio
until like recently honestly
well cardio like I said
it's absolutely phenomenal and back
to this whole chamber of the heart
what you want
is to be able to with each
you want to increase your stroke volume so with each pump
right let's just say your heart
contracts and then
your pump's blood with each pump
you want to with less efficacy
so you want to be able to have
as much blood flow as possible
right that's if you've got a strong chamber
if that chamber
which is the aorta and all of the other arteries
if they weaken
every time you do that one pump
maybe not enough blood will go up
right so it's about
efficacy as well so the more you train
that chamber of the heart
the stronger it gets
the walls of the artery become stronger
therefore it can push more blood
more forcefully with each contraction
and that's what we want
because we want less heart beats
with greater volume
of blood
right so that's what
Robic activity does
and it's really
devastating that
30% of Americans
don't meet the
necessary requirements
of cardiovascular fitness
which is 150 minutes a week
yeah no way
not even close
no that was only 30%
so 70%
of the US population
don't meet
how many minutes per week?
150
I only do like 20 minutes
every other day
so like 80 minutes a day
I have just one of those assault bikes
I only do that for like 20 minutes every other day
that's pretty short of the quota
and by the way an assault bike
you're probably actually getting out of the aerobic zone
that's it that's hard
no I stay right at
like 130-135
my heart rate
I try to take it easy
if I go normal I'll get up to like
in the 140s but I try to keep it kind of low
like zone 2
for everyone listening if you're thinking
okay well Louisa I don't know what my
thresholds are
the way to think about it is the best
training zone for this
this aerobic zone is when you know
that you're working out
you've got a bit of a sweat but you can have a conversation
with somebody so your heart is pumping
you know you're working
it's like when you're working on an incline
of a treadmill
you can feel it but you can still have
the conversation with somebody
that's where you want to aim to in 20 minutes a day
yeah that's interesting too
you know I've noticed that like
when I'm doing something like walking
or like riding the bike slow
or doing anything else that requires some sort of physical
exertion
I notice like I'm quicker
my mind is quicker because I'm not thinking about
what I'm gonna say I'm not thinking about anything
I'm just like talking but my part of my brain
is occupied doing something else
it's a weird thing
it's like the opposite of sitting here not doing anything
I'm just sitting here talking to you
it's like all my energy is going into talking
30% of my energy to talking
or having a conversation
or having whatever
it seems like it flows easier
there's more of a flow there
yeah you're also activating your sympathetic nervous system
which is that
fight or flight aspect of the nervous system
which is pretty much telling your body
to really hone in and focus
okay on something in front of you
because you're under attack per se
oh yeah yeah yeah
but that's you know
that's a really interesting field
this aerobic activity
what I think is actually more exciting
if we fast forward
to 2012
there was a really great study that came out
by Harold et al
really great team who thought
you know what
what's the effects of resistance training
on the brain because all of the studies
have been done on aerobic
physical activity
what are the effects on resistance training
in a systematic review
they went and pulled together all of the
randomized control trials that have been done
on resistance training
and what they found was that
resistance training
produces way more benefits
than aerobic training
in my opinion
well not anaerobic resistance
so weight training
isn't that the same thing as anaerobic
depends on how fit you are
anaerobic is when you're reaching that threshold
of you know above 85%
got it
which you need that as well and we can talk about that
so this is where my area
so I'm about to publish
a study like the most up to date study
that's done on the effects of resistance training
on mild cognitive impairment patients
interesting yeah
so what happens is
you will you know if you
contract your biceps for example
you're doing a weight
within the cells
of your muscles
you have these little things called myokines
they're muscle based proteins
so they're just tiny little proteins and they only
live in the cells
of your muscle fibres
so when under tension
once you contract these muscles
what happens is
these myokines spurt out
we've got around
500 of them
right 500 of these
tiny little bad boys they're in your muscle
500 myokines in your whole body
well 500 that we know of
hopefully I'll find another one and call it the Louisa
but you know I would say
500 but we really only have studied
around 50 of them right
and they're really beneficial
what happens is once they go
once they you know you contract your muscle
they spurt out of the muscle
and they go into the bloodstream
once there they have
they go and lodge in different
receptors so you actually have receptors
imagine a receptor just like this
and a myokine coming
and lodging like that
you've got receptors on your pancreas
on your heart on your liver
on your spleen and in your brain
and these receptors are
absolutely phenomenal they are
what they do is once these myokines go into them
and lodge into them they have beneficial effects
on the prefrontal cortex
on the occipital cortex
they have
they basically help your brain
function better
and it can change the structure of your brain
so jacked people are smarter
I don't know
about smarter level of intelligence
wasn't really measured
however we know that these myokines
are actually having an effect
on helping with the proliferation
of BDNF
so there's one specific myokine
I love it it's called irisin
it was founded
not long ago
it was probably 2012 as well
but irisin comes
they named it after the greek god iris
iris was a messenger to the god
irisin does this
so when it goes into the bloodstream
out of the muscle it goes up
and remember BDNF
the growth factor
it actually helps BDNF express itself
so you create more BDNF
in the presence of irisin
which then helps with the proliferation
of new neurons in the hippocampus
and then you've got other ones
you've got cathepsin B
you've got lactate
and then you've got this really wonderful one
which was founded by the way by Benta Peterson
she's incredible
in Copenhagen
IL-6
have you heard of IL-6?
it's a pro-inflammatory cytokine
so we used to be scared of IL-6
we didn't want it right
when we got sick
if we secreted more IL-6
we didn't want to
we didn't want to secrete more IL-6
what Benta Peterson found
was that IL-6 is also
living in the muscles
and when it's secreted
from the muscles
it acts as an anti-inflammatory cytokine
so instead of
creating more inflammation
it creates less inflammation
it helps dampen inflammation
so it becomes anti-inflammatory
and this is when it comes out of the muscles?
yes, when it comes out of the muscle cell
and why would it do that?
that's just what it does
and it lodges in nearby organs
and this is this new phenomenon
called the brain-body crosstalk
they're now doing studies
on myokines
and it's a great study
I put it up, I did a presentation yesterday
it was published in CellPress
they're showing that these myokines
can inhibit tumor cell growth
in the prostate
wow, that's fascinating
so that last study you were telling me about
that came out when?
not too long ago
it was around five years ago
published in CellPress
Cell is a very high stringent journal
and they're showing the effects
of these myokines inhibiting
these tumor cell growth
in prostate cancer
yeah, that's interesting
which means that
sorry, I just have to say
one more time, exercise can serve
as preventative medicine
do you notice any sort of
has anyone ever done any sort of
study or analysis
of an NBA player
as far as their
how healthy their brain is
towards the end of their life
compared to somebody else
because as far as aerobic exercise
who puts themselves through that much
like 90 minutes of sprinting
back and forth on a basketball court
I don't know in terms of specific brain health
however, I would argue that
at tour de France
in that concept
do you know why? because tour de France have the highest recording
VO2 maxes
yeah
we've got VO2 max scores
of like 90 for these tour de France guys
what exactly, I mean I see it
on my watch, my VO2 max
what exactly does it mean?
it's a measure of cardio respiratory fitness
basically
how much oxygen you can uptake
and utilize
per kilogram
so
how old are you?
36, I mean I don't know the cutoffs
I had this graph up yesterday
but we can determine, you know your VO2 max
I wouldn't determine it using an Apple watch
we can get more intelligent
and sophisticated machines for that
we have a VO2 max
device that we use
and you put it on and you perform
a 12 minute
running test if you will
it's horrible
really?
you basically have to go into your gas out
which is go into your almost collapse
so it has something to do with your respiratory rate
and your heart rate
like the combination of the two
and the amount of oxygen that you uptake
so how the hell would a watch be able to figure that out?
exactly why
I would tell you not to do that
basically it's probably calibrating
when you get to your
highest
heartbeat I guess
so
we've got aerobic training
we've got resistance training
we both know that they're beneficial
cave it with resistance training
because I have to tell my mother this every day
it doesn't work, you don't get the effects of these myokines
unless you're really pushing heavy
really?
you have to be pushing 80% of your one repetition max
80% of your
one repetition max
so if you can deadlift 100 kilos
right?
I don't know what a kilo is
100 pounds
whatever
if you can deadlift 100 pounds
you want to be doing 80 pounds
got it
when you're working out
you want to be generally doing resistance training
four times a week
again going back to what the government says
their recommendations is three to four week
four times a week of resistance training
hmm
that's
interesting
so you would say that the resistance training
or the weight lifting is equally as if not
probably more important than the aerobic stuff
I mean both are important however
I am biased towards resistance training
just because of the multitude of studies
we have now showing its beneficial effects
and I've heard that
muscle retention
or that muscle mass has some sort of
benefit as well
somebody who can hold on to a lot of muscle
versus somebody who has none
for an example
a female in their 30s
who is super skinny
and the typical
vogue model
fashion type girl or compared to somebody
who actually lifts weights
and retains muscle
what are the actual
measurable health benefits between those two people
well muscle mass
is first and foremost
it's an endocrine organ
muscle mass is a
storage ground for glucose
right so if these two girls
right you got the skinny one
and then the one with muscle
let's just say arguments say
they're both the same age
and we give them both
a candy bar
and you get a little bit of glucose
you will see so what happens when you eat
you get a spike
have you ever worn a glucose monitor
you get that spike
and then maybe depending on how well
you can tolerate that glucose
that spike may come down
your postprandial spike it may come down
or it may just stay up there
the person who has more muscle
that muscle will uptake that glucose
it's basically their muscle is like a sink
so it can take in all of this glucose
okay so their postprandial spike will come
straight back down whereas the person
who doesn't have any muscle
their glucose is just going to be floating
around in their bloodstream because it's got
nowhere to go it's not getting
up taken and why is that bad
well we don't want excess glucose because
that can lead to insulin resistance because
what happens is once you get so
insulin is a hormone
and it's pretty much the only hormone
that is there served to
bring down glucose
you know floating
around in our bloodstream
what happens over time
is if you keep having glucose
and you've got
your pancreas that just keeps shooting out
this insulin
over time it becomes weak
okay so over time
there's more glucose
insulin has to like if it's doing it
at a one to one ratio like glucose to insulin
that's okay then it becomes
a two to one so glucose
is coming up and it's like okay
I'm more tolerated to insulin now so insulin
is like okay I'm going to double myself
so insulin is coming out and trying to dampen it down
then it comes up even more
and it's like a three to one
right and that's when you become more
resistant to insulin
and that leads
to diabetes
type 2 diabetes when you become
insulin resistant
okay so
to prevent this from
happening you don't want a lot of glucose
in the bloodstream
so glucose
A you either don't have the sugar
or B you
can have a lot of muscle mass meaning that
you don't necessarily go and
like eat all this candy but if you did
it is a storage ground and a sink
for all those glucose molecules
to go in there therefore insulin doesn't have to
work as hard so you starve
off insulin resistance
now
why do some people
bodybuilders specifically
like to eat tons of glucose
and carbs before workouts versus
some of them like Dom they like to work out
and lift weights fasted after
hours of being fasted
oh my god there's just so much research around that
Dom's a keto guy though isn't he
he's a hardcore keto guy
yeah he's hardcore yeah I know
look he's done most of the studies on ketones
but
mainly because it's the
best place for when you are doing
a when you want to lift heavy
and contract your muscles and be able to lift harder
you need the carbohydrates
yeah you do need the carbohydrates
well you don't need the carbohydrates but I'm
guessing that bodybuilders since that's not my
world are ingesting
carbs maybe like I think it's
like maybe 10 to 12 grams
right yeah because I was talking
to Dom like I
went down like the keto rabbit hole a couple
years ago and I did it for a couple years
and I felt great and then I stopped and I started
eating just regular you know the regular
amount of carbs I went like probably
50% carbs 50% fat just like a normal
diet and I did that for
about a year and I just recently started
like really nuking the carbs
and cutting them back a lot and like right now
I'm kind of going through like the fatigue of my body
adjusting to that
the quote unquote keto flu or whatever you call it
it's a keto flu yeah yeah I'm
suffering from that right now and I was talking to
Dom just yesterday about that and I was
telling him like look I'm like the only carbs I'm eating
before workouts I'm only eating like bananas and
fruits and stuff before workouts he's like drop that
he's like you don't need any of that cut out
all that before the workout go in fasted
and he's like you'll feel
much better you'll recover quicker
as well as like this this stuff
this keto start
that he has like
it's like
exogenous ketone supplement that you can
drink that basically kicks your body into
ketosis but he's using fat
as fuel or ketones as fuel because remember
you have to use
the primary fuel source for the brain
is glucose
but when glucose is in present it will use
ketones which is better
well I mean it's not better
or worse
it's just depending on who you really speak to
it's if you want to use
fat as your fuel
then you'll probably do a fasted
workout and because you've already got
a storing of
fat and ketones built up
but if you want to use
carbohydrates as fuel then
you're not doing the ketogenic diet
where I see that having a problem is
if you're doing the keto diet and then you then
go and ingest a bunch of carbs
then you can have problems
then you can screw up your system
you've got to be really strict
I can't just right now in my career
like today
I'm just travelling so much I don't think I could ever do a
I've tried it though and I felt great
yeah I feel better than ever when I do it
especially like if I'm doing stuff like this
I want to be like able to talk
and produce
coherent vocabulary
it helps a lot
and even like drinking these exogenous ketones
it helps a lot too
but like I always thought that ketones
like when your body is running on ketones and using that
for energy that I always
thought that was the optimal way
for us to
burn energy and for us
to work
and for our bodies to
burn energy
like if you even think of like animals
animals that have to go for days
and weeks without eating
they're burning ketones
so they have to be like super quick
super reactive like a cheetah
I actually was
starting to have exogenous ketones
when I was
during my
I did some exams for
interpretive neurophysiology and during those
it was last year
and for a week
I was just having these ketone shots
and what I found was that I was able to
it suppressed my appetite
for starters
second thing is I felt like I had brain
fuel that lasted me all
throughout the night whereas if I switched over
and I was having
arguments like some bread or sandwiches
or something my fuel would run out fast
and then I have to reload
yes yeah have you ever done like a long fast
yeah I've
I mean the most I've done
long fast the most I've done is two days
oh really yeah I thought I was going to die
I did five to six days
once I think like five and a half days was the longest
I ever did only water
well I made this like lemonade
it was water
and maple syrup and lemon juice
and I would drink like
close to a gallon of it a day
why maple syrup that sounds like the Beyonce drink
um no it
maybe it's it might be similar
what was the name of it
there was a
I heard this guy Kelly Slater talking about it
and he was explaining exactly what he think
Kelly would have gotten it from
I know Kelly he would have gotten it from
I mean he's a surfer
I know Kelly Slater
I've met him a few times though
he probably would have gotten it from Beyonce
was there a bit of pepper in it as well
yes cayenne pepper
that's the Beyonce drink
yes
imagine that
well I drank the Beyonce drink for the whole week
and I felt better than I'd ever felt
like in my entire as on day
two three I felt miserable
but on like four or five and six
I felt
incredible like it was indescribable
how good I felt I was even able to go to the gym
I could play I could play like
an hour of full court basketball without getting cramps
I could do like three
times the amount of pull ups I normally did
I had like insane energy
you'd think that that's weird because of maple syrup
isn't it just pure sugar
right what was the point of having the maple syrup
yeah
it's because it was Beyonce's
no there was some sort of science behind it
like as your body's not getting any kind of
sugar that you need some sort
of sugar to help maintain
energy or something I don't know
I know but I think that's going to be a really great
thing to look at I'm going to definitely look that up
this episode of the podcast is brought to you by
better help what are some of the things
you want to keep the same about yourself
or your life in 2024
what part of your life are you already grateful for
or what is something that you're already proud of
around New Year's we all get obsessed
with how to change ourselves instead of just
expanding on things that we're already doing great
therapy helps you find your
strengths so you can ditch those extreme
resolutions and focus on minor changes
that can really stick for me it's
helpful to focus on wins or positive experiences
that I'm already grateful for and this isn't
just for people who have experienced trauma
or PTSD it's for everyone
this is a daily ritual I like to use to keep
my mind healthy and free of negative influences
if you're thinking of starting therapy

slash Danny Jones it's linked below
now back to the show
and Kelly was talking about that there's this plaque
that develops inside like people
that just never fast like over
your lifetime there's this plaque
that builds up inside of your gut
and like inside of your intestinal track
and then when you fast for a certain amount of time
like four or five days at
minimum that stuff starts
to like come out of your body
because when you have this plaque lining the inside
of your digestive track
when you're eating normal foods you're not
getting all the nutrients you need from those foods
yeah so by
expelling that from your body doing a five day fast
now after you
come back to eating you're going to
ingest some more of the nutrients and vitamins
that you get from your normal diet yeah that's
not unlike what
David Sinclair the longevity
scientist who's also Australian
says a lot even though
in the past few months he's been widely discredited
but you know when
he does speak
about this we know and Peter Otea does this as well
when you fast it basically
clears out all of the dead cells
that accumulate
over the time you know we've got
programmed cell death apoptosis
it just happens we know the cells die
right it just
just happens and they just sit there
and by going in
and fasting
you're
inducing autophagy you know basically going
in and cleaning up all of those dead cells
right but let me tell you I think
I do you know this is not my area
fasting is not my area
however I do
think that it works
even in a small period of time
like even if you're doing a 12 hour fast
overnight you know
18 hours you know I generally stop
eating at around 8 30
I'm not eating until
11 12 the next day
I just I'm not a morning eater
it's called what intermittent fasting
call it what you will I don't call it
anything it's just when I just naturally
eat yes
what I know for females though
who are trying to optimize for performance
I know that females actually work better
in a fed state when they exercise
it's got to do with
like hormones and you basically because
we also have something very different to men
which is a menstrual cycle
we do have to cater for that
and in the absence of
you know food and if your body
believes it's starving
it goes into this vital flight mode
and you may not ovulate
for a month or you may not
you know menstruate and I think that that's a
depending on where you are
and if you optimizing for kids
or not you have to be cautious of
fasting right right
and
I know like one thing with people who
indulge
in the ketogenic
or carnivore diet where they're reducing
carbs like one of the things that they have to deal
with is high cholesterol too
and
that's what happened to me when I did it was
I got my blood work done and my cholesterol
like my my general
practitioner
saw my cholesterol he was like bro
you need to do something you're like
stage 10 heart disease like you're gonna die
yeah and
you know I talked to Dom and I was showing it to him
and you know what Dom was basically saying was
like yeah you can get really high cholesterol from
this but like it all
it all boils down
to like the plaque in your arteries like if you
have high cholesterol LDL or whatever
it's not necessarily a bad thing
and there's he said there's a lot of athletes
like a lot of very like
like high performance
athletes that have
very high cholesterol
so let's just
you keep using the word cholesterol
right we have to understand that we've got
total cholesterol
we've got LDL
then we've got the HDL
I'm talking about LDL yeah
and that's another thing that's wrong with general
practitioners where they don't give
you the full story right
so this is what we know if you've got a
high what you want is
ratios again like I said to you at my practice
we're focusing on ratios and trends
I basically want to say to you
this is where you are right now but in 10 years
you're trending towards cardiovascular
disease I don't want to say that but
that's what we're trying to pick up on
whereas a doctor would just tell you you're fine now
and then you eventually go back in 10 years
they'd be like okay great statin
right it's like they're optimizing
for a statin
when it comes to LDL right think
of LDL right you have saturated fat
which is present in animal
based products and
dairy products as well
so you have your saturated fat and you
don't end up getting rid of it
when it breaks down
these eventually leaves
these little breadcrumbs if you will
these breadcrumbs are
your LDL right
your HDL
is basically the janitor
okay so your HDL comes in
and sweeps up all
of the LDLs and you get rid of it
that's why we have our HDL
that's the difference between LDL
so if LDL ends up building up
right and there's not enough HDL
that means that all of these little
breadcrumbs are everywhere
and there's not enough
janitors to go in and clean it up
now if you have a really
high LDL
right but you've got an even
higher HDL in the
ratio of 2 to 1
that's still okay
I think my HDL is like
40
which is like the low end of normal
yeah and so
again if that is 40
but your LDL is 150
then that's a problem
even we can even see
200s LDL
yeah
that's where the problem is
and you also want to look at
ApoB
which is
we really want to look at that
you're even at a one to one
that's even not sufficient enough
it's so funny because the guidelines
when you go to a doctor
the guidelines actually for LDL
just has to be less than 100
whereas if you really want to be optimised
it should be less than my books 80
and you want to be sitting at a 2 to 1
with your HDL
your LDL should be double what your HDL is
yes or
even another measure is getting
total triglycerides to HDL ratio
which should be a 3
to 1
so it's all about ratios
try to glyceride should be triple what your HDL is
yeah no more
so just think right you said you've got a 200
right if I said to you
okay great but then if you had
a 400 HDL
okay
look it's high
but it still means that you're at the correct ratios
right
however this is where things get tricky
like hundreds of studies
that show that a HDL over
80 is a risk factor for cancer
really yeah
so you want to be really maintaining that
and then when it comes to arterial health
once again right
if we are building up plaque
within the walls of the artery what are you doing
really you're narrowing the artery
so what does that do
blood flow
yeah it gets there slower
okay so we don't want that
and then eventually what happens if you just keep
if it just keeps lodging in the same place
that's what that happens and then it stops the blood flow
and that's an infarct or an embolism
you know how you have an embolism in your heart
we just call it a heart attack
embolism in your brain
it is called a stroke
embolism in your lung
same thing
that's weird
yeah cholesterol is something I just
really never understood
but cholesterol is good because the reason I wanted
to just get the Norman Clature right
is because we hear so much cholesterol is bad
it's like we've been around for how many
how many millions of years
cholesterol is a nut we need it
we actually need it to synthesize
testosterone
right you actually need it
for the synthesis of hormones
so cholesterol is not bad
however it becomes bad and troublesome
when your LDL is at a certain
place and we don't we really want to clean
those arteries out
it doesn't like aerobic exercise increases HDL
right
but there's
you know what it doesn't exercise increase HDL
increases HDL yeah
but it doesn't necessarily decrease LDL
correct that's why I was like oh I didn't know what you were going with that
so yeah unfortunately
but you know what it does do there is a really great relationship
you can actually
with better arterial health
from exercise there are studies that showing
the relationship between
you're better able to metabolize LDL
better right yeah and that's actually
probably my next task after
I put this myokine research
out there I'm probably going to look at the relationship between
LDL and exercise
because for me
I mean I don't eat terribly
I used to when I was a triathlete
I was 40 pounds lighter than what I am now
but I was training 45 hours a week
I have a great relationship
with I've got a great relationship
with LDL and I think it's because I've spent most
of my life exercising
and I still spend a lot of my time
doing something
right
and there's people that take like injectable
I know Peter Atea mentioned
that he takes some sort of like crazy injection
that like reduces your ApoB
or like people take it like once he
like you take a couple shots a year or whatever and it's supposed to like
it's the one thing
that can actually suppress
and down-regulate the ApoB
he's taking an injectable form of that
I thought he was taking a little statin
no he was saying that he
I forget the name of the drug
but I looked it up and it was like $15,000
for a year's worth of it and it was injectable
okay look
great because we actually want
if you could you know people are like
but watch it out ApoB
if you can get it to zero
it's the one thing that's useless right
like we use LDL but ApoB we don't have any use for
it's like one thing our body produces that just
hurts us
but if you bring down LDL
the thing that's scary
is the LP little A
yes I have a great LP little A
yeah me too which is great
because you only have to test that once in your life
and it never changes
and you've got
it's great because that's great for you and I
but you know when you used to hear like 5, 6 years ago
even 10 years ago
you'd hear about it to a difference
35 year old cyclist healthy
as just dropping dead from a heart attack
you know people never knew why
and now know that it could plausibly
be because of LP little A
really
don't you remember like 10
I remember back when I say 10 years ago
but it was around then
I did my last race in 2013
you know
I know that there's so many
athletes who were so fit and I was like
why on earth are they dying they're so healthy
yeah there's so many of them
like I mean there's not really so many
but like recently even like LeBron James's
had like a really like a lifting weights
had like a
some sort of a heart attack I don't know
but it's scary
like I don't know whether that was drug induced
by any way I don't know
nothing was released but that's a bit scary
I think he's 19 right
yeah he's super young and then there was
last year that guy that played
he played on defense for the Buffalo Bills
he just literally dropped dead in the middle
of the field and they had to cancel the game
he's still playing right now it's crazy
he's still able to come back
yeah his heart just like stopped beating
for a while
yeah that's terrifying
I don't think that that was an LDL
or I don't think that was a cholesterol problem though
a cholesterol problem
I don't think that was a cholesterol problem though
no people say it's
but you know you never know
they don't they they never he never
came out and like talked about it I think
there was an interview where they asked him like
what the his diagnosis was and he's like
you know what I want to know
why do you think
if all of this education is out there right
don't put education out I do
you've got great guests on here that put great education out
why do you think we still have an
obesity epidemic
or a Alzheimer's disease epidemic
that's a good question
if we now know
and like people like uberman too becoming
more and more popular and getting millions of views
on
three hour YouTube videos about vision
yeah I or cholesterol
I know it's hard to believe that
they're really I mean I don't
and it's I don't see a lot of
people in like my daily
circles like they're obese or overweight
I mean I could probably think of maybe like three
people I know that are like really overweight but
but yeah I don't know the answer I don't know
the answer to that let's look at sleep
because I think sleep is super important
as well sleep is
something that we spend a third of our lives doing
right and we know that
sleep deprivation
can increase your risk of all
cause mortality and yet a lot of us
are still sleep deprived why
it's it's I think that that's
really interesting
that is very interesting do you measure your sleep
I do measure my sleep I have one of your
or rings yeah I went on the way when I sleep
though um
rookie era but it uh I don't know there's a
weird placebo effect with my or ring
sometimes I'll wake up and it like
tells me I slept like shit and I feel great
all day yeah and then sometimes it tells me
I slept great best sleep I've ever gotten and I just
feel like dead all day yeah and that's
a there's an actual phenomenon for that
people who are getting stressed out over
their devices yes I suffer from that
yeah I've got clients who ring me
they're like oh my god Louise
am I my HRV is this like
what do I do it's like just listen to your
body you know
um what is HRV
and why is that important heart rate
variability so basically
it's we let's
look at at the nervous system right
the nervous system comprises of two branches
you've got the central nervous system which is
just the brain and the spinal cord
that is the hardware then
you've got the peripheral nervous system
peripheral nervous system is
the all of the nerves that come off of the
spinal cord right they come off the spinal
cord and then they go into our muscles
and all of our organs right and
these relay messages
from the brain
to the body and then also
you know the other way which is
we get messages that come up into
from the body up into the brain
so as part of this peripheral
nervous system branch
we've got an autonomic branch
and within that sits the sympathetic
and the parasympathetic branch of your nervous system
you've probably heard of it sympathetic
is the fight or flight
and the
parasympathetic is the rest and digest
so at any given time this is where we are
it's like a seesaw
is that what you call it in America a seesaw
yeah yeah
we're trying to maintain homeostasis
equilibrium right
if we get a bit stressed
we've activated the parasympathetic
the sympathetic nervous system
so we're in this this fight or flight
your body remember
stress means
you've got to run away from danger
your nervous system is still
additionally it's there to
fight off danger
that's what it was there for
so if there was a tiger coming
right or a lion
you'd have to activate the sympathetic nervous system
which means we're going to shut down
blood flow that goes to
places where it's not needed
and I want you to dilate your pupils
and I want you to run fast and run away from danger
that's what you're telling your brain
every time you get stressed so you activate
the sympathetic nervous system when you're stressed
in this you're not balanced right
that's when you're activating this
when you're even exercising
because your heart rate is
pounding so we're like this
then what we want to do is
we basically want to breathe a lot
to bring us back down into equilibrium
that's what we're always trying to do 24-7
we're trying to if we're asleep
we're like this the parasympathetic nervous system
is activated we wake up
because cortisol gets released
which is our stress hormone
we've got these two branches
to maintain a healthy
HRV
what heart rate variability is
it's basically measuring
the variation between
these two branches
so if you exercise
we know that our heart rate has gone up
but then if we also sleep
our heart rate has gone down
but then if we come up
basically HRV
so the higher the more variation
that you have between these two branches
the better therefore the higher
the HRV
if it doesn't have a lot of variation
HRV is low
interesting
so it does not want you to be
24 hours a day
it does not want you to be in the parasympathetic
zone
it does not want you to be in the sympathetic
zone it wants you to be
in both and it also wants
you to be able to
get into sympathetic
and then get out of sympathetic
it doesn't want you to stay in sympathetic for 10 hours
straight
so the reason why it's a good
predictor of
recovery and also health
is because it knows that you have
a smart nervous system
you know how to get into
sympathetic and then when you're in sympathetic
you know how to get out of that
sympathetic zone and activate the parasympathetic
zone
so it's basically
the way it's measured
is the gap between heart beats
so you don't want the same
amount of time between each heart beat
you want a little bit of a different time between heart beat
so if you have a low HRV
what would be the best
way to improve it but just by exercising
and sleeping well can you actually
improve it or do you have some sort of genetic
ceiling
look everybody
is individual
my average HRV
is about 180
that's my average
I got a high HRV
but now I've been travelling this morning
my HRV was
98 which is like me
that's like dead zone for me that means it's like
I'm critical
I remember I got really
sick I got the flu
I think about 6 weeks ago
HRV went down to like
52 and I thought okay well this is
my last I'm on my last leg today
oh my god I don't want to tell you what
my HRV is
but it's everybody it's
your HRV is for you and mine is for me
however you can
increase it you can increase it by 10
points like to your average what's your average
my average is like 45
wow okay yeah if I
drink if I get drunk
at dinner and I go to sleep
and I wake up the next morning
my HRV will be
20's
especially if you have wine
your wine is terrible
the best HRV I've ever had is like in the 60's
sleeping
you can do this what I've seen because
we do this with our clients
you've got to be on a good streak
you've got to raise it you can't just have
a good HRV for 4 days
and then just plummet it
you can raise your HRV
by becoming
fitter, cardiovascular
so remember
that cardiac remodeling so you can get
stronger ventricles but also
I know that sleep really increases
HRV because it's a measure of recovery
right so if you get
your resting heart rate down
which should generally be below
50
resting heart rate should be below 50
you'll be on the track to getting a better HRV
mainly so if I'm not sick but mainly
it's around 48
47 yeah
so people
in their 30's or 40's
if they have a resting heart rate of
60 is that necessarily
always bad to have a
kind of a raised resting heart rate
it's always bad
it's not always bad but if it's constantly
that way we want to look at measures
of bringing it down which is again
basically it's basically
saying that at rest
your heart has to work really hard
to pump the blood out
that's what it's just saying
so the reason why when
you're rested your heart
shouldn't have to work that hard
to pump
blood it shouldn't have to work that hard
if it is working hard
at a rest because you're not using it you're not
running so you don't need the excess
you're just at rest
your brain isn't really I mean your brain's working
but it's shut down your senses are shut down
looking at anything so you don't need
that much blood flow
but therefore your heart
rate shouldn't be at rest shouldn't be high
we want to bring it down
we want to try and have it below 50
below 50 no matter what
and then if you see some sort of like
intermittent spike up in the
60's like what would you estimate the
cause of that would be stress
like if it goes up to like 10 beats per
minute say yeah it and it's
happening at night it definitely like
stressed or sick mind does
even if I go to bed
so my favorite hours
for my body to sleep is 10 a.m.
10 p.m. till 6 p.m.
so if I sleep at
midnight my resting
heart rate is going to be shot really
interesting
and you can test this with you know different
types of supplements as well
like to calm down your mind
you may want to take GABA
Gama Aminobriteric Acid
started taking a magnesium
L3N8 a couple months ago
love
but also
I mean I love it I take it too and I feel like
it really helps me get into deep sleep however
the research still isn't there
on the absolute
effectiveness of
L3N8 and sleep
even though no
I mean we still don't know if it
can truly penetrate the central nervous
system which is what the big selling point is
how it can get into the blood brain barrier
and help calm you down
and put you into more of a deep sleep zone
it's still very
early we've just got minor studies there
when it comes to
supplements that you
like to research
or when you are working with athletes
and stuff like what are some of the
the main supplements that these people are using
to enhance their brain
or their processing power
well first of all
we do a blood test
and we see that they are deficient in something
remember everything has a chemical pathway
if they are vitamin D deficient
we need to investigate that
let's just say we have plugged
the holes and they are not deficient
in anything which has never happened
zinc everything
where to from there
well I think that
every single person I don't care what age you are
I really don't
I don't care what pathology you have
you should be taking creatine
really? Creatine monohydrate
is the most widely studied supplement
it is the cheapest and most
safe supplement on the market
I've interviewed some of the best people
that are world renowned for creatine
who have done their PhDs in creatine
they all say that you can get
creatine from dietary
sources such as meat, liver, eggs
you know we know that
but we also know that
it's not as bio available
because of just the way we are living
right?
so we should be supplementing with it
and starting at 5 grams per day
of creatine monohydrate
that's one of the big things Dom got me into as well
is taking creatine monohydrate every day
without a doubt
I've got my parents on it
you kids can have it
really?
the PhD
Darren told me that there is
no cut off with kids
if you are over the age of 45
you should be having it
my parents or my dad is 72
and my mum is 69
I've got them having it
I had to convince them they thought it was drugs to start with
I said it's not drugs
why is it the cheapest stuff is always the best for you?
because it just is
it's the most widely studied
so what specifically does it do?
how does it help?
so first of all it's a naturally occurring molecule
we already have it in our body
we don't produce enough of it
it helps with ATP
regeneration
so ATP
is the fuel source
the source of energy production
in all of our cells
we have it in the brain
so we need ATP
to create energy
to produce anything
just to even be awake
so when we take creatine
it can help
produce ATP
it helps with cell energy metabolism
so it can actually
help with so many disorders as well
if you're anxious
it can help you with that
if you want to produce more neuronal energy
it can help you with that
my father he had a stroke
a few years ago
and I've got him taking it just to help with better
neuron energy in his brain
it can actually help be neuroprotective
against
against concussions
it can help be neuroprotective
against Parkinson's disease
there's so much research happening now
in the neurodegenerative state phase
and just today actually
I put up on my story on Instagram
a really great study that came out
to show the effectiveness of creatine monohydrate
on Alzheimer's disease patients
because Alzheimer's disease patients
can't produce
energy in certain areas of their brain
really?
they're brain now is full of
you know, plaques
and tangles and these towel proteins
and they're built up and they're blocking
certain areas of the brain so
you can give them creatine
5 grams a day
how much is that like a spoonful?
generally they're coming in a spoon
and you just drink it in water?
you can have it however you want
you can have it in yogurt if it's got no taste
you can go up from there
and have 10 grams if you will
and I mean you don't want to have 100 grams
there is no science
or evidence that shows that it can actually
cause hair loss which I know
people are really scared about that
or that it can cause kidney damage
why would people think it causes hair loss?
just because of the DHT
pathway
androgens?
yeah
because it increases testosterone doesn't it?
yeah
so
there is no hair loss
there is no kidney damage
there's been so many studies
there was actually one great study on
bone density and women
and they tracked them for 2 years
and they got them taking
I think 7.5 grams of creatine
every single day for 2 years
there was no stopping, there was no cycling
there was no loading
they increased bone density right
but they also said in the study
there was no heart defects
there was no kidney damage
there was no liver damage
there was no hair loss
these are women taking it for 2 years
so
these are just myths that are out there
that's fascinating
creatine that's the first one
second one is EPA DHA
which is omega 3 fatty acids
say that again slower
omega 3 fatty acids
okay EPA DHA
so omega 3 fatty acids
contain 3 parts
there's ALA
there's EPA
and then there's DHA
the brain is fat
and water, it's around 60% fat
40% water
that's what your brain is made of
in that fat zone
in the 60% fat zone
around 30%
20-30% is DHA
really?
yeah so brain tissue is abundant
in DHA fat
I could imagine that a lot of people are deficient in that
yeah so you can actually
they did this
great all cause mortality
risk factors
paper they brought it out like 3 years ago
and basically they listed
the new list of
risk factors that lead to death
hypertension
chronically high blood pressure
smoking is a risk factor
they then put in
in
low omega 3 index
so we now have
if you've got a low omega 3 index
which is a measure
of omega 3s in the red blood cell
a low omega 3 index
of 4% or less which is what the majority
of the US population has
is a risk factor
for all cause mortality
so you want to be on that scale
you want to be on 8% or more
I don't think I've ever had that specific
that
like my EPA or DHA measured
in a blood test before
you can do it it's called the omega 3 index
but like looking at how abysmal my cholesterol is
I eat a ton of fish by the way
and I also take EPA
I take fish oil supplements
and you may very well be up there
even though you're eating a ton of fish
we are in America
so it's not sometimes the best
source of getting EPA DHA
American fish
well farmed fish
most of it's farmed that's why
well I live in Florida most of my fish is caught
right off the beach here
you're doing it?
no but all my friends do
some of us who live in New York
we're going to Whole Foods
what about canned fish
that's not as good
I know Dom eats a lot of canned
I know he eats a lot of canned
mackerel and canned sardines
you can get a lot of the EPA DHA
then you've got to worry about the mercury content
but that's fine
that's the mercury reason like the big
pelagic fish like tuna
correct
so you want to be making sure that you're getting
a really great dose of EPA DHA
we also know that we're now getting studies
again to Alzheimer's disease
so amyloid beta which is the hallmark
of Alzheimer's disease
these amyloid beta
causes these plaques to build up
and basically clump together
like this
we are now getting early studies
in humans to show that
omega-3 fatty acids, EPA DHA
at around 5 grams a day
can go through and amyloid
these plaques so we're now even seeing
the effectiveness of
EPA DHA
on the brain of Alzheimer's
can reverse it?
no not reverse it basically
amyloid some of the plaques
break them down it better
okay
like metabolize them better
that's fascinating
and you've got to think we've got
our cells need to be moving around
we've got trillions of cells in the body
we've got around 87 billion neurons in the brain
and you want them to be able to be fluid
and move around and that's what EPA DHA
does as well it helps with cell membrane fluidity
the outer shell of the cell
to be more fluid
I think I'll go to my grave
telling people to take creatine and EPA DHA
that's awesome
what about nicotine
so let me give you a background on this
I had this guy in here who is a
he's a brain scientist
who he does
these studies on psychoactive drugs
and the brain he's based in the UK
he came in here
and he had these little nicotine pouches
he was putting in his lip
and he's like how the Japanese are writing on it
and he's like it's nicotine pouches
I'm like really you do that and you're a brain doctor
or scientist and he's like yeah it's neuro-protective
he's like it fights against all timers
and all this stuff
and he's like makes you more sharp
when you're talking and all this stuff
and then I started buying it I got these little zinc cans
and now I'm like addicted to them
so I'm like worried if there's any downside to this
apart from addiction
I mean I know it increases focus
I have good
I can control myself
I have discipline so I can only do like a couple of them a day
but I know like
a lot of people do like a lot of that
like a ton of it
and they mix it with vaping and stuff like that
but are there any
downsides to nicotine
without the inhalation of like
vape like people chewing gum
or using the pouches or anything like that
downsides I mean it's again
it's not my field I've actually never personally taken it
but there's so many people taking it
I know that even Andrew has spoken about this
and I think Peter Atea
has spoken about this as well
about taking nicotine
to help with focus
and vigilance throughout the day
I heard there was a guy who won like a Nobel Prize
and he was like studying for his research
he would chew nicotine gum all the time
really?
some guy at Stanford
you know what I think it's doing
I think it's again
there is
no point in doing any of these things
unless you've got the three
pillars of health downpack unless you're sleeping well
restorative sleep unless you're exercising
appropriately
and unless you are getting the right
macronutrients and micronutrients
there's just
no point in taking any of these things
you've got to get your
you've got to get your things in order
first and everything else is an accessory
that's what I call it cold water immersion
I'll be it I've got to
plunge in my apartment
it is just an accessory
I can't cold plunge my weight out of bad dieting
right right right
you know
is there any neuroprotective things that you're aware of
when it comes to nicotine?
no but that's just me not being yeah
because it's not my line
it could maybe there could be early research
on neuroprotection using nicotine
I mean I would
I would need a lot of evidence to show
that that is neuroprotective
and is it
do you know about
any sort of effects with nicotine
on like the heart and the arteries
no I heard it's vasoconstrictive
constricture
well why would that be a good thing
no it wouldn't be a good thing
yeah exactly
definitely wouldn't be a good thing but I wonder if it's like
does it only do that when you are taking it
or does it does that go is there like
does it fade away
or does it stay there forever yeah I mean
I don't think it would stay there forever
because you're you know
there'd be vasodilation
you know after that however
I think if it's if it is causing
that then what's the point like why are you having it
why am I taking it
just because someone said that it's great
I like it and I like tried it once I'm like this is nice
I feel like I feel great I'm energized
and then you sound like the rest of the population
on Instagram who are like oh this person
said this works so I'm gonna take this
and it ends up being detrimental to their health
yeah there's lots of like Instagram people too
who like make funny videos about taking
zins and they'll like pack them
pack their lips full of them
and like it's become like this trend
wow you can just buy that
you can just buy that off the counter like where
as long as you're 18 any gas station
great do you heard of a guy called freezer tarps
no oh my god you gotta look him up
he's on Instagram he actually lives in Tampa
and he is like he's a
what would you call him he's a
nicotine pouch influencer
he's got millions of followers
okay because I guess it's like this
it's I guess there's a good
the good side of it is that it's like
helping kids get away from the vaping stuff
so now they're doing this I think this is
probably better than inhaling all those
vape chemicals
but it's uh it's it's wild to see
it take off in like
all the young people yeah
obsessed with it right now I think like
when it comes to having anything
exogenous it's like where are you getting your
information from first and foremost and do you know
how these
compounds and molecules right
it takes a lot of time to study this
and what it actually does in the human body
I wouldn't take somebody on Instagram
and just um you know think it's good for you
let's for example for arguments like
let's just talk about vitamin D
okay 40%
by the way Steve find a video of freezer
tarps for your shower
vitamin D you know most of the US
population is I think
I think 40% is vitamin
D deficient right right
it could be more
vitamin D is a
it's a hormone right it's a both
vitamin and a hormone but what happens
is okay because I just had a
I just was looking at blood work before
I came here of one of our clients
low vitamin D right I was looking at his report
he had a really low vitamin D which is around
20 nanocrones per deciliter
right and we want it to be up at around
50 or 60
what happens is most
people get a vitamin D score and they'll be like
okay I want to go through and I want to take
5000 I use a vitamin D
my doctor told me I had low vitamin D
so I've got to go and take vitamin D tablets
most people are just taking it without knowing their
true measurements right but what we
don't realize is that in the
body you have to ask your body every time you
get any type of score you have to ask your body
why did my body think it was a good idea
to lower vitamin D right
and if you look at what happens
in the body if you know your cellular biology
we know that vitamin D actually gets lowered
in the presence of
lead or in heavy metal so if you
got heavy metal or lead in your system
vitamin D because vitamin D
binds to lead right
but we don't want the body smart it's like
we don't want this lead so let's lower
vitamin D in the body
until we excrete this lead
so what happens is if you've got low vitamin
D and you have lead in your system
but you don't know about that you go and take
a bolus of you know the sun pretty
much you go and take 5000 I use a
vitamin D so you're bringing up your vitamin D levels
in your body but also bringing up the lead
so you have to be really careful
with just taking supplements
just because they're over the counter
they are there for a reason like they
are present
they are micronutrients in the body
they are hormones that you are ingesting
and you don't know what it's doing unless you have
a really really smart
practitioner and you're not supposed to take
vitamin D without K2 right
I mean it's not supposed to
it just helps with the absorption but yeah
I mean I take a vitamin D supplement
every day I don't have high lead
but I do have low vitamin D
I swear it's because I live in New York
I thought because when I got my blood work done
I had like off the charts vitamin D
what was it?
I could pull it up
I was like
but like so I was taking
I was just like
taking vitamin D supplements every day
just because I thought it was good
because I didn't want to get sick
and I have two kids
that are always like getting cold
from school and bringing it home and I was just trying
to like keep myself from catching anything
and I was like oh you know everyone says vitamin D is great
I should supplement it with it every day
so I was taking vitamin D with K2
and I got my blood work done
my vitamin D was like
through the roof like what are you doing
but I don't think it was ever
I don't think it was ever low
so like
do you think there's
I mean it's fine
it probably wouldn't be like
if it was over 100 maybe
it's like crazy
do you think there's any negative effect
of having too high of vitamin D?
probably
I mean
I know there's no cut off limits
to my knowledge but I don't think that it's like
I don't think it'd be necessarily good to have something
like maybe over 200
right
now take me forever to go through it
but no yeah it was like it showed the reference
range and mine was like in like above
like in the red
okay for too high and you stopped taking it?
well I started taking it like now I take it
like every couple days instead of every day
okay good and you know blood work is really easy
you can check it we have a turnover
of red blood cells every 120 days
you like basically getting you
a batch of red blood cells so you can
check it
and every time I get my blood work there's like
either my liver
or my kidney
or my white blood cell count
there's always something that's off
do you find the video freezer tarps?
white blood cell count could also be
in the presence of an infection
that's the guy right there short right there
alright so let's see what we got here
go to the one below that
where he has the hat on and the crazy face
when coach makes the fella's condition
so yeah he makes these like goofy videos
like golfing and like working out
and stuff like that and just like joking
about the nicotine
he's funny he lives around here
but he's got tons of followers and all he talks about
is fucking nicotine pouches
that's yeah that's I mean I don't understand
this whole follower generation it's like
well it's because all the young people
now like in their early
20s I know like my young cousins
and like friends I know
they're all a ton of them
are on those vapes
like the jewels or the little vape stick things
that's so freaking scary
that stuff's gotta be really bad
for you but like
the fact that this stuff is becoming
popular there's gotta be a correlation
there I mean
I don't know it's I think I'm just
seeing like the craziest shit on
Instagram going viral for no reason
things that don't even matter I actually
just put up a I just debunked
some guy on Instagram
he's now part of the health crew and
he's saying like you know he's
selling this protocol
which says you know I can increase your life
okay your life expectancy
if you buy my $150,000
protocol within this protocol
sits a PMF
P-E-M-F PEMAT
which is a you know these
electromagnetic pulses that just you know
you can sleep on and it just basically
mimics you being out on the grass
it's a
red light therapy bed like just the most
ridiculous things and what upsets me is that
so many people follow him and so many
people are buying these things and it's
vulnerable people who believe
that they're going to increase their life
expectancy or increase
their lifespan by doing
these heroic things
by just instead of doing the basic things
and I question humanity and psychology
it's like why not just exercise
right exercise will far
outweigh any PEMF mat
if that's what it's called. I'm gonna make money for mattress eyes you gotta sell something
you gotta sell supplements
you know liver king right? I mean
he became like the most popular thing on the internet
when it came to like in like the health community
for a long time and he was saying that oh I get
these muscles from you know walking outside
barefoot getting the sunlight eating testicles
eating liver and testicles right and then
everyone found out that he was on steroids
and he was taking like crazy amounts of
steroids and and um
peptides and HGH like
he was spending $30,000
a month on all the stuff he was taking
yeah I saw a video of him a week ago
actually and he had
um you know he was wearing these little
patches that stimulate your muscles right
we used to use them in training um triathlon
if like we're on a um a long haul
flight or if we had you know broken
our ankle or something like that just so we wouldn't lose
any muscle mass and he had it on his
chest but let me tell you he looked
so bad it was as if he
was dying I really yeah it was
I've got to send it to you he looked so bad I thought
maybe you can find that Steve um
yeah liver king's
yeah he looked like
this video of him he
was a look like okay
and somebody actually shared it saying he's not
going to be with us for much longer guys
yeah
he looks odd he's
like super he's like super
red looking like he's got this like
there you go there's the video
the fourth one to the right yeah that's it
the Daily Mail yeah
yeah he looks like he's dying can you play the video
yeah it's got to be on this
after his yeah
his health is being questioned that's just an
ad but look there it is
he's very unnatural looking
he looks like he's dying right
yeah he doesn't look healthy
oh after after this uh these this
but how much how how many
people are following him didn't he make a hundred
million dollars oh yeah selling
I don't his ancestral
diet yeah he sells the liver
supplements which
like look at him look at his
face
yeah he looks rough
I don't know what he's talking about his veins are
like garden hoses in his arms
I'm also looking at his face
yeah his face looks weathered
but like that you know that's
the thing with this
kind of stuff like this guy's he's clearly
a charlatan that's
you know promoting
some sort of supplement he's using
to make money and he's
not telling the truth on how he gets that
physique or how he gets those big muscles because he's
injecting insane amounts of steroids
but at the same time he's also
he he's also talking about like
the good stuff like exercise
eat organ meats which are
good for you get outside in the sunlight do
all this stuff so he's promoting like a healthy lifestyle
but at the same time he's also
like he's just throwing in this little white
lie in there that's just misleading people and people
get really mad about that how many people are doing
that what I mean I think
right now it's rampant on
Instagram and social media this whole
notion of people selling products
and not really knowing what they're doing this
you know one particular man who
I I know works
you know with I think he worked with Donna
White what I don't know even if he's been
to college or anything but you know he's promoting
this lifestyle that it's he just
says the craziest things like
he actually said that the brain is
a non metabolic organ
who is this
his name is Gary Brecker
Gary Brecker yeah it's
he was actually just on Joe Rogan this
week which is what yeah it's upset
a lot of people
and so he is
so he helped Donna White
but he's actually got a business
with
this dude
yeah oh I've seen this guy
all over Instagram and YouTube
so this is the guy
okay so Dana White was really unhealthy
for a long time and then this guy
apparently started working with Dana and like
changed his diet gave him a bunch of stuff
to take and like figured out something
within his DNA he talks about some sort of DNA
methylation and it's it's it is
it is so insane
because it's like he put
Dana White on a one hundred and
fifty thousand dollar protocol and I'm
telling you you can put anyone on that damn
protocol and they will get
they will get benefits from it
he's not doing anything
outrageous
like he didn't give him any type
of magic pill
or cure and by the way
if you listen to what he says
he's been dean bunked by scientists
by physicians
it is the things that he
says are so outrageous that's the thing
you can get some people that it's like okay maybe that was an
honest mistake can you find his website
he says the great yeah we can look at his
protocol let's see like what his main the
main thing he's saying is there you go
I don't like giving him any airtime
so he works with Grant Cardone
again oh no
stop it Grant actually
he's the grifter king
so Grant and him own
Tannex Health and that's how he's become famous
you know Grant comes to
this town all that like every
month because the church of Scientology
is right down the street from here he's a Scientologist
oh yeah he's one of the biggest
Scientologists yes
I didn't know that
it's funny because he's married to a Greek woman
is it really yeah Helena
is um is Greek
and I would think that she would that's Grant's wife
yeah I would think that she would get him to
a Greek Orthodox church so scroll up to the
top what is it
okay scroll down a little bit
da da da da da da da no no Gary Brecker
is a professional human biologist and co-founder
Tannex Health
holy shit yeah
as a human biologist and co-founder
of Tannex Health Gary does more
than just guide the company's
global wellness vision and direction
with more than 20 years of bio
hacking and functional medicine experience
he is obsessed with the function
and performance of the human body and finding
innovative ways to help people achieve
absolute
wow
yeah it's ridiculous that's
a major red flag that he works with
Grant Cardone
so
so what is he saying like what is he
doing that is
so cutting edge no it's nothing
he's not doing anything he's doing a basic
methylation tester for example
um in order for you once you
ingest vitamins okay
ingest food they get
broken down
methylated right and then we're
able to use them for different things
now if you have
certain genes
that don't allow you to methylate
certain vitamins it's going to
be detrimental okay
so if you have this one gene
polymorphism in the
gene called MT
HFR they call it
you know they call it a certain type of
gene have you heard of it they call it the mother fucker gene
the mother fucker gene yeah okay
so if you have that
it means that you cannot
methylate break down
certain types of B vitamins
okay we need we need B vitamins
for brain health for cardiovascular
health but what happens is if you can't break those down
what you'll see in your blood test is you'll see
a high homocysteine
right and high homocysteine is
a risk factor for
cardiovascular disease and
for dementia we don't want it we want
to bring cut we want to bring homocysteine down
so if you so if you have
this MT HFR
gene it won't allow you to methylate
B vitamins and if you can't get B vitamins
in your system okay you can't uptake
these B vitamins your
homocysteine will rise and a lot of other
complications happen
so if you find that out okay
that's great a lot of people have that gene
right so you can go through
and give them methylated B
vitamins right you can
we know how to do this it's standard
practice so he's going out
and selling this cure
for disease
and this is his protocol
$7000 10x pro plunge
but if you go down to get the whole thing I think it ends up
being like 150k
stop it
scroll down see what else he's got
you have to go down I think you have to go
he's got red lights he's got sauna 10x sauna
yeah you have to go on his actual 10x website
10 there there go visit the partner
click on that so
yeah come down he'll give you the there it is
holy crap was that a
tanning bed or is that a red light
bed that is a red light bed
look at this human protocol
is $102,936
and he's got his own red lights
super human protocol with red light panels
$15,000
absolute junk and
ridiculous that's more like a juve
he is selling
dreams he's
selling dreams to vulnerable people
and making so much
money on that I mean the markup on that
who needs a red light bed
accessories
these are accessories
people in Africa
who have two April E4 jeans
are living a long life
they don't have these beds they're spending time
out in nature in sunlight
they're exercising
they're not eating demolished foods
and let me tell you guys whoever is
buying into him is just making him
richer
he's got like this it's just
I mean who the fuck is paying $132,000
for a red light bed
if you're spending that much money it probably doesn't mean that much to you honestly
but this is what I mean but if you
have that much money to spend on that
anyone can push the needle
for you in terms of health
right
this is it's just bogus
like this is just accessories
I can't say that word enough
and he's selling a methylation test
that he's like whoop-de-doo
it's like any freaking practitioner
can do
most practitioners do
do methylation tests it's not a
I mean we do it in our practice
it's not a
it's not some sort of like
wow
it's nothing to write home about
anybody who has like a crazy paywall
to like learn all the secrets of
you have to be very skeptical
of that but I do know that if it wasn't for
Grant Cardone he probably wouldn't be where he is today
yeah
Grant Cardone's a whole another rabbit hole
we could dive down but
we don't have time to do that today
he's one of like the biggest
Scientologists and he's always here
like in Clearwater he's always on his
Instagram like filming himself being like right down the street
from here going to the
the big church with the gold
plated church of Scientology
and he's a wild character
yeah
so stick to the basics which is sleep
sleep
exercise and nutrients we actually didn't get into sleep
we did it
we didn't get into the just the
I think one of the best things
to touch on is the what happens during
deep sleep oh okay
yeah so you track your sleep you see slow
we're sleep so we've got like an hour of deep sleep
at night yeah we've got stage one
sleep that's when you're falling asleep
we've got stage two that's when you're in light sleep
we've got stage three it's called
non REM sleep that's
that's deep sleep
deep sleep is so important for two reasons
one we get the release
of growth hormone
growth hormone is where we get
responsible for protein synthesis for example
okay muscle regeneration
and we get
testosterone released
during that time frame as well but we also
get something really fantastic in the brain
called the glymphatic system
so the glymphatic system is like
the lymphatic
yeah so if you heard of the lymphatic system
in the body it's the same in your brain
so it's actually like a
sewage system so what happens
in the brain we've got all these little
brain cells right I said we've got
87 billion neurons we've got a certain
specialized brain cell called
the glial cell it comes from the
Greek word glue basically they
stick between the
the other neurons
and they hold them they stick between these two neurons
during deep slow wave
sleep what happens is they shrink
in size so these glial
cells get smaller and
your brain has cerebral spinal fluid
right and the cerebral
spinal fluid washes all through
the brain and it washes out the toxins
and debris one
of the debris that it washes
out is amyloid beta
which is the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease
so you are in deep sleep you activate
the lymphatic system
which acts as a sewage system
and a waste removal system for all
of the dead products in your brain
and then you wake up and you feel fresh
and if you do this over and over
and over again you can keep clearing
out these toxins if you keep sleep
depriving yourself and you don't get into deep
sleep what's going to happen
all of these little toxins are going to keep
building up building up building up
just like compound interest
they build up they accumulate
and then they rot your brain
to an extent
that's the link between sleep
and Alzheimer's disease
this is why it's super important to be optimizing
for deep sleep
then we're talking about circadian rhythm
making sure the screens
and the phones are really important
when I'm laying in bed
an hour before I go to bed I turn on my red lights
and bounce them off the wall and fill my whole bedroom
with red light
that's supposed to cut down the blue light
but I don't know if it helps
but I feel like it helps
it's interesting because
sleep can be completely destroyed
with one glass of wine
and we know that
but you know what I'm actually getting into now
spreading the information
about wine literally
killing you
when I say that let me not
get to ahead of alcohol
I should say alcohol is really
so what happens when you ingest
ethanol ends up
breaking down into acetyl aldehyde
and acetyl aldehyde is literally
poison it will kill
cells
so we also need to have a conversation
about what
is alcohol doing to you
we know that it already increases
your risk of breast cancer
in females especially
but it's also killing off
your brain cells
we've seen numerous studies
a biobank study that showed
over 35,000 brains
that got tested in relation to alcohol
and they found that
people ingesting moderate drinkers
which were 7 drinks a week
on average for women
and 14 drinks on average a week for men
what they found is that
the alcohol actually destroys
the grain matter of the brain
which is where the cell bodies of the neurons are
and it interferes with the white
matter of the brain which is where
the information processing speed happens
really
so
when I'm thinking about this I think about
most people who are young
like party and drink a lot
so what if they get older and they stop doing that
is it too late
it's never too late you can't reverse anything
but just keep in mind that
your brain is still
forming until around 25
to 30
so
because I do love wine
but I limit I do
two glasses a month
really strictly
if that
it's discipline
but when you really understand the science behind it
it's like why would I want to do that to my body
I really started paying attention to it once I started
tracking my sleep with the aura ring
once I saw how fucked my sleep got when I drank
that's really what
made me cut it back
and it's not just messing up your sleep
it's messing up your sleep
which is bad for you
but it's also killing cells
in your body and it's also increasing your risk
of breast cancer
and not just that
it's also down regulating
so many different genes
and up regulating other genes that are not good for you
right
have you ever heard of a lady named
Shauna Swan
I had her in here a few months ago
she is an endocrinologist
who wrote a book called Countdown
and she basically
conducted all these studies
like 10 year long studies
of
testosterone level
and sperm counts in men
across the country
and basically what she determined
is that sperm count
is going down by like
2% per year in males
in the US
between like the early 90s
up until now
the early 90s up until like 2005
and from 2005
that's when it was 1%
but now in the last 10 years it's been like up to 2%
that combined
with testosterone levels have been going down in men
so she was saying that
your average 30 year old now
will have
50% the testosterone that a 30 year old
would have had in the 50s
and she said that it all has to do with
pesticides
the phthalates that are in like the plastics
like plastic water bottles
endocrine disruptors
endocrine disruptors yeah
that scared the shit out of me
well we do have a nationwide
deficiency which is
I think it's classified as
350
or less yeah
let me tell you I am testing
absolutely every single person that comes to our practice
it's standard for us
many of the men are around
and we've had one that comes in at 250
it's insane
yeah and how
that is I think like hormone levels
or something people don't really think about a lot
but the hormone levels have
they regulate so many other
things in the body and they're like
that's been responsible for heart health
brain health everything
absolutely and like you know you need
there's also precursors
to hormones so we've got DHEA
they call this the
hormone of youth because it's really high
and you know in adolescents
and young adults and then it dissipates as we get older
and we need this
for the synthesis of
testosterone and
DHEA is surprisingly
if that is low it's also correlated
with REM sleep
REM sleep is also going to be very low
really yeah it's funny
I had a patient who had
really low DHEA
we started supplementing with
with DHEA and she's like
Louisa my REM sleep has
increased
I was like that's insane and that's when I started
she didn't even know about the study
she was taking DHEA
I thought that was something only men took
no gosh no
no DHEA is like
it helps create
hormones oh really all hormones
estrogen and testosterone it can yeah
I thought it was just specifically for testosterone
so
these guys who are getting like these
it's funny because you see
so many fertility problems
a lot
and it can be attributed
to low testosterone as well
yeah and the direct correlation
between that and sperm count
and the population decline
the growth in population is crazy
scary to think about
and how you would even go about reversing
something like that in the world we live in
when everything is just about making stuff cheaper
making more profit off of consumer products
I've got cousins who are still in Cyprus
right I've got a lot of family who still live there
in Cyprus I don't know if you've ever been
if you know too much about it it's a little island
of Greece um
I've heard great things
it is absolutely gorgeous everything is fresh
right everything they just catch it
no one over there my cousins
I've got a cousin who is 43
turning 44 and she's
pregnant and she's
and it's you know so many women
here in the US it's like 43 44
you wouldn't hear of them falling pregnant they're just over
they're just you know falling pregnant and that's late
to get pregnant right
I mean yeah apparently yeah
so um and but she just naturally just fell
pregnant there's no there's no problems over there
really yeah that's interesting
yeah because another thing that she mentioned in that book
was um she said I don't know
if she correlated with other countries but
I think it was in America she said that
once a woman passes
the age of 35
I think that the percentage
chance of
her giving birth to
someone with the um
the chromosome what is it the
21 Down syndrome chromosome
or whatever 21 yeah it goes
up by like 80% after
the age of 35 which is
which is crazy yeah that was in her book
I mean I'm not sure I know a lot of people
who are having like pretty healthy
pregnancies yeah yeah yeah it's
becoming a more popular thing to happen later
especially with like people focusing more
on like I mean nowadays people
they're not getting
pregnant as young as they used to
generally I think people are
especially women have like
careers and make more money than men
you know what I mean like in the relationship so they're not
gonna be like they don't want to be raising children
or whatever until they get older and they realize
some of them that I know
they like the biological clock tells
them like oh it's time for me to have a baby
but um
I think I'm finding what I see is that so many
women now are having children around 38
39 really yeah
yeah I mean I live in New York so it's a bit different
yeah New York's way different yeah
I know concussions are big in
lots of sports but do you deal with people
like that yeah I actually I know
CTE is a crazy thing yeah which
can't be diagnosed as until
until they're dead until they're dead yeah I was
gonna use a nicer word
concussions are huge I think
we're not that's another thing that we're
you know missing the
I'm against the NFL I stopped working
with NFL players really yeah
specifically because I was doing so many brain scans
on them that was actually my first sport
and I was just seeing so many dysfunctions
I'm like listen you've like you
need to stop you need a son they just
couldn't they like I can't they like I've
I feed my family I feed
you know 10 people that I'm taking care of
I can't just stop I'm like well it's just
unethical of me to give you
anything else other than telling you to stop
I know so many people who are just
getting their head bashed in
okay and then they're not
properly recovering from it
to recover from a trauma like that
you would need to heal your brain
for a very long time it doesn't take a week
and I know that these concussion protocols are
just not in line with player health
and safety I know
that concussions
multiple concussions can really damage
the endocrine system and I know there's been
studies that showed like people like fighters
NFL players their hormone levels
crash after multiple concussions
it can cause everything from
depressive like symptoms
to early cognitive impairment
psychosis
even worse chronic traumatic encephalopathy
how many players do you know that have
actually committed suicide and you find out
you cut their brains up it's like well they actually had
CTE which is
repeated hits to the head right
which end up in neuronal death
and it mimics the brain
of an Alzheimer's disease patients because you see these
big clumps
you know and their brain is just
I just
don't know why you would voluntarily put your kid
especially a kid whose brain
is still forming into a sport
where you're actually hitting them
hitting their heads with each other
yeah it's a violent sport
hasn't there been
some stuff done
on treatment of that with like
hyperbaric oxygen chambers
yeah so what HBOT does
it you know 100% oxygen
it helps the healing process which is great
um A
it depends on when you actually
got the trauma to your head
because once you get to the trauma right you've got this
24 hour to 72 hour
window to really make a difference
and there's been
many people who are actually
experimenting with ketones post
traumatic insults like within the first 72
hours just feeding yeah feeding the
brain ketones ketones ketones so
they can heal faster they're getting them
in hyperbaric oxygen chambers to get the
most amount of oxygen to be delivered to the
brain they're doing things such as
cooling the brain to cool it down
from injury so they're putting
their heads in buckets of ice
and putting a um
putting a snorkel coming out of their head
just to cool it down putting um
ice on their neck to try
and really cool down the brain
and heal it and recover it faster however
it's just
it's like I understand
the sport and I know it brings so much
happiness to the lives of many
the Super Bowl is amazing
uh but yeah you've got to think about
player health and safety which by the way on
the topic of concussions and Diana White
he's introduced this sport called slap
fighting really
you don't know how did I miss this are you
kidding me he's basically
he's oh you mean where they slap each other
in the face yeah it's not like fighting
but they think slap they stand there and they slap
each other and so you can take the hardest slap
that's wild which is you know ending
in edema all over people's faces
but not just that concussions as well
imagine getting slapped that hard
and I don't even think the prize
money pool is that great to warrant
something like this
um it's just unbelievable
it's like
why is he doing this
what's it called power slap
top five oh knockouts Jesus
yeah you just stand there defenseless
oh
see what I mean
oh
I mean you have to be pretty desperate
to get into something like this
there's girls doing it yeah
oh my god they're smacking the shit out of
each other okay this is
number three
oh do you see his head
wow he's insane
like how many
oh my god
why do they powder their
oh so there's a stick probably huh
yeah
it's the sort
at least they caught his head
yeah but they've just concussed them like
yeah that
that is bizarre
Dana White's doing that
yeah he um he's doing that
wow imagine being that rich
that you think let's
see how people can just
voluntarily give themselves brain damage
people love violence
is that what it is
is that what it is
I think violence is like
the most
compelling
form of entertainment to watch
like Roman gladiators
fighting to the death was like the first form of
entertainment right for
in civilization at least
and it's like that's the highest stakes
yeah I often think
if you've been given the education
which you know we should be
educating players on you know the health
and safety of their brains and knowing that hey
this knock to your head
at this velocity because you got to remember
as well a concussion you know just hit
your head and then you can cast a concussion
you have to you know get it at the right place
in the in the correct velocity
you could just get a hit to the head
it doesn't mean you're gonna be concussed right
so it determines you know comes down to velocity
but if you if players are aware of that
and they're also aware of the magnitude
and they're also aware of hey you just got
hit in the head this is what your brain is doing right now
this is what it's gonna do in the next year
if they still know and they're voluntarily going out
there then it's that's it's up to them
that's your
they can't tell me how to live my life they're not gonna
say you shouldn't do this so
yeah well I mean
who knows how aware they are what actually happens
before they get into the NFL but like a lot of them
like grow up with a dream of doing that
and like getting into that and making that and plus
you're making millions and millions of dollars
not saying they shouldn't be paid more they probably should be
paying more but
you know there's a trade-off that they're making a choice
and there's definitely
lots of science and evidence and documentaries
proof of the brain damage that happens
people and people going
postal and committing suicide and
killing people and beating their spouses
and it's it's a laundry
list of problems that happens with brain damage
but
yeah I don't know
what about um what I wanted to ask you
I wanted to ask you about one thing we didn't talk about was
uh sauna stuff
love it you love the sauna oh yeah
where you know the amount of benefits you have
speaking of brain damage can't you damage your brain in the sauna
can't you cook your brain I mean depending
again how heroic you want to be
uh-huh yeah I mean
what was it um what's
the last name plat where she put her head in the oven
who the one who
um is it Sylvia plat or something she put
her head in the oven and and really yeah I
mean I I don't know why I even brought
that up but it just reminded me of it is there any
evidence of like damaging brain tissue
by being in the oven Sylvia plat
what did she do did she do something regarding
a writer wow did she do
something regarding an oven and putting
her head in the oven I'm pretty sure she did
there we go oh wow
they found her dead with her head in the oven
oh having sealed the rooms between her so
yeah you don't want to
you don't want to silver Sylvia plat yourself
her head in the oven having sealed the
room between her and her sleeping children
I read about this in a book actually
she was 30 years old
whoa
yeah that's dark I don't know why was she
evidently she she must have
been depressed yeah
oh look it says up the top
although Hughes does not know the name of the
pills explicitly whose
book did I read about her in I think it
was like Malcolm Gladwell had a book about her
hmm
yeah he wrote a book about um
he wrote a book about like mental health
and like like people who commit
suicide and like people
who some people
don't really want to do it or they're
like they do it to where they'll
do something to where they know there's a chance
of survival though there's not a
100% chance they're gonna die like right like
swan dive off of a sky scraper right then
you know you're gonna die but then some people do
stuff where it's like
I'm not really sure if I want to do this but I'm in such
a dark place right now that
this is like spur of the moment maybe I'll
live I'm like I'm on the fence
but I'm gonna try it
and that's when like people were like putting
their heads in ovens I think it was in England
where that happened that's really sad
yeah it's super sad okay so
I don't know where I was going with that that was part of the book
we got there yeah we got there because
you said can you cook your brain
more than likely you could possibly
yeah but um
we're not going to the extremes
just the same way people actually can die
from a from jumping
into those really cold rivers
and your heart rate
can slow down immediately you can actually
pass out there's actually been I think it's made
13 deaths from cold water
immersion because people jump into the cold
ice cold lakes and they get
in and they're so
cold that they pass out and they drown
so it's the drowning that actually
that kills them not the cold
so yeah again we've got
extremes but no let's talk about the beneficial
effects of heat shock proteins
they can
these heat shock proteins can go in and
induce you know foxo 3
which is just like
which is like a transcription factor
for it's like a longevity
gene if you will and
I've actually read research on these
heat shock proteins going in
and mimicking cardiovascular
workouts so
these you know the same
benefits you get to cardiovascular
system from running and
cycling for long periods of time you can get
from the sauna
the main reason I like it is for the
excretion of some of these heavy metals as well
now
is there
is there any other benefit like
people it's obviously like a
vasodilation that's happening right it's
dilating all of your arteries and everything
but then when people do that and they go into
cold that's like
that seems like it could be bad yeah
actually there's no there's not that I know
people like to do hot and cold hot and cold
going from you know hot and then going into
cold it's not a big thing but stressing
your system from doing hot and then cold and
then hot and then cold and vasodilating and constricting
it's actually not really
there's no like evidence to show that that's doing well
it could be just a
placebo where you feel you know
you feel the effects of one thing and then feel the shock of
another thing right right this I think
it was like a Swedish or Norwegian study that was
done with the saunas the like a
20 year study on sauna was that
only do you know if that was only with sauna or
was that there was no cold and cold involved in that no
it was like what like 20 something
minutes or like an hour a week
actually there's you know what they're doing
now there's a really great
guy a doctor named dr. Charles Ray
Zon I had him on my podcast he
is a psychiatrist and he
works with like major depression
and what he's doing and he's actually
shown this if you can
get what he did was he randomized
like I think it was like 20 patients
that he had who've got severe depression
who are on everything SSRIs
everything right
near suicidal people and he got
one cohort to
you know be on drugs
and keep taking their SSRIs
and then he got another cohort where he gave them
like a sugar pill okay just a fake drug
pretended to give them an SSRI
and he got them
in the sauna and he showed
that the people who weren't taking
the real SSRIs
they actually mimicked the
SSRIs and got them
off having like a placebo
what wasn't a placebo because you're actually
inducing the same effects the neuro
transmitter release from getting
into the hot sauna
so he showed they can actually
get people off taking
medication in
depressive patients through going
into a sauna albeit it was every
day and I think it was like a harsh amount
it was like two hours a day
so it was a long I don't think he did it
all at once maybe he was doing it in
like 40 minute increments but he showed
that the effects can actually
help mimic an SSRI
wow I've heard of that with
cold water but I haven't heard of that with sauna
and cold water too I think there's less evidence
around cold water I know with sauna
there's a lot more evidence and he's really
working towards actually getting saunas
into hospital settings
so
as far as like sauna like
duration and temperature like what
do you think is optimal for him it depends
have you got a do you get into the red
saunas or a dry sauna a regular sauna
the one that gets not the infrared
not the infrared yeah traditional yeah traditional
sauna and that's even hotter so you
can get the same effects if you're getting
in there for around 30 minutes
is the infrared
infrared better it's not
better or worse okay I prefer
the infrared
okay but it just takes longer
it takes like you need to stay in there for around
45 minutes because it takes longer to heat up
whereas if you're in the
traditional saunas it's you're already hot
you go in you just put the water on it's hot already
I like the traditional because you just pour the water on
the rocks with like the little sensor little
whatever and like it steams it up and it
makes it smell nice what temperature are you
getting to like 160 I was
gonna say yeah and these the infrared
160 is great
170
and the infrareds are getting up to around 170 as well
some people do like 200
I don't know how the hell you do that
again why
I don't know
yeah just to
impress everybody exactly it's heroic
is there a
like a level
of or a temperature of diminishing returns that you know
not diminishing returns but you don't
there's no I mean
unless you're doing it every single day and you becoming
adapted to the heat
then you can increase it a little bit
because it remember it comes down to your
core body temperature not the temperature of the
ambient temperature so the best way
to actually do it is if you've got
a thermometer
and you're measuring your own core body
temperature while you're in the sauna
get it to a specific
a specific temperature and then stay in there
for 20 minutes and you can release these heat
shock proteins that are just so beneficial for you
wow yeah amazing
well thank you so much
thanks for having me daddy this was fun
doing this I really appreciate it this was fascinating
I haven't done a podcast like this in a long time so this was
refreshing tell people that are
listening or watching where they can follow you
and watch your videos
or whatever you got online yeah I've got a
podcast called the neuro experience
I have a YouTube clip albeit the
small YouTube YouTube channel
Louisa Nicola and I
hang out on Instagram quite a bit Louisa
Nicola okay yeah
and you did a podcast with Dom a while ago
right I did I've had
all the great scientists that's amazing yeah
cool well thanks again I really enjoyed
it goodbye world
