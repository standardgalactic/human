Oh, people reading rap lyrics, you bastards!
I'm 63, I'm annoyed, and I'm having a bang, and I'm going to read this.
Funtan Soup by Little Bee, I'm assuming, that stands for.
Are you ready for this?
Oh my god, base god.
You can fuck my bitch, bastard god.
You swag to the maximum, swag 100 grand, 100 trillion.
Oh my god, damn base god.
I just love it every minute of this here.
Hopped in my car, then I dropped my roof.
Wet like wonton soup, that's just how I do.
Then I parked my car, then I fucked your bitch.
Wet like wonton soup.
God.
Eat the wonton soup, I got the cash like ching ching ching.
Bitches suck on my dick because I come like 36 ways, bang bang bang, you know?
AK-47, leave the bitch with no fucking aim.
Call my main bitch and say she's straight giving me brain.
You don't give no fuck, that's why I fuck her in the face.
Fuck you suckers head, and then I ask her what's her name, base god.
This is fucking hip, oh my god.
Fuck my main bitch, then I dump her in the forest.
Hose on my dick because I look like Frasier.
And Andy Mukhanokis, bitch I'm Johnny Cochran.
Hose sucks my dick because I took her to the opera.
Bitch sucks my nuts because I, when I swatches.
Fuck you rap niggas because you scared of my damn soap.
Bitch suck my dick because it's good to her damn health.
Now what the hell, is this really a fucking song?
That's not a song, that's crap.
How do you really feel about it?
That's fucking crap.
Bitch sucked my dick, I fucked the fate.
I mean that's, come on, it's more than ignorant.
You know, I mean, people buy that, they're assholes.
They're assholes, that's all I can say.
