I'm Chad McGee and I own Pawn Shops in Paradise.
I came to the Caribbean with a dream and commitment to building the finest pawn shop
operation one island at a time.
But I couldn't do it without my loyal Capswiz crew.
The islands are a mixture of eccentric millionaires, curious tourists, and diverse locals steeped
in history, unique culture, and adventure.
Every day something unique comes into our stores, but my true passion is exploring the
islands for remarkable finds.
Either way, my job is finding treasure, and treasure can be hard to find.
Welcome to Paradise.
The Cayman Island store is the headquarters for our company.
Everyone's based here, the investors are here, our accounting department, IT department.
Welcome to the Cayman Islands, baby!
It's just essentially located, it's very easy for us to get around to the other islands
from here.
Hey man, how you been?
Good man, good man.
A little bit.
Yeah, I'm good man.
Say more.
That's stuck in a little jam.
Yeah, talk to me what's up.
I need like nine grand today.
Nine grand?
Yeah.
Alright, I mean talk to me.
Coming into Capswiz today to look for Chad to see if I can get a quick loan of nine
grand.
Got a brand new car that's just came in from Miami.
He was interested in my Corvette, a wild box, so I'm hoping that I can get a nine grand
today.
You know, I know you've been after me for the Corvette for a while.
Yeah, but I know you're going to bring that to me.
Well I brought it.
Seriously?
Yeah, it's here.
Tyson had purchased a new car in Miami, just organized, getting it shipped over here to
the Cayman Islands.
I guess it just arrived, sitting on the dock at Customs.
They were trying to charge him $9,000 duty to have it released from Customs to come into
the island.
He came in, just needed the quick cash, wanted to do a pawn, put up his car as collateral
for nine grand, obviously no brainer on that car.
I mean nine grand, I can for sure do that, obviously, and the car is more than worth it.
I gotta check it out, of course.
I gotta make sure it runs good, check it through the gears, I mean everything's gotta be smooth.
I see you're ripping down the streets every once in a while.
Do I trust you so I just want you to be careful with it?
I like that car more than you do, probably.
Almost like me.
Alright, yeah, let's go check it out.
Well that's cool, man.
Yeah, I'm gonna bring my little brother too, cool?
No problem.
Hey, Sky!
Yeah.
Skyler, he's my little apprentice, my little protege, he does everything with me, and
I pretty much close most of the deals for him.
Dude, that's a sick bed.
That's why we're out here, bro.
We're taking her test drive.
Seriously?
Yeah, bro.
Sick Corvette, yellow, black rims, Z51 racing package.
Alright.
Be careful, right?
Yeah, of course.
Just give me a couple minutes.
I'll be right back.
Oh yeah, this thing's bad.
What did you think, bro?
It was fun, man.
I took it easy for you, man.
I thought you ought to take care of it.
What do you think of your idea?
Oh, of course.
Everything's good.
Smoothest PV, man.
You enjoyed it?
Yeah.
Yeah, he liked it a lot.
Let's go inside and see that cash.
He tested it out, said everything's fine with it, so said he took it easy, but you never
know which eye he's very unpredictable.
John, seriously, where are you doing?
Hi.
Welcome.
Cash rate is not going to help you.
I brought in a necklace.
I brought in a necklace today.
I know that the price of gold is going up so much that I just want to see what it was
worth to us.
I have all the documentation.
This is where it was found.
This is everything that I received from our family.
Mom, I might need some help with this.
What you got here?
Well, this was left to me.
Wow.
It's been in our family for years.
This is beautiful.
And what is it you're trying to do with it today?
Well, I just really would like to get a price, see what it's worth.
Let me see what you got here with it.
This is a certificate?
It's everything I have.
1715 fleet.
Two Ascudas.
That's incredible.
Have you ever heard of it?
Yeah, absolutely.
We actually have bought a lot of coins like this.
I've never had one in such an amazing setting as this, but definitely dealt with quite a
few of these coins.
Man, this is a tough one.
Do you have any idea what you thought it was worth or what you were looking for for it?
I really have no idea.
I mean, it's been handed down to me.
Is it even real?
I hate Dass's questions, but...
I guess it's fine.
Find out for sure that it's so gold.
Careful.
That's a nice piece.
Just a polishing stone won't cause any damage to that.
Don't be scratching, please.
18 karat.
That's what I figured it was.
That fills you with 18 karat?
Yep.
A little bit of acid right there.
And it's about three and a half ounces of gold.
Honestly, though, although these things retail for about $15,000 new, it's definitely not
going to be too close to that.
I would say I probably would pay somewhere between $7,000 and $7,500 for it.
But you're telling me it would retail at $15,000?
Yes, it would have new probably retail for $15,000.
Second hand, though, I would say it would probably go for less than $10,000.
Based on the work and effort that I would have to put into selling it, I'd probably
be comfortable, like I said, maybe up to $7,500.
I think I'll have to wait.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What are we waiting for?
Well, I'm not sure if I'm really ready to give it up.
Okay.
At what price would you be willing to give it up?
Maybe the $15,000.
If anything changes, you definitely know where to find us.
Okay, well, let me think about it.
Okay.
I came to get that watch.
Choke on this, baby.
It's incredibly rare that you find a concretion that has a gold coin and silver coin together.
No, it's common.
Really?
I have some stuff I need to sell of high value.
We got a call from Concierge, one of the casinos, said the guy needed some quick cash.
I was trying to find something to help him out with and noticed that he had a 18 carat
gold Rolex.
My things aren't for sale, though.
It's just a pawn, man.
You're going to come right back for it.
All right.
Give me what you can and I'll be back in the morning.
I could probably work probably eight for you, man.
Eight grand?
What I can do with that, man?
Okay, let's just get this done.
I got people waiting, man.
Ah, the casino host guy said you're a good man, anyway.
I'm surprised how close this place is to the casino.
All right.
I just need your signature there at the bottom and that beautiful watch of yours.
Okay, baby.
You're coming back soon to papa.
Don't worry, man.
I'll keep this safe, all right?
Let me go get you some cash.
So this morning, sitting there, just opening up the shop.
Escalade pulls up.
Private driver gets out, lets this guy out of the car.
Never seen him before.
Literally pulls out a freaking lot of cash like this.
Here you go, Darren.
Give my watch back.
I came to get that watch.
Choke on this, baby.
Let me make sure this is straight and get you what you need, all right?
Great.
Pretty nice guy.
I guess he's some kind of producer here or something.
Darren said that you were a producer.
Yeah, we make some movies, all kind of movies.
We shoot here in the Bahamas.
All right.
Everything was good.
There's some paperwork.
There's your watch.
I just need you to sign this top line for me, please.
So my boy took good care of you.
Everything was great.
Pleasure doing business with you.
I really appreciate it.
Don't forget that.
All right.
There's my baby.
Yeah.
It's good to see you, man.
You need anything else?
You let us know, all right?
I'll be back.
Character, man.
Haven't met anybody like him.
That's the one I can do this for.
What are you guys doing?
Making a gong salad.
Did you get the storage room of the pawn shop?
Yeah.
It's like so unsanitary.
It's so delicious.
You need more ketchup?
No, I don't.
Do you want to try some of that, dude?
Yeah, I'm not even going to get my fingers.
Okay, use your fingers.
You have my fingers all up in there.
Yeah, just put your foot in it.
Did you get one solid onion?
That's disgusting, bro.
The part that's written like ketchup.
Yeah, you did.
It's so spicy, dude.
It's disgusting, dude.
I'm not going to eat any of that.
No, I wouldn't recommend it.
Are you serious?
Reaper!
Put the banana.
Crew's ship couple came in.
Raise a couple.
I think they're from Russia or something like that.
I don't really understand their accent at first,
but, you know, I pulled out this
concretion that we purchased the other day,
a handful of old pieces of eight,
kind of some crappy things, actually.
These are literally still just
pretty much concretions.
They have never been cleaned.
The top coin is a Philip IV,
which I think was minted
between like 1635 and 1665.
This one?
Mademire, you have to listen.
It's just no better than you.
Relax, relax.
This one was minted in Utrecht,
and that was minted in 1711.
One nice coin,
but they're so damaged.
It's nice.
Well, I know, but that's kind of what
makes it so unique.
They have concretions like this.
But they're uniquely damaged?
Yeah, it's been sitting on the bottom of the ocean
under a shipwreck for 250 years.
I mean, it's incredibly rare
that you find a concretion
of gold coin and silver coin together.
No, it's common.
Really?
And two coins.
One is said to be $10.
He will say it's $100,
and he will say it's $200,
and for somebody it can be $1,000.
You never know.
The gentleman that we had evaluated
said, I think it's been 35 years
he's been in the business
collecting things like this,
and the guy is literally ready
to cut off his right arm to have that
because he's only seen three
in his lifetime.
So give me a back for this one.
No problem.
Please Vladimir, can you say please?
I said.
Vladimir paid $40,
it's maybe worth $80,
maybe $8,000,
or maybe $8 million
in a half a century
that he will sell this somewhere
on the crisis. You never know.
And Skyler loves to hustle.
Customers come in here all the time
and they either think one or two things.
I need to get somebody else to help me.
This kid can't work in this store,
or he thinks that they get one over on him
just because he is a kid.
Should we be in school, buddy?
No, I practically run this place.
Yeah, okay, cool.
I have some stuff I need to sell
of high-value outside wave runners.
You might want to get some experience,
a boss, supervisor.
So it's a C2RXPX,
I invested $25,000 in it.
He's just thinking I'm some little kid,
a little bit more experienced
than he thought I was. Same thing with everyone.
It's a C2RXP,
2008 as a road tax engine,
four-tech. It's four stroke,
meaning you don't mix no gas.
It has a C-tech
supercharger.
When I first saw the jet ski,
I knew that it would be an awesome way
to make money for the company.
How much is it now, man?
He wants to sell this,
get some money to upgrade that one.
So you're looking to sell it, right?
I'm not sure how much it's worth now,
but I have at least $25,000 in it
along with some other extras.
Well, I'll tell you what,
I definitely have to have a camp to look at it first, man.
I definitely couldn't buy something like this
without having a professional look at it.
He says everything's cool, you know we'll go from there.
Everything will be cool.
Thanks a lot, Andre.
Scott looked pretty much how to handle it.
He had everything, he'd already talked to him,
everything up to then.
Just needed to get it checked out
by the mechanic at that point.
We went down to Seven Mile Beach
to go meet up with the mechanic,
talk about the jet skis.
This is the ski I called you about.
A guy came in looking to sell it.
I'm not 100% sure on the price yet.
He told me all kinds of
performance upgrades it had,
all kind of cool stuff.
I'm gonna check it out,
make sure it's mechanically sound
so I can go back and know if it's
a good deal for me to buy it or not.
You know, the guy told me it had
all these performance upgrades,
but you can never really believe what people say
until you get it checked out.
We have a lot of external gauges here.
Looks like they spent some money on this thing.
Let's take a look at the motor.
Dang.
Look at the intake on that thing.
I'd say this is probably 300 horsepower.
There's a lot of upgrades on it.
Let's fire her up, see how she sounds.
That's what it sounds like.
That was something good.
Let's take this bad boy for a run, man.
Whatever you need to do to make sure that it's good.
MUSIC
The guy came in,
he had pawned a gold necklace,
he lost his paper, forgot what his due date was,
forgot his excuses.
He didn't come back for it.
He was due three weeks ago.
We took the gold, packed it in with the rest of it,
sent it out to our refinery, melted it down.
I mean, comes a gold block,
and that's what we turned into cash.
So the business worked.
MUSIC
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
By the time I get there,
one second later,
I'm going to go around with John on top of him.
You got to calm down,
if I haven't let you up.
You understand?
John, let him up for a second.
Check him out.
The best thing I want to do
is scrap somebody's necklace.
Once it's gone, they can't sell it.
They can't pawn it here with me anymore.
That was something good.
Let's take this bad boy for a run, man.
Whatever you need to do to make sure that it's good.
Jack throws his son, Paul, on the jet ski.
Let's him go out and rip it up.
He's a pretty well-known jet ski racer here, actually.
If anyone could run this thing to its limits,
he definitely could do it.

How's that? Just fast as hell, man.
Yeah, good in the corner still? A beast.
All right, that song's good, guys. I think this thing's good.
That ain't perfect. That's all I need.
All right, cool, man.
Let's try it around and bring it back to the shot, man.
Thanks a lot for your help, Pablo.
All right, John, let's do this.
I decided to let Skyler handle this deal on his own.
We know the jet ski's worth at least $15,000.
Pablo says it is. That's good.
Skyler, you know, he's the one who started the deal.
Told him I wanted to get this jet ski for $10,000.
I don't want to help you.
I don't want to do anything once you go out there
and close the deal.
So Andre comes in. He's trying to hustle me.
Pablo, the mechanic, said that everything's working out good.
It's in good condition.
And what are you looking to get for it?
You work for Cashmere's, right?
Give me your offer.
It's a hard market. People want their jet skis to be custom.
Someone who wants a racecraft already has a racecraft.
It's already built.
I'll offer you five grand.
No. Minimum amount taken is $12,000.
I want it, but I don't need it.
Now I'm in a business to make money.
I'll offer you $6,000.
$11,000.
Thank you.
I'll do eight and a half.
Five.
Nine and a half thousand.
All right, I'll do that, but you got to give me a ski and a grand.
So it's eight and a half.
That's my final offer, not a penny more.
Eight and a half.
Wait, what's up?
What's up, bro? You all right?
No, I'm not really. Couldn't get it for ten grand.
Dude, are you kidding me? You should have come and got me, man.
I'm sorry. I couldn't.
Yeah, I told you I wasn't going to help you because I wanted to see what you could do.
I don't actually mean don't come and get me.
I don't really need your help, though, because I got it for $8,500.
Dude, are you kidding me, bro?
No.
I'm glad I had you close the deal. I would definitely pay more than that.
Dude, you are the man.
Maybe the next deal that I do, you can take some notes.
Oh, really? Don't get cocky. I thought you had to close those deals, bro.
This kid, he always surprised me and I'm really, really proud of him.
He did a killer job today.
The Caribbean is my home.
That means the ocean is my soccer field.
After a long day of work, there's no place I'd rather be.
Sometimes people ask me why I decided to hunt treasure.
I guess it just comes with the territory.
Thank you for watching.
