Nathan Crock ladies and gentlemen we are live on the podcast with the genius himself
greetings all the way from what planet you come from today Zorbon Zorbon how far
as it's beyond human comprehension well thank you for blessing us with your
with your knowledge and your presence today it's an honor I really enjoy chatting
with you guys I'm looking forward to whatever we end up discussing today it's
always fun we first discussed doing the podcast again I think we wanted to talk
about the basics of reasoning and forming arguments because these are things
that are relevant to pretty much anybody whether you're negotiating a business
deal or you're arguing with your grandma yeah what elements go into it we
probably should start a little deeper than that let's do it yeah let's get real
deep all right so whenever you talk about forming an argument you're
essentially trying to convey some sort of a truth or some sort of a fact but
the problem is is that humans are subject to different stimuli that combine to
give them their own internal opinion of what quote-unquote truth is right and
so it started way back in you know Greek Aristotle Plato basically they have
these the three main things that influence people and what they decide is
gonna be true is their instincts and their their primal sort of you know
evolutionary inclination survival sex food shelter right safety and then
they're persuaded by emotions they feel certain things and they determine their
emotions to be connected with their human experience and what's more real than
my experience that I'm having right now I experience it therefore it's real right
and then there's rationality and reason and logic so traditionally ever since
the old days back with the Plato Aristotle and Socrates etc reasoning at
the top level it was considered the way to go and if you didn't use logic and
rationality you were you were base you were beneath everybody else you were
not a fully-functioned human if you will you know people have been a little more
relaxed about that over the years thankfully but the majority of the
field of philosophy is sort of built on that premise right so just learning how
to form and construct arguments within this logical rational framework and the
reason that I said it's important that we go a little bit deeper is because if
we start just at the rationality and the reason in the logic we're not gonna get
very far because most people don't reason like that nowadays that's the
academic way of doing it that's what people in in and academic intellectual
circles you know their discussions and their debates are unlike anything you
have at Thanksgiving or New Year's Eve when you and your your grandma are just
you feel like your argument is more valid when you say it more loudly right so so
that's sort of the the foundation and then why is understanding that so
important to somebody like you like why how did you get so interested in
understanding this and become such an expert in it first off I'm an expert in
machine learning and artificial intelligence so I wouldn't I wouldn't
dare say I'm an expert in these things is I have found to be a very interesting
hobby and any sort of an intellectual person or an academic person I think has
a responsibility to understand what it is that they consider to be true or
truth if there is any such thing which hopefully we might talk about so this is
important to know when you're in science basically at least at least right so very
minimum I would think most scientists should have a healthy respect and
understanding for the foundations of the scientific reason and how it fits into
the fundamentals of just logic and the epistemology you know metaphysics these
things the branches of philosophy that study the nature of reality the nature
of knowledge and how how we can go about even acquiring it I mean at the end of
the day like let me ask you this okay prove to me that your soda there exists
it's sitting here I can feel it and I'm drinking it okay so philosophically you
might say well when you say you're feeling it what does that actually mean
so just just grab with the touch I can I can reach out I could grab with my hand
and I can touch it and I feel the sensation of the the chug chug koozie
around the icy cold LaCroix okay alright so what you're trying to say then is
that there's a physical object there because you perceive yourself as sensing
it right but as we know everything is composed of atoms and atoms are almost
completely empty space and they have electrical charges around them so what's
actually happening is you're feeling like you're feeling it but there's no
contact between matter there's just a repulsion of electric charges so you're
not actually feeling it you're feeling the result of something having been there
but you're not explicitly feeling it right and then you can go into the same
argument for vision well I can see it no you're seeing the result of something
having been there a photon bounced off of it and then came and hit your retina and
your retina interpreted the wave length of the photon as its color and
everything so you're not actually seeing it you're just seeing the result of
something having been there okay okay all right so now this all goes down into a
rabbit hole of materialism versus immaterialism and we don't need to
know all those all those details all we need to know is is the surface level of
it in general right so but what it really comes down to is physicists and
engineers they they acknowledge that this is a thing and then they go so I
don't need to prove that it's actually there I can just measure the result of
it having been there and I can do things with it and I can predictably get some
outcome when I interfere with whatever is there I can't tell you that something
is there or what it is but I know the result of it there I can measure and
sense it etc right right so this is what you're confronted with when you're
supposed to be an intellectual person trying to find truth right okay at the
fundamental level if you want to even prove something exists not as trivial as
as we immediately think it as we take our intuitions for granted and upon
introspection and reflection we find that these things that seem so obvious at
first are are much more complicated than we initially gave them credit for which
is in my opinion exciting okay so where do we go from here right so sure well
I mean you got my head spinning Nathan all right cool so all right so this is
important so now we basically have a respect now for the importance of
trying to understand how individuals determine what is allegedly true right
okay and the reason this is important is because if you and I are sitting at the
dinner table and you know the whole family is over there and then you got
your girlfriend over here and you want to show off to your girlfriend how smart
you are by dropping some intellectual little logic bombs and trying to argue
with this other person and persuade them if you are not aware of the mechanism
that your fellow interlocutor is using and their ability to reason then you are
not going to be reasoning or convincing them within their framework right if you
recall from the last time we had a discussion I was saying that if I'm
going to be saying words I have a responsibility to communicate in a
language and a modality that you understand right otherwise why am I
even talking the same thing can be said about you trying to quote unquote
persuade or share knowledge with somebody right if you don't understand the
way with which they determine truth then how can you give them evidence that
something is true that you want to convince them of right right so for
example if you're a purely emotional person and I come and I give you the
super compelling a logical argument that's infallible and just beautiful
beautiful you're gonna go I don't care I don't like it because because because I
can just feel like I don't like it right yeah it's the same kind of the same
when some people when they think of something or some people they have a
stronger sense of touch or smell or vision so like when someone's trying to
describe something you know an idea they have like oh I see it happening this way
or no I feel this way about it yeah that sort of similar to what you're talking
about how people absorb information how people process different types of
information yeah so that's one piece of you're basically talking about the
sensory experience itself right and a lot of people I think in particular
George Berkeley that you might have okay so let's start with this I got an idea so
Ren√© Descartes right so he gave the whole Kogito ergo sum I think therefore I am he
was the quintessential skeptic who began the whole materialism versus
immaterialism thing and he's basically saying I can't actually prove anything
exists I can't show that this that this thing is real I get really uncomfortable
when I try and find logical arguments about things that are based off of facts
that I can't actually establish so he basically gave the analogy like look I
got a bucket of apples and I know that in here there's some rotten apples so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna dump all the apples out and then pick each one up
and inspect it and only put the good ones back in okay and the idea was is he was
getting rid of false facts about the world but he had to systematically
interrogate and inspect every single little element that he believed in okay
right and so when he did that he was like well where can I start what do I do
and so he basically decided that the only thing he can be certain of is true is
that he's thinking therefore that is his that was his starting place I think
therefore I am and then from that he then built this whole logical argument about
about how things are true and there's lots of problems with them for example
okay but then a little bit later on uh George Berkeley I believe he said you
know I'm not so sure that this I think therefore I am is sufficient enough right
what I really can depend on is is what I see and what I feel and what I touch my
senses my ability to perceive reality and so his was what was it
essayist paracopeia or something which is basically uh to be is to be perceived
mm like that one if a tree falls in the woods and nobody's around to hear it did
it make a sound right so it doesn't exist unless it was perceived and so that's
a really problematic way to go about things because then you you should be
afraid to go to sleep at night because as soon as you're no longer perceiving
your consciousness then you just cease to exist right so that's obviously not
true but then he went and he fixed that by saying well god is the all seeing all
perceiving thing that keeps us existing and okay so that was his whole approach
right and so these things started building on each other one after the other
and the idea is always at the fundamental level what is true like how if you
believe something you have a responsibility to ask yourself why you believe it
of course right and so how do you justify or convince yourself to believe whatever it is
that you believe if someone else jumped over the river and and landed on the grass if I jump over
the river and I clear the water I'm gonna land on the grass that's a really simple example
but here's the problem with that right so basically you're saying I've seen um a white swan today
and then tomorrow I see another white swan and the next day I see 10 white swans and all I see
is white swan so then I draw the conclusion that there must be white swans and that's all that
there is right okay yeah but there are not only white swans there are black swans or for example
you know you said this person jumped over the river and landed on grass so you're gonna do that
well so you basically had a sample size of one and then you just drew a conclusion that that's
going to be truth okay well what about if I'm walking through the ghetto over here and I get robbed
by a black guy okay does that mean that every black guy is now going to rob me you see how that's
that's a very dangerous line of reasoning to go to follow to its conclusion right right so that's
that can be the source of some of these saucy you know discrimination and racial topics is our
inability to actually compute these statistics that what seemed obvious to you a moment ago
has now been demonstrated to lead to a rather troubling conclusion right okay okay what someone
thinks is true has to rely on premises very good right yes what we would consider evidence premises
are mostly used when you're trying to construct an argument all right and so that's that's good but
the premises themselves are often assumed to be true they are held without proof so could that
also be a could a premise also be a bias that uh or no no bias is it has a slightly different
definition okay though under many circumstances you can sort of interpret them that way it's your
prior your bias your disposition to something a priori before before experiencing it or before
being presented with with new data okay yeah so a premise a premise can be completely falsified
because of a bias yeah it's great so now okay so first we talked about basically the foundation
of how people decide what's true or not now you're trying to talk about how we form arguments well
right yes you basically there's there's many types of arguments and the most obvious one to start
with that's really clear for a lot of people is the the deductive arguments right so um
all this is the classic one from all textbooks all humans are mortal
Danny is a human therefore Danny is mortal right all right so that would be a deductive argument
where the two premises are all humans are mortal and Danny is a human right and so those two premises
imply that the conclusion is true right right right right but I could say something like
all humans have tails Danny is a human therefore Danny has a tail right so I laid out two premises
into conclusion the argument itself is valid right because everything's logical one implies the other
but the conclusion's false because you clearly don't have a tail and the reason that it's false
is because one of the premises wasn't true okay you see what I mean yeah so this is why I can get
kind of hairy so when I'm here at the dinner table and I'm trying to say oh well you know all the
unions they're doing this and then the darn republicans doing this and then they draw some sort of a
conclusion about how conservatism is ruining the world or something yeah they're based on all of these
premises which are super loaded and you could have an entire evening just discussing a few of
these premises and trying to iron out like all the idiosyncrasies that give them veracity right
right well what's interesting to me is the uh all the different understanding all the different
types of biases people can have when you're a little kid and you grow up and your parents always
told you something was one way and when they come into an argument they assume that that premise
or something is some way specifically because that's all they know it's almost impossible to
have a constructive argument or a discussion with them when their premises there's no way
you can convince them that they're completely wrong all right so you're touching on what I
would consider to be one of the most important parts that I was hoping to eventually get to
it so we start with understanding that everybody has a different reason for forming their own
truths and then you say well once you have this mechanism for reasoning then there's this approach
this technique for forming arguments and then the question finally becomes why right so if I'm
gonna have a discussion with somebody else and the question is why are you and I even discussing
in the first place right and the answer to this we're gonna get back to what you just said okay
so if we're discussing something usually in a very heated and insulting way with many four letter
words which happens far too often it's because there's something that's important to both of us
and our alleged solutions to this thing differ donald trump needs to be impeached donald trump is
doing a great job in fixing america right so here we are we now disagree although i'm being
hypothetical right right it's uh academically rigorous and respectful to try and consider
the other person's perspective as best as possible before you start trying to tear it down right so
yeah so here we are and we disagree with each other okay so the question is are you trying to
convince me of your perspective is that is that what we're doing right now right i want you to
i want you to agree with me right okay and i'm gonna do the same thing right but not not everyone
some people just want to fight that's true there are those people watching the world burn can feel
good joker for example right um let's assume that we have the sociopaths out of the room and they
don't just okay watch the world burn okay but yes that's true so then the question the the logical
conclusion from this is you are this person that you just said who has a firmly held belief in
intuition that they uh found from their parents or from some experience in being raised i too was
raised in a different environment different statistics i was exposed to different data and i
have an equally firmly held belief but different than yours right i'm trying to convince you of
mine and you're trying to convince me of yours right what do you think is going to happen
it's gonna get ugly we're just gonna we're not even gonna communicate we're just gonna
yell arguments at one another and i'm not interested in your perspective my job is to
convince you of my perspective right but you're not interested in my perspective you just want
to convince me of your perspective so you see how this is doomed to fail like from the onset right
so when you go into a discussion with somebody and you have the idea that i want to win this
discussion you've already failed that's that's not what discussions are for true intellectually
responsible what they're called interlocutors people who are you know the interlocutor interlocutors
yes these are people who engage in philosophical debate they're not interested in winning winning
isn't a thing they are interested in finding a deeper truth about the world so if i come to you
and i give you this awesome argument that i'm super convinced is great and then you go
hmm it turns out that you made some fallacious conclusion in your third you know inductive
argument or something i should be grateful for that yeah a lot of people go into those those
looking for looking for a fight rather than looking for an opportunity like they're looking for
you should look at it as an opportunity to share your ideas or to learn from them
but a lot of people look at it as going into a conflict or going into a battle they do and i
would say it's even more than looking at looking at it as an opportunity to share because that's
that's the selfish perspective again i want to tell you what i'm thinking right more precisely it
should be i am excited to have the opportunity to refine my ideas only if i am willing to admit
that my ideas sharpen your blade yeah only if i'm willing to to to uh let go of my convictions
only if i'm willing to admit that i'm wrong does holding on to the idea even mean anything for
example if i'm talking with a historical case it could be saucy for some but particularly religious
people who hold their convictions unfalsifiably and they're unwilling to relent and i usually
ask a simple question that lets me know their disposition i say um what what would you need
to experience or be presented with to change your mind to stop believing right and then as soon as
they go nothing then you know that they've forfeited their faculty of logic and reason and they're not
okay they're they're basically just holding their conviction unfalsifiably right right you just
agree to disagree oftentimes that's that's sort of the best you can do in those cases because
all right so so the idea for me though is that when i go into a discussion well i want to finish
that conclusion right so this person holds their conviction and their idea just unfalsifiably like
they're never gonna let this thing go right that conviction is equally as meaningful as me saying
i believe i have unicorns in my stomach right right and the reason is is because neither of us
are willing to let it go which means it isn't really worth it isn't worth any it has no meaning
like there's no substance behind it only when i have a conviction that i'm willing to let go
that i've tried to prove wrong over and over and over again and throughout the past three years i
had been like consistently trying to prove my ideas wrong and i just can't prove them wrong
then it starts to mean something and that is the spirit of the scientific method right people
like the old-fashioned psychologist Freud he was doing what was called pseudoscience right so
essentially he would basically look at things from the past and justify them with things from
the future he could make every girl's problem turn into a source of penis envy or every man was in
love with his mom right and he would just use some psychological uh and conversational magic to
basically justify everything right that is not how science works science is exactly the opposite
actually rather than justifying past observations with my current perspective for opinion i'm gonna
make a prediction about the future that tries to disprove my current uh held belief my current
theorem okay so for example if i let this go what's gonna happen it's gonna drop and smash on the
table right exactly right and the reason that you believe that is because people have been trying to
disprove that since newton and nobody has been able to disprove it right therefore we have a justified
our belief that it is going to fall has been justified because nobody's been able to disprove
it right but when you go into an argument again and you have this firmly held belief that you're
not willing to let go that belief doesn't really have much substance because you haven't spent
years actually honing it and sharpening it and proving that it's true not only that but you've
stopped growing you're you're if you are not willing to adapt your ideas and you expand and try and
find something more consistent with reality than you're stunted right right the other person who's
really interested in if you prove the other person wrong and they go oh thanks that was great
they just grew and became better and they now have a deeper truth about the world and you're
stuck just being believing in whatever you believe for no reason because you're not willing to admit
that it could be wrong and refine your ideas right all right so here we go i'm gonna argue on the
opposite side of discrimination and try to convince you that it's okay all right so i'm gonna take the
hard side first so all right let's say that uh rosy and bob they own a cake shop okay and a group
of people come in and they ask rosy and bob to make them a cake about some um uh Nazi extremist
celebration that they're about to have when they bring all the white supremacists together okay
and rosy and bob say no i don't want to do that i disagree with that you and many might say well
good they should not do that because they shouldn't support that kind of a thing right fine but then
again the very next day um some two men might come in and ask rosy and bob to bake a cake about
homosexuality for their wedding right and at the same time rosy and bob go no i don't want to
bake you that cake because i disagree in it i disagree with that so what's happened is in
that second analogy you might have gotten a little more upset about they're like well that's not right
they shouldn't have done that right well she did is you condoned discrimination the first time
and then you said it's not okay to discriminate the second time so clearly it's not as obvious
as saying discrimination is just wrong there are clearly certain circumstances with which
discrimination is okay and it's not as obvious as we think well i mean it's a free country and
they own their own private business and they're allowed to make their own rules within their
own private business as long as they don't break the law is that right right but what if their
rules are imposing on the freedoms of others well they're free to go down the street and
go to another cake store and get another cake made but what if the entire community feels the
same way that those people do because of their collective beliefs and now there's a subsection
of the of the society that has been ostracized because nobody's giving them the opportunity
do you have any moral or ethical obligation to do something to help or is that just tough luck
i really i really there's nothing i could argue i don't i can't put myself in the
in the shoes of those people god damn it nathan this is hard i think that's really kind of the
important part here is that people take for granted their convictions and they argue from a very
limited understanding of the depths and the complexities of these things that they think
are so much more simple than they actually are discriminations clearly wrong clearly not
i mean not it's not clearly blatantly wrong it may be wrong sometimes and it may be justified
other times right so if for example what um if you see a lion walking down the street
and i say or behind me for example wherever there wherever one may be and then um you say
oh i'm gonna go pet it and i go no no don't go pet it it's gonna bite it's gonna bite you and you
look don't generalize not all lions bite okay what you just did is you made a statistical
generalization right which was based off of facts and observations that you've made yeah
so one might say that under certain circumstances statistical generalizations can be useful and
beneficial and other times they may be detrimental and troublesome and so the real uh
responsibility that i think people have is identifying what that threshold is where is it
suddenly not okay anymore and the beautiful thing about this is that line is different
for absolutely everyone and that's okay and that's really important that we understand that
because everybody has their own intrinsic subjective value system that we talked about
earlier is based off of one of these three things and everybody's just different there's
there's no truth behind which one of those are better right it's just fundamentally subjective
and so i think it's really important you know as we talk about these things that the viewers
are seeing that maybe these things that i held uh very strongly and firmly aren't quite as obvious
as i thought they were before all right here let's let's let's keep trying a few more
so do you think that everybody should be paid the same generally no i mean depend if somebody
is better at something or if something's been doing something for a longer amount of time they
should make more money but what if a certain part of the society has been disenfranchised for so long
that they don't really have an opportunity to acquire the skills necessary to be competitive
to then actually get that pay what do you do then all right well this is just a simple
intellectual experiment to demonstrate how the things that we think are our solutions are clearly
not right so this was presented at some economics conference and i remember this argument and i was
pretty compelled okay all right but essentially people like okay well we should force everyone to
pay uh all races the same for the same kind of a job right so they you have to make sure that
they make at least the same right that seems super fair it seems super fair right at the high level
but the reality is is that there's racist people out there right right so making the racist people
pay everybody equally doesn't make their racism go away and then you go oh well what it should do
is at least just fix the symptoms of it and it turns out that it does makes it worse probably
and here's why here's the analogy that they gave which might be kind of crass depending on how you
look at it but i found it relatively and insightful um let's say you go to the grocery store and
t-bone steak is 12 a pound and chuck steak is two dollars a pound which one are you gonna buy
personally i'm gonna buy the t-bone okay t-bones 50 a pound and chuck steak is five
dollars a pound which one are you gonna buy still the t-bone no it's a hundred dollars a
pound fine i'll take the five dollar chuck steak and of course you all right so the point is is
that there was some point at which the chuck steak became reasonable to you now let's assume
that for whatever reason you go there and the chuck steak is a hundred dollars a pound and
the t-bone is a hundred dollars a pound which one are you gonna buy definitely the t-bone okay so this
is a crass analogy of course but there are people who perceive the difference between race to be the
equivalent to a t-bone versus a chuck steak and if you force everybody to pay them all the same then
these people who are already racist they're like well i mean if i have to pay them exactly the
same thing that i would have had to pay a white person then i'm just gonna hire all white people
right makes sense so clearly the the rule or the law that they have to pay everyone the same
in and of itself is insufficient you also need to then enforce that they have to actually hire
that many people as well to combat that racist tendency that might actually happen
so the thing that you think you know everybody gets paid the same that's fair well it has really
unintended consequences when you you know take some time to really analyze what what takes place
yeah all right and so these things in my opinion just demonstrate further how once you're convinced
of your ideas you're already wrong and just stop being super convinced in your ideas because
there are so many things that you don't really understand and i think if everybody had more
humility and more openness to other people's perspectives and more interest and being and
more interest in learning the truth than in being right then these things would solve themselves
because we talked about earlier when you and i are here and i want to be right and you want to be
right we're just gonna have a shouting match all day and we're not gonna get anywhere
right but if we're both more interested in finding truth than we are in convincing one or the other
of our emotional perspectives then we'll actually make progress and we'll be able to find some sort
of a common ground which is the only way that two people with differing views are going to find a
solution that appeases both sides that's sort of a solution intrinsically requires compromise
because clearly this person wants this thing and they want this thing and you can't have both of
these things at the same time so the only way to get any sort of a solution is something that gets
a little bit of both and misses something of others but nobody's willing to make compromises
because this is america and we're all entitled in the american dream and we should all get our way
right one thing that sticks out to me and that when you make that point is the article that you
sent me can we talk about that sure so the article you sent me uh was basically about a bunch of
the democratic presidential candidates correct me if i'm wrong um and the the person writing the
article was saying that those people their policies were center in the united states of the political
landscape of the liberal conservative and then center right right right yeah i mean the general
argument was exactly that like america's polarized but these three people should be considered
centrists and the reason ours because and who were the people you remember it was bernie sanders aoc
and warren i think okay okay and they say these people their ideas and and political positions
are centrists because they are consistent with most americans okay so that's a terrible argument
because right right right i can already see how that's yeah right so i mean that's a reminiscent
of geocentrism right so the earth is the center of the universe and you just define that to be
the center because that's where you are that's where we are sure i mean if you have liberals
over here and conservatives over here and then you get a nice bell there's a whole bunch of liberals
and then there's you know a few conservatives and then a whole bunch of uh a few centrists and then
a whole bunch of conservatives yeah this bell might be larger than this one over here but the
center's still in the middle you can't just redefine the center to suddenly be where you are that's
not how that works right right but the problem is that people were just like reposting this all over
because they didn't really care whether it was true or not they just liked the idea that their
idea it made them feel good yeah everyone likes to feel good and what did you think about my argument
to that or not my argument but basically you said that there was two bells right there was a huge bell
on the conservative side and a huge bell on the liberal side and then it dipped down in the middle
in the center and i thought that it could technically be just one big arc right because there's less
people on the there's less people on the very far left and the extreme far you know on the
extreme of each side there's less people yes um so i thought that it could be possible that maybe
the center is the highest point of the arc because maybe some of those policies do collide and there
there is some overlap there okay so two things one is i would entertain that discussion we can have
it but the premise from that person was that the american population is polarized okay polarization
almost necessitates that there's a dip in the middle where you've been polarized right there's
binaries one and then the other so the majority of americans have differing opinions right so that
was their premise and okay i see and as of right now i mean nobody knows exactly what that bell
looks like but i would or what that distribution looks like but i would suspect that if it's not
really small like i used in my naive example i would expect to see a dip in the middle okay i do
believe that social media and the ability for people to reaffirm their convictions with less
and less information and to be more and more certain about their ideas that are less and less
found in reality is just enforcing people to be more and more polarized and less open to the other
perspectives right now what exactly that looks like i don't know maybe you could come up like a bell
and there's just like a little dip in the middle you know i don't know but um yes i agree with
obviously the idea that there's few people at the extremes but even if the bell did look like that
right which to assume it's just a nice simple happy gaussian right um if aoc and warren and
bernie sanders are extreme liberals as they say that still doesn't define the center to be over
there the center right still in the middle right yeah it's funny about when you when you talk about
social media it seems like do you think social media has made it more polarized in the country
because of like the facebook ai only putting people on the left in their own echo chamber
and people on the right in their own echo chamber yeah it's a double edged sword right because you
know the the advertising engine the ai engine is essentially just trying to present you with
things that you want basically that that's all its goal is things that you're going to click on
things that you like yeah that's true it yeah i never never thought about it because the facebook
basically is just a giant advertising machine so yeah you want to they well the funny thing is
is they know what everybody wants they they know who you are down to your sperm count basically so
they can target you with whatever they want yeah it's interesting that i don't know it was quite
that well but uh it's it's true that they know probably more than we would be comfortable with
but it's not like it's not like um if you went and uh looked at uh jeep or something and then you
go to facebook and then suddenly you get advertisements for jeeps or something it's like oh my gosh it's
like reading my mind and i don't understand what's going that's not what's going on it's just simply
observing your behavior and things that you might or might not like and then just trying to present
things to you that are consistent with the things that you normally do right you know it isn't it
isn't super super terrifying in that regard in fact i personally kind of appreciate it i i hate
really boring obnoxious ads that have not like tampons or something like that that's not me bro like
you know we got this thing going on that i'm not a part of that and another thing with social media
is that um is communication people on social media like if you ever go to the comment section
anywhere youtube facebook super respectful twitter they're really respectful i love that and they're
and they're very vulnerable they're not ten foot tall and bulletproof yeah they all want to find
truth and they don't want to convince you of their ideas exactly encouraging
so how is that going to fuck with people in the long run when when exactly this problem we have
now right so when people like if you read the comments on on most youtube videos it's just
it's a cesspool of of people of spewing hatred basically and those people could never do that
in reality they could never walk down the street or go to publics and talk to somebody like that
and when the line gets blurred between reality and technology what's going to happen with communication
so as you know i am a big fan of communication i really appreciate all of those things but we
have to sort of put this into the big perspective right so our ability to communicate and interact
with others has been finally honed over hundreds and thousands of years in earth on this planet
and subjected to the environment and the climate and the animals and this situation that we're in
right so for example um you know maybe i'm young and i'm growing up and i'm like experimenting with
social interactions and i walk up and i go dany you're fat and then and then you go and you make
like a sad face and then i'm like oh that doesn't feel good inside i don't i don't like that i just
made you feel that way right and then you start learning and under hopefully if you're a well
functioning human and you start like learning what you know what works what's good what doesn't
work in society and you sort of you get the feedback from the person that you're communicating right
that's how communication evolved right and the problem is is that um with technology advancing
at the rate that it is our ability to communicate sort of biologically and evolution evolutionarily
if you will um it hasn't been able to keep up with the rate that technology has been increasing
so we're all communicating at this new level at this paradigm that we weren't we weren't uh
developed if you will or we didn't we weren't uh we didn't come about to be able to harness or access
to its full potential and yeah it's got a lot of problems and you're speaking about one particular
one which in my opinion is one of the worst ones but yeah you just we need to take this individual
responsibility to be more interested in truth than just feeling good and finding our own ideas
and hearing more about our own ideas we need to say rather than just finding things that reaffirm
my idea i'm gonna consistently try and prove my ideas wrong so that i know they're more true
like the more you can't prove your ideas wrong the better they are that's hard to do that's hard
it's not easy to do that it's not an easy way to think it's not at all so how do you convince
people to think that way lead by example i mean um i you know it was kind of my hope when i was just
thinking about this that maybe for whatever reason we'd stumble upon something that we disagreed about
and then through just an open respectful discourse one of us might be able to find a deeper truth
and then just sort of admit it and then be like wow that was awesome all right education oh
shit all right i just cursed on the internet oh man we're live too i can't take that back
so what what what do you think about what's your stance on education if i want to grow up
my kid i'm about to have a kid any any minute now and he's gonna grow up and
my let's go back my parents always force it down my throat that i had to go to college
and figure out what i wanted to do with my life and that's how i would
develop a career and make money and live the american dream because they shoved it down my
throat so hard it it made me rebel and not want to do it for some instinctual some weird reason
i always wanted to do the opposite of what they what they told me or whatever they thought was
true with it what they thought was right i always want to do the opposite so i don't know if that's
true with everybody but it made me not want to go to college um long story short i did end up going
to like a community college for a year and a half and i dropped out so if you think college is the
right thing my first argument would be look at some of the most successful happiest people on the
planet and they didn't go to college they were self-taught in what they did and not not all but
but a lot you're talking about entrepreneurs they were self-taught extremely passionate about what
they did whether it was art whether it was business um whether it was doing shit like this like
podcasts or or making movies um they just found their own way and forged their own path to doing
what they wanted to do whether it be sneaking into the industry and working for free or like
Spielberg's sneaking onto a movie set and just pretended like he worked there pretend like he's
been there the whole time and just keep doing it and keep learning and keep meeting new people
and working his way up to being one of the most successful people in that field all right
let's pause dan is a lot a lot wrong with your arguments there okay so firstly you started off
with a description about your family and the things that your family were telling you about
education which is that might be relevant right it is completely irrelevant to an argument about
education although i care about your family i'm interested to know what's important to you but
as someone trying to share logical arguments if you're trying to say something towards four
or against education that wasn't a relevant point but an interesting precursor if you will
secondly um your argument about the well-being of of humans and their livelihood with or without
education still isn't actually an argument for or against education in and of itself wait wait
say that say that one more time so the livelihood of a human being in their happiness being independent
of education isn't really an argument either for or against education in and of itself i mean
what you what you might be having an argument more about is sort of the structure of society or the
the societal society's perspective on education perhaps it seems like what you have more of an
issue with rather than education in and of itself okay or do you have problem with the institution
of education where maybe the ideology behind what college should be isn't what's actually happening
i also have a problem with that great so we could have an argument aimed at some of those points
perhaps um well what are we having an argument i'm i i i education you brought it up in general
education i think i think the problem is is it lines the bank's money with pocket for people
going into debt to get student loans to waste four years of their lives just to come out of
college and not be able to get a job and what they supposedly spent four years doing and that's what i
see with a majority of the people i'm around and meet every day um that's one part of it with the
institution i think it's fucked um for more for lack of a better term um that's the academic term
yeah that's the academic term um so i guess we got to get back to what is what is the actual argument
right your contention is with the institution itself you think that education has an objective
and it is not accomplishing it and if i think about it i kind of use that i kind of do use that
examples of people who have achieved massive success without college as kind of a
a reinforcing premise to that a couple of things to just keep in mind although i don't know your
experience people frequently do that all the time to like well look at bill gates right exactly yeah
i clearly don't need to go to high school or college right right so the problem there is
you have a sample size of one okay and there's hundreds and millions of people right and so you
can't draw a conclusion about everybody on average with a sample size of one okay okay so that's just
not that's not good statistics in general right um secondly i would say to you i'm not sure how many
of these people that you've been looking at about their livelihood and happiness and well-being but
just make sure that you're also doing some quick statistical analysis behind you're not doing what's
called um um this is one of the biases that you were talking about uh confirmation bias confirmation
where you're just looking for things that reaffirm your own ideas already because be honest with
yourself how many people out there are actually miserable without education i'm not saying that
there are some or are not some i'm just saying make sure that you weigh both sides of this coming
to your conclusion right and then the second uh part is essentially about the institution itself
so yeah i completely agree with you i hate it it's it's a pain in the ass um however however
so it's totally true that the institution has been sort of flipped around to where people
have to pay too much for skills that they're that aren't very useful but there's there's
more to it than just that it isn't only a fault of the education it's actually a fault of the
society right in my opinion as an as an educator who's taught classes and universities and been
in front of people the students come into the classroom with this with this position
that it's my responsibility that they learn right and so they just sort of like sit there
and they're like okay cram knowledge in my cram knowledge in my brain i don't want to be here
but this is where i'm supposed to be so now make it worth my time and the problem is is that that
entitled perspective yeah it's just not at all how knowledge works you you can't learn something by
just osmosis right you learn by doing right you need to actually go home and do homework you need
to do the problems my job is not to make you learn my job is to facilitate your journey through
learning and advise you and guide you to not make the pit falls in the mistakes that other people
but it's an individual journey you have an individual responsibility to want to learn you
got to be hungry for knowledge you got to read these books you got to be interested in figuring
these problems out and if you're not then don't go to college it's not it's not the people's
responsibility to motivate you that's not what college is for colleges and a place for education
not a motivational institution okay and why are these entitled kids there well because that's
that's the american culture right so if you think like a really parents told them they gave them an
ultimatum you have to go to college but it's not their fault entirely right look at the structure
of america over the years that was how it worked right before the advent of the internet if you
went up to a job and you said you should hire me they're gonna go why and you go because here's
a piece of paper that says that i did these things for four years which means that i am
certified to do these things for you right right but nowadays with the advent of the internet
just a danie jones can just start making youtube videos and showing his skills without any sort of
education and people like i don't care what your education is you can clearly already do what i
want you you can already do what i need you to do so you're you're hired same thing with coding
and programming right google hires people straight out of high school they don't care if you have an
education if you can do it then they need you to do it that's how the industry works right
college is essentially like an institution for higher learning it is the pursuit of advancing
the frontier of humans human knowledge that's what it was initially designed to be it was like an
academic institution where people came together to just philosophize about the things that just
make humans break into the future teleportation these big dreaming things right and it slowly
turned into like this job factory where you can't get a job without a piece of paper and then the
parents from you know the 50s 60s 70s that was what they were raised with and what they thought so
then they start pounding that down the throats of their children but suddenly the society and the
culture has been changing such that these things aren't really useful anymore a because technologies
change things and two because the culture of the students themselves is changing such that
the standards in the universities have to keep dropping or else all the students will just
keep failing because they're not really trying as much anymore and in general there are some
really great students and i have a i'm encouraged by a lot of them and they're they make teaching
worth it for me completely yeah um but yeah so there's there's a lot of problems there but it's
it's deep right so your initial qualm if i recall was essentially that the institution itself is
making the american uh economic situation just worse basically the next generation of people
are going to come out with debt and no skills that are marketable or valuable right right exactly
and then somebody wants to like point fingers and say whose fault is it or we can say how can we
fix it we make education free so they're not in debt well that's not going to help if there's
somewhat getting any value from the education because the standards are too low or you know
there's all kinds of possible explanations or solutions each with pros and cons and those pros
and cons are determined by your internal value system and everybody's got different ones right so
what do you think about free education or making like a universal education like a certain like a
like a certain whether it's a certain level you can get for free in the country that's a good one
that's that is one which i am probably most uncertain on right because most of what i i
believe that i know from reading observation and and the studies that i've learned from economics
is people value what they pay for and that value makes other people want to make it more valuable
by increasing its quality and this is just a virtuous circle where the things that people
pay for get better and improved because people want money so that they can live and do their things
that they want so they make things more valuable that people are willing to pay more for and so
on and so forth right so the quality of education um can be influenced very strongly by how much
resources or utility goes into the system itself right but then again we have a sort of a cultural
responsibility to ensure that people get educated and what if you don't have a lot of money right
so then what do we do about them well you say oh too bad maybe you might say that well the problem
with that is now what are they gonna do they're just gonna become a drain on society and doing
food stamps and being homeless and then you're gonna complain about homeless people and people
taking food stamps but they're only that way because they couldn't get access to education
because you know see you see what I mean so it's it's not again it's not as simple as people
think it is right and if you want to learn anything you can go on the internet I mean
to an extent and learn it more than to an extent it's baffling man I mean I learned how to I
fucking put his shoulder back into place this weekend by looking up a youtube video dude the
so my advisor and I you know we we talk about this frequently we believe I became a doctor this
weekend dude sorry to interrupt no you pretty much can like there's an entire neuroscience
course from duke university from this awesome professor something white and he's just got
hours and hours of videos of him just like cutting open brains and explaining to you just
everything you need to know about the human brain basically the entire first year of medical school
you can just sit at home and just watch for the hell of it right I mean hey are you kidding me
like all right so anyone who wants it can get it yeah exactly why aren't more people getting
Danny why aren't more people getting it Danny it's a good question because you have to have
that piece of paper to be if you want to go operate on somebody you have to have that
how many years do you need to do that to be a neurosurgeon yeah that's true for neurosurgery
in particular though we that's a separate argument because I personally would be pretty happy that
whoever's cutting my brain open has jumped through their hoops and you too baby I got I got this
but what about uh you know fixing phones for example right how do you get certified to do
that don't you don't do you can you I don't know that's a question for Rafa all right he teaches
he fixes phones and he makes youtube videos on how to do it and people can watch well where did
you learn how to do it yeah super good right and then he just makes the video so other people see
that he can do it right and then he reads resources and learns more about it well I mean you do
require skills that aren't necessarily trivial or easy to obtain to do it right you got to learn
some basics in programming basic hardware some basic soldering stuff yeah see so plus you got
expensive equipment and two you got to pay for right no okay yeah and here's the thing internet
go find a course on Coursera or edX or Udemy or any one of Julie or whatever any one of the million
websites that give you free courses and find one about mobile phones and I promise you I don't
promise you but I bet you probabilistically speaking five bucks that you'll find one email me if you
can't find it five bucks so seriously I mean it's it's out there so the question is that you said
why aren't more people doing it and it's the same reason that they're not trying in the classroom
when I'm up there like doing a song and dance just trying to get them excited doing backflips off
of desks like hey love mathematics check out this integral how cool is this and I want to go to the
club on Thursday and see that cute boy yeah that's fine but can you just learn some math first
but another thing about another thing about um the internet and technology and learning is like
just like like these podcasts have blown up and there's a podcast about every single niche
so you can find this and literally find dozens and dozens of episodes of hour-long conversations
like this about anything and it's become hard to navigate to because I mean a lot of stuff's free
like this is free obviously people need to pay to watch this but there's a lot of people online
who who quote themselves as gurus in certain fields or certain uh subjects and they will pay you
and they'll they'll charge you for their content so it's become harder to navigate to find the
kind of content that you can trust to learn from that's super true because it's flawed yeah as they
say half of knowledge is knowing where to find it yeah oh I like that half of knowledge is knowing
where to find it I'll tell you I can't tell you how often when I'm doing my research at my desk
I flip around and I've got a bookshelf full of dozens of textbooks like stupid textbooks that
I've worked through over the years and I don't remember exactly the formula for whatever the
Lagrange interpolation or whatever thing that I need off of the top of my head but I know where
it's at and I know how it works and I know what it's used for so when I'm doing research and then
suddenly I'm like oh I need to to do this to find that oh well if I can interpolate through these
points okay how do I do this oh my numerical analysis book I get it I flip it out I find it
program up the algorithm and I'm done and I can move on right okay but the point there is as you
were saying is there's so many textbooks out there you can go on Amazon there's just hundreds
thousands millions of books which ones should you use and maybe that is an argument for some
form of a formal education just to meet the people who can guide you in enough but see that's not
really formal education that's just mentorship which is something that I strongly agree with and
even at Newside the company that we have in Newside Labs most of the people who come in
to Newside Labs they're interns and they don't even have these are some of like the best students
at FSU you know I take only the best of the best like straight A students I ask them like hard math
questions or interview questions before they even come in and they still don't know anything even
remotely close to get started with machine learning because it requires demanding a knowledge of
probability theory mathematics programming data engineering and back-end cloud server side stuff
where do you get that in a university setting you don't you take biology and chemistry and you
know mathematics right so the question is where do you acquire the useful skills right and so for
me this internship opportunity was for me to get these students in here who have potential who work
hard who want to learn and then I know where they can find the resources because I've done it and I
do it and so while they're there working with me I go okay well you're trying to solve this problem
I'll solve this work through this tutorial and then come back and I'm gonna and grill you to make
sure that you've learned this and then once you know you know we'll work on it together to demonstrate
they've got the hard work rather than the students who come in and go teach me to learn I want to
know that I want to know that they are hungry for knowledge that they're gonna read and learn what I
tell them to read and learn that is how that mentorship educate apprenticeship like education
cycle should be structured in in my opinion because that's what works for us and they find it very
valuable and you only take interns from the college like students of the college's interns or could
you take anybody I'll walk in there and want to be your intern would you do I'll take anybody yeah I
mean I have I have basic criteria I asked like a couple of questions I mean honestly the main
criteria that I have for people that I accept is I just need to know that they want to learn
they have an open mind and they're creative everything else I can more or less teach you I
can give you the resources necessary to do it and as long as you're working hard on your own
reading and going through the material we'll get where we need to go but the thing that you need
is the desire to find that truth just like when it comes to arguing and discussing yeah if I'm
more interested in you giving me the knowledge or me just telling you what I think rather than
just like a genuine intellectual honesty like let's just find out what the truth is your feelings my
feelings who cares bro let's just learn it right yeah once we get there we'll start making some
progress so yeah my fiance now we're just talking on the way here actually she was she watched some
movie about gender issues right about the transgender this guy wanted to be a woman and
then he went got the surgery and it was like how it works and going through this whole thing
and then she now we're just like going back and forth about the pros and the cons and
whether it's good whether it's bad and how people think about it and then in the end we ended up
sort of agreeing that the only way it's going to get better is when people are just more interested
in understanding how things work rather than just sort of espousing their ideas and we're like well
you know we can either fix that problem like fix racism or just fix its symptoms and we're like
well you can't just fix racism so let's fix the symptoms and it's exactly what you're saying right
now you're like well yeah we're trying to fix the symptoms but the the real source of the problem
is the fact that people just aren't interested in finding the truth and so you say how do we fix it
and what she and I said in that moment was this podcast just talking about it just making people
just making people aware of it and she was really excited that I was coming here to talk about this
stuff because hopefully some people are gonna watch this and then you know what maybe maybe
that's true and yeah maybe they'll do a little more reading and try and find some resources to
deepen their knowledge about the things that they actually think just question what it is that you
believe and why you believe it you know make sure you can prove to yourself beyond a shadow of a doubt
that you believe it keep trying to prove it wrong always and then if you prove it wrong be willing
to let it go right and then find something that's new and more consistent with reality do you think
there uh do you think there is any kind of solution to something like racism so people come over I
have a dog his name is hero he's Nikita and he's awesome and he's he's what he's awesome Nikita oh Akita
Akita Akita let's have a dog yeah it's a Japanese it's an American he's a Japanese dog well Japanese
mixed with Mastiff and German Shepherd and he's everybody loves him I take him to the park I take
him to get is he was voted like pet of the month in Tallahassee he's like a little samurai soldier
badass dude he's just awesome and people frequently ask me you know uh how did you train him so well
etc why how was he so well behaved and obviously some of it I was just lucky because he has just
a disposition that's amenable and easy to to train but one in particular question is when they come
over and I like a big open layout and I have company and I'm entertaining guests maybe I'm cooking or
something or I drop like chicken on the floor yeah and he's just like sleeping in the kitchen
or in in the living room just like totally oblivious like how did you teach him not to beg
and they're just like blowing away like it's just so nice not having him sitting there just like
begging all the time how'd you teach him that and I go I never taught him not to beg I never taught
him to beg right like what am I talking about well the issue is is that when I'm sitting down the
kitchen and my dog is like walking by and I see this like all he'd like that well I just want to
make him happy you know come your spot and then you just like give him a little treat right there
and this dog's like oh so when you're in here you doing this then that means I can get food this
this is a thing okay and now every time you're in there cooking they're like oh they're in is this
food thing gonna happen again maybe if I just sit here I'll get some food and then you see me
like oh look at those eyes and then you give him a treat and and now he just keeps coming back and
suddenly he's like this is a thing like I come here and I get this food I love this thing let's do
this thing more and so your this relates in my opinion to the idea of racism because how do you
fix racism well you never teach it in the first place that's how you fix it okay you just it's
it should be a thing that in the ideal dream world there should be no black history month white
history month because all you're doing is reminding them of a thing that we should never hit even be
discussed in the first place like it shouldn't even be an intellectual consideration in the ideal
world like the idea that they could ever even be unequal should just be preposterous you're just
like well I don't understand how that it was ever a thing and just reminding them to think about it
is giving the option the unnecessary option for one or two crazy people to take it off and make
unnecessary things happen so right and it's become so bad that there's people that are
for example white who hate other white people because of the you know like like antifa like the
far far far left people when you think everybody else is so racist and you have to fix the problem
so you have to go to this you know extreme level to wear a mask and march on the street and beat
the shit out of people because they're white and you're also white I think the where I see that
for example is like let's just imagine we've got a meter here of equality if we will and it's sort
of swinging back and forth for whatever reason and let's say it's sitting over here in the middle
would be this nice happy equality and we're sitting way over here where things are pretty much
unequal right and everybody's like most people we got to do something about this this just isn't
the way things should be so how do we make it better should be should be yeah I have an interesting
little quote that I'm learning to adopt more and I it is my quote is there is no should there is only
could hmm yeah so um but so here we are and here's this arrow and so people are saying it should
be closer to the middle is what a lot of people say and the problem in my opinion is that people
justify anything that moves the arrow in the opposite direction as being okay
but there are clearly examples where it goes well past the equality and all the way to the other side
right and so they misunderstand that I mean I can give an obvious extreme example you know so one
of the things we talked about last time was when you're trying to understand new ideas push them to
zero and push them to infinity to see when they break so you understand the constraints of your
idea because nothing is perfect so what's this idea well let's say gender inequality okay well
you know a good way to make sure that women are treated better well I don't just get rid of all the
men okay right and it's a clearly obnoxious example but it just demonstrates how maybe the needle's
too far over here and yes what this thing would do is move it towards equality because there would
be no more men women would just be optimal it moved in the opposite direction but it went so far
that there were just no more men right so that I think is sort of the source of this like antifa
thing you see that happening a lot where people feel very and I've spoken with a lot of these people
and have you yeah and it's sad man people that are associate with antifa not antifa in particular
excuse me I just meant the these people who are who see the arrow going in the other direction like
no matter how far it goes it's justified okay they're not like intentionally evil or malicious
or anything they just feel really violated just oppressed they just feel really unjustly treated
and they they just want they want to find happiness they want to find contentment they want to belong
they want to feel like they have opportunities to thrive and succeed okay and so those feelings
they're neither right nor wrong they're just a thing that we all have and they should be respected
because everybody has those in fact I would die for their right to have them because I enjoy the
privilege of having them myself and I think we should all be able to have them right so
and so when you see sort of where it's coming from it's hard to sort of argue against it when
you're there and you're feeling it you know we talk about those three things the emotional
arguments are very persuasive you know we're humans these things sway us strongly and so you see
you know here's this here's this little gauge and anything that moves it in the other direction
you know seems pretty justified and it's hard to find that line between where it's okay to do this
but now we've gone too far let's pass a law that makes us have to hire all the same people that's
fine let's pass a law that says we have to pay them more than that we paid other people to
justify and give them reparations for past treatment or something maybe we're going a little too far
because now they need a little swing in the opposite direction and then we might get the
reverse problem which may or may not be justified depending on who you ask right so it gets it's
pretty hairy yeah that's that's fucking almost impossible to navigate depending on depending
on the issue that you're talking about my solution once again is always the same thing man like if
we are just more interested in finding the truth of these things and rather than being right and
convincing others of our own ideas you know these antifa people wouldn't need to go fight and be
revolutionaries if the people they were fighting were interested in hearing their ideas and cared
about what they cared about and wanted to try and find some equal ground where everybody was happy
there was this mutual respect this mutual understanding yeah it's an ideal world like a little utopia
thing but i don't think it's as outlandish as it seems all it takes is just everyone takes a little
individual responsibility over time over a couple of generations and then suddenly you find that our
culture and community is just much more intrinsically tolerant that's what education should be for
we just teach people to be tolerant i agree and it's easy to be tolerant when you've been subjected
to many different things which is why oftentimes the university crowd are particularly more liberal
because they go to a university where there's all kinds of races and genders and they're young
enough to still be impressionable and so they're not firm in their convictions and suddenly now
they're surrounded by all different kinds of people and everyone is nice all their friends are nice
and it's just simply different so right you're raised in this environment and so you're just
intrinsically tolerant because that's just the way it was and so thinking seeing anything otherwise
is just baffling right yeah why would this why would i know these people these people are great
people why do you hate these people right yeah the scary thing also about things like antifa is that
it's just kind of it's like instigating the same thing on the complete other end of the spectrum
you know what i mean it's almost like come on bring it on you know what i mean like like those
people just the fact that they exist and what they're doing almost kind of like inspires that to
happen on the far opposite end and that's terrifying what would you do about it danie i don't know
what i would do nathan i'm just a i'm just a dummy who asks questions chain what would you do about
this about what antifa i don't even know what antifa good for you man like i'm yeah i envy that
yeah honestly yeah just work he just ate he just ate like how many milligrams was that cookie you ate
it's like 20 30 is that a lot no no i like cookies yeah fall had some
just talking yeah i have also to talk a i what can we talk about a i all right so
all right listen everybody machine learning is not artificial intelligence we are nowhere close
to artificial intelligence these things that you see that are very impressive that can do
allegedly human level things better than humans are just glorified calculators guess guess what else
they can do better than humans multiply numbers together we've never been scared of our calculators
there's no reason to be a scared of machine learning because the algorithm that's able to
identify certain scribbles and pixels as being a letter isn't going to suddenly
walk outside and learn to play basketball and then feel subjected or subject they feel like
oppressed by your government or how you treated them and then turn around and do your taxes for
you right so that's not going to happen artificial intelligence is at least the general AI as we
like to call it our human level artificial intelligence we are so far away from that that's
not going to be happening anytime soon how far away is that yeah yeah sorry so to be precise
what what it really means is we have no idea how to even do it so theoretically it could be
next year if some you know landmark paper and some crazy guy in a garage comes out with some
things that some new ideas that we've never thought of right the could be as soon as that
what i mean though is that there's no like slowly building body of knowledge that we've been observing
over time or we can now make a reasonable prediction about the future like we're getting
better and better at this we have no idea it seems like there's one just like one
missing piece to it because it's like we're building the brain like google's the brain
google is like collective consciousness of everybody on the earth right like all the
questions that people ask all these podcasts all this information input that's going into this
google brain it's almost like there's just one little button that needs to be pushed to turn
into a fucking not at all man and here's why it's right is because you have all of this data there
right nobody knows what the hell to do with it right so with all of this data what they do is
they go okay let's write this algorithm that you know how to make money with it they know how to
do that very well they say let's let's take all this data and all these videos and let's pass
them through this neural network so that we can identify the collection of pixels that resemble
a cat okay that's not artificial intelligence that's just object recognition right all right
or you know there are some research avenues which are a bit more promising than others like
reinforcement learning which is this idea that rather than just giving some clear objective
function and then training some network to do this one task really well what you do is you
basically say here go do this thing and I'm going to reward you when you do it well or discourage
you when you don't do it well whatever it is and it'll learn what it should do based on the rewards
that you give it over time and the reinforcements that you give it over time that's the field of
reinforcement learning but even that you know that's been around for a while but even that isn't
doing particularly well so for example there's a lot of really interesting things that have
happened so let's say that you create a spider robot and you give it a reinforcement learning
algorithm that says I want you to um eat humans that's an undesirable one but terrifying one
yeah thankfully these spiders were just in a simulation on a computer so they weren't real
oh so yeah maybe we can give them that I thought you were talking about like an actual one
like giant metal spider or something that'd be pretty gnarly yeah yeah so these are these are
little simulated robots in like a little simulation environment you basically say I want you to travel
as far as you can by minimizing the amount of time that your little feet hit the ground
what do you think it's going to learn to do like what sort of behavior does it learn to do
well what it learned to do was to flip over on its back and like walk on its little elbows
it minimized the time it achieved zero time wow right so this is the another one so you can say
for example there's a robotic arm and they wanted to teach it to like stack blocks so they basically
said okay I'm going to reward you so when you pick up this block I'm going to reward you by how far
away the bottom of this block is from the ground and so it can learn to like maybe just stack things
that was like like this fundamental idea if we just give it this this notion so what did it learn to
do it just learned to flip all the blocks over because the bottom of the blocks were a the the
width of the block away and then you add all of those up for all the blocks that's a pretty big
number right right right right wow right so this is the idea that even reinforcement learning like
when you give it an objective or you give it this like esoteric goal that you'd like to reinforce
it for you have no idea what it's going to learn to do and oftentimes these things are
relatively creative you know so you might call this like creativity well creativity then is just
some local minimum some objective cost function that achieves an unexpected result you know that's
that's really all it is but that's fine so be it what is creativity can you teach an AI or a robot
creativity well that that's essentially what it is right so if you give it an objective here's
this cost function and you constrain its ability to solve this problem and it still solves it right
that's basically creativity that is creativity which is flipping over on your elbows and walking
around or flipping these blocks over it's like a way that we wouldn't have thought about solving this
problem holy shit but that's not impressive because it didn't demonstrate any like superior
intelligence to be clever about this all it did is just found a local minimum some which is what
it would have done anyways if you didn't constrain it so much literally all it's doing is just finding
a minima all right so what do I mean by that you know what I'm saying what I mean by that
here's the cost function and if you're over here it costs more and if you're over here it costs
more and so you want to find the set of parameters that bring you down here yeah yeah okay so that's
that's basically what that means and everything in machine learning is just minimizing cost functions
and it's just really big computers really big data sets and you're just minimizing a cost function
to do really cool things but it's not intelligence it's not artificial intelligence it's just a
calculator it's a really big fancy super expensive calculator right for now for now and what would
turn that calculator into a giant killing machine that would threaten humanity like what would it
take like how far away is a threat like that like legitimately everyone everyone has a different
opinion on it like Elon Musk always says that you know it's a huge threat we need to start putting
regulations in place now for companies like Boston what is it called Boston Robotics or uh yeah you
know companies like that like he's like super terrified he makes it seem like it's we're right
on the horizon of something like that as the other people who don't yeah all right so whether
his concerns are justified or not in as much as like assume ai does exist perhaps what he's
saying is pretty reasonable right you know we do want to make sure that if we're gonna do this thing
we do it wisely we do it intelligently we understand the problem we consider it enough
into the future and its consequences and everything to regulate it in a reasonable way
but he doesn't do research in the field and he's he doesn't this isn't his thing we're nowhere near
as close to it as he says or thinks we are right okay so um and this isn't I mean you can trust me
if you want or you can just go read all the research papers that have been published at like
the past three leading conferences and machine learning and they're all doing the same thing
I got 0.1 percent more improvement in this MNIST dataset or I just did a super big jumbo buy
GAN network I connected three generative adversarial networks and it's not it's not artificial
intelligence it's mostly just pushing forward incrementally in like a little rabbit hole of
optimization that isn't what true artificial intelligence is really about okay right so
basically you're saying how far away are we from it well what I would say to that is
if we're following the route that we are going it's nowhere in the foreseeable future right
because this isn't the way that we're going to get to these things in general we need to break
through like a completely new approach to how to go about solving this what kind of approach would
that be in your that's my research and that's what I'm interested in right so that's what I work on
so the way that I describe it is as follows right so artificial neural networks currently
machine learning the thing that everybody calls AI is you have a big box call it your neural
network okay who cares how it works and you have this cost function this objective this thing you're
trying to tell it to do label cats better so basically a goal a goal right and so all you do is
you give it a thing this thing that you'd like it to behave on and then you measure how well it
behaved and then you say okay well you didn't do that well so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
update all of the the I'm going to update the neural network such that the next time I present
the same thing to you you do this job better okay that's machine learning in a nutshell okay okay
the problem it's getting better every time yes but what you do is you say here's an objective
here's this thing and get better at doing this over time this that's machine learning in a nutshell
the problem is this is top down okay so what this means is that we have defined this objective
function for the neural network and then we're trying to get it to learn to do this task that
we want it to do that's not how intelligence came about right our intelligence is self-organizing
and emergent we our intelligence is bottom up we have a bunch of little neurons that are just
randomly presented with some stimulus from the environment photons waves pressure waves coming
and bending the little hairs in our ears electromagnetic fields etc and it comes into our
nervous system and our neurons at the bottom level just slowly start adapting to process and
identify this input right and so they're sort of self-organizing in the sense that the updates
that they have at this level are local and then over time as you keep presenting more and more
information these things start combining hierarchically until what we call intelligence this
sort of behavior which a couple of things that we classify as being intelligent emerges as a
property so machine learning is top down I understand we need to be doing bottom up
and the reason that's really difficult is because we have to let go of being in control
right so because for what we like to do say here's an objective function do this one thing well
and the neural network learns to do it and that's fine that's not intelligence which is why we're
never going to get towards like AI with this what we need to do is say let's get thousands and millions
of neurons and give them these small little rules and connect them together in some way that allows
them to adapt and then just present it with information and then it's going to self organize
into a way that it processes the information that's useful and behaves in a way that allows it to
survive and do things that we don't really know what it's going to do we have to let go of that
objective behavior that we're always seeking in science so we're always going to be objective
about things but I don't think that I mean this is a new why would the human race ever want to do
that well because we want to understand ourselves at the potential cost of destroying ourselves
like aren't obviously people are afraid of if we create something bigger more advanced than we are
we'll just become pets yeah here's the thing I mean that's the thought process right I mean
that that's what you have to be okay with that if something like that were to happen but that's
one of infinitely many possible futures what if it comes to be benevolent and loves everyone and
wants to make our lives better or what if maybe it does subjugate us but saves us from global
warming and starvation I mean so for example people don't really like the owning of animals
and they say oh well you shouldn't own animals or pets let them live out in the wild maybe that's
the case but if their argument is because they're happier out there that's not as obvious anymore
I mean my dog is pretty happy I treat him well we exercise all the time he loves people he gets
scratches he would never receive anywhere near that much just fulfillment out in nature right
is that good or is it bad I don't know maybe he didn't have the opportunity and we shouldn't
have taken it away from him I don't know that's an argument I'm but if it comes to pure happiness
he's pretty happy so what if these AI come about and they're super intelligent and they treat us
like little pets and they just keep us in little palaces where we have infinite food and happiness
and we can just explore and read books and just play music and have sex and just be be merry I don't
know are you really against that maybe they're they're we're just pets and they're like oh look
at they're having sex that's cute wow I've never heard of it I've never heard of it described that
way but here's the thing is what I just proposed is just as plausible as whatever sort of future
that we imagine right the problem is that they're all equally possible because we have no idea what
would happen people tend to jump towards the immediately scary things because we have an
inclination to do that right but we have no evidence to suggest it is by definition beyond
our ability to understand like how would we dare presume how it would think if it's beyond us in
our intelligence yeah I mean you know what I mean it's like it's purely speculation at that point
why immediately jump to the one scary thing out of the infinitely many possible explanations
why is that the only one that everyone's obsessed with yeah I don't like horror movies my problem
with horror movies is that they're scary why do people like scary things dude they just they just
do it's a it's a I don't know anime is awesome too anime is awesome I love anime do you watch
Trigun yet no I haven't I need to this interview is over what time is it how long we've been on
this motherfucking interview how long has this been going or fall hour 36 hour 36 hours flying
through it and that's almost like two hours and something I think that's a good one I don't
feel satisfied did we cover I think we covered a lot of really really good shit would you get that uh
that microchip Elon wants to put in your brain god no he has here's the thing man oh the neural
link listen man go and read the research coming out of that place like look at the papers and the
things that they're publishing he's like talking about doing human experiments they are so far away
from being remotely capable of doing what he says that it's capable of doing it's basically a
publicity stunt there's no research to suggest and here's the thing really okay there's always
hypothetical scenarios and you can say this is a theoretical approach of how this might be solved
etc etc but here's the thing right Elon Musk is one person he's hired a couple a couple dozen pretty
smart um neuroscientist and researchers there's hundreds and thousands of them all over the globe
all trying to do the same thing so the question is why is it that suddenly he and his guys are
going to come up with an approach that all of the other people around the whole globe is saying
isn't really possible right now we know the state of the art we know the technology we're really far
from being able to do this why is it that we should suddenly believe that just he and his small
team of people who've put out a few papers that have demonstrated you know maybe some interesting
ideas but nothing even remotely close to putting a chip in our brain that's going to be able to
interface with our thoughts and do the things that he's promising right hasn't tried it on anybody
no i mean they just recently said that he's gonna try human trials
soon on medical patient or patient patients that need it for medical reasons right i didn't read
the full article i just read it and then i immediately went to look at the research because
i was like well he's gonna do this research must have been coming along and i find research like
this uh go to google scholar i mean that's the best scholar start from okay yeah that's a great
place to start from um and then usually you go to their websites and then they'll have like blogs
or have the research section like you go to open ai and then they have their research you go to google
ai and then they have their whole research section okay and even in uh newside we're actually working
on a new website right now labs dot newside dot ai where we will start exposing um some of our
research internally we'll make some blog post sharing some of the things that we've been doing
okay so that's how you can go to the company and oftentimes they expose their research because
so why why do you think he he's doing this big publicity stunt about neuro link and being able
to just to so i mean obviously the the goal of it is just to be able to seamlessly connect with any
kind of like cellular like like your your phone or your computer with just thinking about it right
like thinking about sending a text and you can do it or what if you can do it yeah okay so a
couple things great question firstly um i'm not saying that it is a publicity stunt i'm saying
that it probably would be given the fact that i am pretty sure that we're not really close to
being capable of doing these things okay that being said i would never want to discourage somebody
from trying right so there's a difference between sort of being realistic and then just being oppressive
and just being a you know a party pooper right so and for all i know maybe he believes that they
can and he just and maybe it's his sheer believing in the way makes the way mentality that allows
him to bring these companies about because he just simply believes in the impossible enough
that he brings people together and makes these crazy things happen and maybe it will and that'd
be great and exciting however uh statistically speaking at least as far as the technology
that we're aware and people trying to do these things in the past that's not probable um so and
what if he does do it yeah if you prove that it worked would you get one would i get one
yeah that's a that's an interesting question they gotta drill a hole in your skull yeah no i wouldn't
yeah not yet because that's um it's way too early in the prototype but there'd be mistakes
and accidents and what you're interfacing with uh i would wait until it became much more well
established i'd research it much more thoroughly and i could see danny get one i think elon should
be the first one to do it i like that yeah i mean police officers have to get maced before they can
mace other people it's only fair yeah right yeah that is only fair he should be the first one to
do it did you imagine him on on one of those narrow links and it actually worked what is it what
does it worked means i'm not really even sure elon musk is is running around a fucking you know
inventing things on ten times the level he is right now you know that'd be crazy you think elon musk
invents these things he doesn't invent them but he's a huge teams of of researchers and and um
um people like yourself machine learning experts and uh and scientists and people that are doing
that i mean he has a whole army of people like that that are trying to i think he just from what
his interview say he just comes up with simple ideas and then has them execute it like the the
tunnel idea like he said i hated la traffic all right dig tunnels a couple of things firstly the
tunnel idea it's not a very good one all right so that's just not really or maybe it's a good idea
but it is not working in that company the whole like boring thing why why because it was nothing
that he remotely promised it's like basically a car on a on a it's a train it's a train tunnel
it's what it is it's it's and i'm not even a very good one right but your car is supposed to sit on
like a skateboard right and it shoots your car through a tunnel under underneath the city yeah
that's what he promised isn't it no he feels like this hyper rails hyper loop thing and he had
no that's different the hyper loop's different right i think the hyper loop is completely different
than the boat than the than the tunnels well here's the idea in my mind that's kind of ill on
musk right he's like audio these ideas and they sort of just he says these things and gets money
and then it sort of like formulates into a thing and then he's really good at getting money right
yeah so but here's the thing right you just said he comes up with these ideas the simple ideas and
then gets people together to do it well right good ideas are a dime a dozen like everybody could
just sit back and just smoke a joint drink a beer be like wouldn't it be cool if we all had chips in
our brains that let us interface with computers that'd be pretty neat i mean everybody's thought
of that that isn't an impressive thing what's impressive is the ability to actually carry it
out having the wherewithal the intelligence the resources the discipline to actually do the
hard work for years and years and years and carry it out that in my opinion is what deserves respect
not the people who come up with the ideas but the people who actually make it happen but i mean
there's also you know the guys like him who who innovate it and make it all happen and bring
everyone together and organize it all into one place and bring in the money you bring in the
experts and go on a fucking giant podcast and let everyone know about it so now you have all
this attention surrounding you and i agree with that you can make it happen i agree with that
my initial my initial calm was when you said he goes around inventing things right right that was
when you like watch his podcast he i mean he's like yeah did you watch it yeah what'd you think
about it i wasn't impressed i i felt like he was a little conceded in almost almost in a uh like
a trying to convince people away he's like yeah i've got all these ideas it's like constant
explosions in my brain it's very very it's very hard to explain yeah it's like people don't people
who are smart don't talk like that like to think about the really intelligent impressive people
that you've respected they usually don't like tell you how smart they are and try to like
convince you with these weird descriptions you know yeah i mean wow that was a fucking solid
hour and 45 minutes nathan i always enjoyed chatting with you guys man that was really cool
i learned i don't i learned a shitload yeah i feel like i attended a whole class today we
did good and it's free and everyone can learn if they want they don't have to pay not a dime
there you go cool man well thanks again and uh hopefully if we'll get you on here again soon
and enjoy your trip to europe i'm gonna have a blast blast this is gonna be great we're gonna
climb mount tayday dude it's gonna be great mount what mount tayday it's the highest peak in spain
really yeah i'm excited damn i brought a i brought a laser pointer for the stars and we're just gonna
like point out the stars i'm gonna pretend like i know like constellations and try and impress people
really look look at all these stars over here i could tell them about it but that's like constant
explosions in my brain it's too difficult for you to understand nathan musk everybody thanks man my
pleasure cheers
