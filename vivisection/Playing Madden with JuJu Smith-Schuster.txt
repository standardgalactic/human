Let me know what you think about this video, and I'll see you in the next one.
It's just like macro in the camera with coconut milk.
Wow, kicking it off.
Oh, can't let my taste of this be true, bro.
Alright, let's go.
So you know their playbook?
Yeah, I know their playbook because that's all I play.

When I'm gaming like video games?
Yeah.
I'll type some music, a little pump.
Everything and everything.
Just gotta pick.
Not a good start.
I just got picked on the second play of the game.
I listen to all type of music.
When I'm gaming, something that's always up to beat like tempo, like keep me hype.
You listen to a lot of music before games and stuff?
Out.
Are you kidding me?
It's so funny because man doesn't let us listen to our speakers out loud.
Who doesn't?
Big man.
Really?
He doesn't like it.
What kind of music has it been like?
I don't know what type of music he listens to, but for sure something I probably listen to.
Probably likes country.
You see what we got going on here.
This is what I do bro.
I'm already in the red zone.

What's your favorite Travis Scott song?
Butterfly Fate.

B's in the trap.
I'm only in cover four right now.
B's in the trap.
There's no way.
Oh, the juice.
The juice is loose.
He did that.
He did that.
That's crazy to actually play there.
Look, I'm like right there.
I know, right?
Oh yeah, I picked pretty soon.

Marty B.
What do you do?
You just lurk in the center the whole time?
Throw in the fat.

What am I doing?
Ooh!
Oh, dang!
Honestly, probably Gucci.
Ooh, what's this?
Okay.
Thank you very much.
That's delicious.
The distraction, mom. The distraction.
It's alright.
It's just what I needed.
Thank you.
Fourth and three.
Going for it?
Going for it.
No!
It's back in the third grade.
We lost to the full 40 yards.
And now it's second down.
It's alright, man.
Oh, my God, dude.
Get him to the flat.
Don't give me to the flat.
That's what Tomlin says to you.
That's what Tomlin says to you?
No, that's what he says to our defense.
So, when we're in the huddle, and we're like driving out,
like, we've got like five, like four games,
so we got to come back.
Right, right.
Then, like, then we'll be like,
alright, we've done this before,
like, this thing out here is for me.
Like, we're in the huddle.
Like, he's so calm in the huddle.
Really?
Yeah, like a mango game.
Yeah.
Like, I got a penalty.
50 yards back.
And, like,
it makes you know, like, the next play, like,
you got these balls for, like, almost 20 yards.
Like, now we're just driving down,
and being ready to score.
Yeah.
When you score a tie to game,
and then you drive down again,
and you can go the win, and go home.
That's crazy, bro.
What is it, like, what is it about,
like, do you know in the huddles,
like, who the, like,
like, do you or AB, like, in the ball,
like, throw me the ball, like, throw me the ball.
Like, do you always know where the ball's going to go, or is it?
Like, after a time, like, when they do, like,
when you throw the ball at AB, it's like...
Yeah, some of those catches are crazy.
Like, that one against this helmet.
I think they need to mic you up,
do one of those mic'd up videos on you.
Why not?
You talk too much mess?
Nah.
You talk a lot, you talk a lot of smack, or no?
Nah.
I'm funny.
I'm not lying all that day.
No!
You guys, like, love this formation, bro.
I do, it's only what I know.
I usually win by only playing this formation.
But, I don't know.
I haven't watched any new YouTube videos lately about...
Man.
Yeah.
Who's your favorite quarterback?
I mean, obviously, besides Ben.
I can't say.
You can't say?
Come on.
Dude, I met Aaron Rodgers.
Yeah.
Who?
I like him, though.
I like him a lot.
Have you played him yet?
You played against the team, but he wasn't.
What was he like?
I was about to.
Can you tell what I'm going to do right here?
You're going to try it.
Touchdown.
Touchdown.
No way.
You left me way too much time.
No.
Game over.
There's no way.
Are you kidding me?
I told you, you left me way too much time.
Good game, bro.
You destroyed me.
But, at least I got this delicious drink.
So, what did I do wrong, bro?
Give me some pointers so I can meet some more people online.
I'm playing the same play too much?
Same formation?
Yeah.
You see, like, what type of defense the guy's playing?
Yeah.
Like, I noticed you were playing like...
Yeah, last play, like, I got that first down, like,
oh, you mean cover four?
I'm going back to my old play.
You mean cover four, like, split down in the middle?
Yeah.
But, yeah, I mean, you got to change your game play.
Like, notice what they're playing.
And once you notice what they're playing,
you know what you got to beat them.
Yeah.
That's how I see it.
Yeah.
You got to join the NFL.
I definitely got to switch it up.
Yeah.
I might have a chance.
Maybe one day I could be a kicker or something.
Yeah.
