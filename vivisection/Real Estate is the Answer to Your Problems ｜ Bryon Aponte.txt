really open her up like we should have you gotta be humble i feel like we gotta do uh take two
that life is tough bro you gotta be humble because you gotta attract the crowd yeah but i don't
think being humble attracts the crowd right being ignorant attracts the crowd yeah but that's
stupid money you need real money you want to spit it to reality get a little bit closer people respect
real stuff that makes real money when you get ignorant you're just showing the the side of you
that wants to bring in the crowd that doesn't really want to make money
what about like jake paul and logan paul those guys know how to make money and all they do is talk
shit fucking yeah they're pissed up you know what i mean i'm too old for that you think jake paul's
gonna be able to knock out floyd mayweather or our logan paul rather i think mayweather's gonna get
122 million dollars that company didn't respect his honor you think he's gonna get that much fucking
money 122 million of them right boxing's changed i'm a big boxing fan and um it's just like glorified
rat race not jobs you know how it is yeah we could talk boxing all day but i can't i can't
freak with today's boxing no that's no it's not it's not reality it's just like who can i
connor mcgregor what do you make a hundred million i have no idea how he fought he made a lot right
so you got guys that are not really boxers they're like andre the giant and whole kogan yeah and
rocky coming up yeah hmm yeah it's a different game nowadays they're all trying to uh just get
more followers and they're trying to parlay their social media following into boxing yeah what i
noticed it works though because it's like it's because it sells tickets right box is all about
selling tickets isn't it everything is um it's all about making money who wants to go get knocked out
for free everything's about entertaining yeah it's all about my tyson when he fought buster douglas
he had to go to japan to fight down did you watch that fight of course i watched all my tyson's
fights did you and my favorite one was when he beat michael spinks in 91 seconds michael spinks beat
larry holmes twice and then he came to the came to the grim reaper took him down real quick damn
mike tyson savage dude so what's up man what are you been doing you've been making money or what
of course i just been messing with my uh my new construction you know i see that crypto was like
trampoline yesterday i love it you know you just gotta see what's popping dump it when it's high
keep coming back so you own any right now did you buy the dip i always buy the dip because that's where
the paper's at but the dip keeps getting deeper well when you got a guy like musk on saturday
ain't live i'm looking for john blushee and gilda radner and then i see this dude and i'm like oh my
god let me go to sleep everything is crazy now you know what i mean yeah he's a fucking weirdo
but you know what he's the only guy that i know that it's never made a dime in his company's worth
what 500 a share times five he did split last year so he's making he's making a killing how's
the tesla stock treating you i think it's about 550 maybe uh you know last year before the um after
the uh this covid i think it dropped to 380 so then um it split five times so now it's worth 2,500
off last year's price i guess it's all right how much you hold on a few but the things that
i told you from the last time stocks and bitcoin and all that that's like a hobby
my thing is real estate i want to teach people how to make money with real estate right because
what else is there cattle gold and real estate cattle the fuck who makes money on cattle people
who have a lot of land in okala and they green belt it they make money on cattle i thought texas
was the cattle capital you know what and uh bill gates is trying to get rid of cattle bill when
they fart destroys the ozone oh yeah it's true i heard that that's true i don't own any cattle but i
see cattle cattle real estate and gold that's what i think the um the solid investments are
what about trading cards baseball cards of course vintage like i told you the last time
dr newman he uh he was a big collector in tamper he just died recently i sold him a lot of cards
did you yeah his car he's lived on david's side his father used to own the largest rose
Royce collection so when you see dr newman when you see his collection look at his father so he
owned the largest real rose Royce collection in the history of the world but you know the cards
is where the money's at you know don't get it twisted with new stuff you want to stick to the
old cards tycobe baybruth lou gary jody maggio mickey mantel stuff like that are you day trading
cards are you holding them long term now i buy and sell on ebay i go to the shows i do what i can
and i like to just i take a lot of my real estate money and just throw it in the card game because
the real estate is cool and you make money but the cards is fun you're buying the nft cards
i don't see any value in that you know you look at a computer screen you pay 68 some people are
making a lot of money on that it's like uh no i see that you know that's a you're like rob grunkowski
i mean that's a heavily highly manipulated product i just don't see that making money in the long
term yeah i think i think the old cards is where the money's at yeah but really like i told you i
like to talk about real estate because everybody in the world is involved in real estate i like to
school people for free i know a lot of people who make money i'm charging thousands of dollars for
classes i mean you know the last time we did uh we did a little podcast and i i read the comments
and i appreciate everybody's comments and i've seen a couple negative comments i just like to touch
that i've seen one guy was like hey look even if you pay cash you can't close a house in a day
that's not true i mean maybe we could touch on stuff like that yeah we could pull some up yeah
definitely please so let me tell you how you buy a house in a day for the non-believers aid and
there's a uh podcast we did with brian a couple weeks ago you can find it just google brian aponte
concrete and you'll find it pull up the comments on the tv yeah so basically how you buy a house in
one day a lot of people who deal with real estate they're not actually closers they're pretenders
because i'll tell you how the real estate game works there's three type of buyers you have a buyer
a pretender and a borrower so the borrower has to beg daddy to buy the house so he has to either
call a bank or deal with the appraisers to so he can be allowed well let's i mean let's be
on let's be fair here most people are borrowers most normal people in the real world are bought
have to borrow money from a bank yeah you're you're 100 correct but we're not talking to
about most of the people we're not talking about the sheep we're talking well the people that are
watching this are most you have to understand people that are watching them in the game how to
make real money okay the next time i come i'll bring you like a thousand hud's minimum so you
can see what i do all right but how you buy a house in one day for the people who don't understand
the business let's pretend that you are a wholesaler and you have a house and a guy let's pretend
you're next door neighbor what's a wholesaler first of all a wholesaler is a guy who's in the
business who doesn't want to close he just wants to assign his contract so what that means is let's
pretend this phone is a contract so you have a house for sale so you want to sell a house for
a hundred thousand dollars okay he gets the contract and he gets a he gets an inspection
period right so an inspection period in other terms is like let me get a few days or a couple
weeks so i can market your property right to sell to a real buyer so they go to a title company
and the title work starts going they do they check for mortgages they check for liens and blah
blah blah so once the title company tells you yo the property is ready to go so you got a contract
for a hundred grand let's just say yeah so you want to push it on the street because you don't
have any money but you want to make money because you brought the deal right so then
you come and you push it around the block you email blast it you do whatever you got to do
you're pushing it for 120 130 whatever you think you could get based on what it's worth
so when that doesn't work they call a guy like me hey brian i got a day left i got to close it
where you closing at they give me the name of the title company send me the title commitment look at
the title commitment boom all right send me the underlining contract so i look at the underlining
contract i see what they're paying i see everything so i go look at it so in tampa florida where i live
i know every street in town so i already know what it's worth before i get there so you're buying
it for a hundred and i said cool i'll give you a buck ten so it's up to you to sell it to me or not
so you can make ten grand and you didn't really do not accept put up a deposit so i call the title
company and i call can this who runs my office can this wire the money get this hot boom so i go in
there i don't even have to go sign i do doctor sign because i'm a buyer i'm not a seller so they
don't need a notarized copy so i buy the house in two three minutes then what i do after i close
i give it to one of my team members so they can repush it so that is one thing i wanted to see
because when i read the comments let's look at these comments right here go right ahead i mean
these are positive man this man this man truly understands life and money you can tell by the
way he talks one other guy said yo brian stop making money it's all about smelling the roses
i'm 50 years old i've traveled the whole nation i bought sold it i've done everything
i've been to nascar wall series mba finals championship will you name it i've done it
so at the end of the day when i wake up at 4 30 in the morning what am i gonna do walk my dog
you know i'm saying i you know i do it but at the same time i want to have fun yeah but you're
you're addicted to doing this shit you're like the guy on uh the what's the fucking movie called
without it we talked about last time without i'm saying yeah gemstone gemstones exactly but the
problem with that movie it's very it's not realistic like we spoke about before no the reason it's not
realistic he had some gambling debts and he had millions of dollars with the scrap gold he could
have scrapped in less than 30 seconds at 98 percent of scrap so that movie makes no sense to me i love
how when he got he got that fucking uh that big snook delivered to his office that fish that was
full of uh full of diamonds all those rare stones that one fucking crazy greenstone blood diamonds
have you ever seen a blood diamond not really because when i get closer when i when i buy diamonds i
usually go to uh new york just pull put this thing in like you know what last time i looked like
like i was like hunchback this to sit up straight you got it anyway so the diamond game is tough
because there's more diamonds than people and the debir's company they own all the diamonds
so it's like a hush hush game yeah and then most of the diamonds that are retailed are trash
because the the best diamond obviously is an fld color flawless colorless but the diamond game
is tough because you gotta have you gotta have buyers and that's a job it's not like real estate
real estate it sells everywhere diamond sells to select people yeah everybody everybody can buy
real estate everybody needs real estate the one thing you can't well i don't know diamonds are
weird because i don't understand it quite i don't really understand it because it's the debir's
company they they manipulate it or they somehow control it's not like a it's not like a stock
pile and they slowly release they push them slowly the thing is there's a call the thing
called a rapper a rap report so it's like a wholesale thing on what the diamonds are worth
anything over a carrot which is a fl flaws d that has a high value and then you have different
colors different cuts so but the diamond game is like so super exposed and you got every rapper
movie star in the game china like outfloss each other even got people putting diamonds in their
heads yeah it's at the point now is this like yeah i'm not with this no more it doesn't even make sense
that's why i keep going i mess with the baseball cards yeah and the real estate because the
baseball cards are extremely rare and the real estate is this is a commodity that the most
expensive ones that guy from pits back right from the pirates that that most expensive
it's about honus wagner yeah there's actually one there's actually one percent the reason is
because he didn't believe in tobacco and that's a t206 card but you're extremely correct that's
the rarest card there's actually a couple up for sale yo this guy in the comments says i know a guy
won't mention his name he uses banks well a lot of people use his banks but i'm gonna tell you the
reason why i personally don't use banks you mean i use owner finance but i'm gonna tell you why i
don't use banks it's like this if you look at my track record right and you see that i bought
thousands of houses but i bought them in a day and sold them the same day i pushed them to hedge funds
it's like this let's say i'm buying a house that's worth two hundred thousand dollars by the time
a bank gives me that loan i already got it sold because i got to go get an appraisal i got to get
a survey who has time for that and if you got money in the bank to copy who cares because you're
already trying to repush it you know i'm saying if you're gonna buy it and retail it i mean those
days are over yeah you're a different breed though bro well you have to be a different breed if
you're like everybody else you ain't gonna get nowhere yeah that's true but no one can not everybody
can be like you man it's hustling not everybody everybody can be a hustler though see a lot of
people hustle different things some people hustle fish they they go fishing they pump the fish on
the block some people hustle retail you know they sell cars some people hustle fur coats back in the
day before you know the the people started shaking because it's not completely correct but everything
has a dollar trade value some people hustle drugs yeah but i never get into that because it doesn't
make sense there's less money in that you're gonna do a bid everybody's gonna get busted yeah that's
true but the bottom line is if you want to make money you have to have a good eye for what's out
there at the same time you have to know who your client is and you have to know how to buy
because like i told you from the rip you only make money when you buy you only realize when you sell
so what's the what's the best way if because right now the real estate market's fucking crazy
you go if you see a house for sale and you are interested and you want to go look at it
the day it goes on the market there's probably are going to be 10 offers on that house
so how do you get the how do you get the deal when there's so much competition for the deal
because you have to remember when it's up for sale it's already with a real estate agent
when it's with a real estate agent it's already retail because and then they're gonna shoot for
highest and best and if you have if you're a fHA buyer or if you're a um conventional loan buyer
they're gonna look at you last they only want to deal with cash buyers because they want to get out
of there right they don't want to fix it they don't want to do nothing but the problem is like if
you're in the city limits and you sell your house now the odds of you moving back are very very low
because the houses are going to go up 30 to 50 percent next year and i'll tell you why if you
want to know yeah why yeah i definitely want to know well because you have the liberal communist
in office right now and what they're looking to do is take 1031 exchanges away so basically with
1031 exchanges let's say you buy a apartment building for 10 million dollars or whatever
and then you reflip it and then you take that money and put it into a similar product they're
trying to take that away because they want to eat your money we said why the explain the tax you
want to explain i understand what 1031 exchanges i mean it makes a lot of sense it makes a lot of
sense for people that are employing ridiculous amounts of people to be able to to do that to
roll your your profit into new deals without paying tax on it it makes sense as an incentive
for people that always remember you're always paying tax no matter what right no no i know i
pay that hundreds of thousand dollars a year in real estate taxes no yeah for sure i completely
understand how it works you're paying a shitload of time you're paying tons of payroll taxes for
all your employees when you're running that big of an operation it's it makes sense as an incentive
to incentivize the people that have the balls to take those risks to buy those big ass fucking deals
so why would they want to remove that incentive what is that what is the logic
person not a political person and the reason is because that doesn't make me money it just
causes enemies because there's people on both sides of the fence trying to fight you but i'll
tell you my opinion the reason they need the money to pay for what they're with you know all the
things that's happening but i'm going to tell you why my thing is about real estate i'm going to tell
why the houses are going to go up and you could take this to the bank we are in hyper inflation
right now if you ever if you go out to eat no matter what you go with your girl you get a drink no
matter what is the worst place in Tampa or St. Pete whatever you can drop 100 dollars minimum
and they want to raise the minimum wage to 15 so you know what they did so what they did was they
started paying 300 a week plus 275 so that's 575 a week and if you make 15 an hour times 40 hours
at 600 minus taxes and blah blah blah so you're making more money to stay at home so basically
you're forcing a minimum wage hike right so now the real estate is a capital gains when you buy
and sell real estate you make capital gains not you're not working a job so if they raise the
capital gains and they eliminate 1031 exchanges nobody who has any brains or cash is going to
sell anything what they're going to do is they're going to build they're going to rent they're
going to refinance they're going to take all their equity out and they're going to rent Airbnb
or they're going to rent to regular section eight because section eight's going to go up
you know section eight you know where people get paid to live or nothing so all these all these
rents are going to skyrocket and the real estate will go up because you have less real estate to
sell that makes sense that makes total yeah well that's where the market's at but you want to be
in the city limits the money is always in the city here was a guy over here I just want to say
guys I live in a 400,000 house he doesn't even know where I live because 99% of my assets are in
trusts I just found that funny he said what some guy in a comment said that I live in a 400,000
house my funny thing is how does this guy know where I live it's irrelevant but I just found
that funny do you live in a $400,000 house? I got a 3,000 square foot house on a lake in a good
neighborhood keep scrolling but you know the guy who said that I want to buy a hundred of those for
600,000 bring them yeah I'm a cash buyer hurry up anyway I just wanted to touch on that
this this the type of guy who rips you off and then disrespects you after well first of all I don't
rip anybody off because I'm gonna tell you straight up and down when I do a deal I'm not gonna call
you on the phone I'm gonna look straight in your eyes I'm gonna look at your soul I'm gonna shake
your hand I'm gonna give you the money that you want it's either this you want my bread or you
want your product it doesn't matter to me because if you don't want to sell this other guy'll sell
to me and when you want to sell to me go shop it around because if you give it to a whole seller
they're gonna call me back anyway I think you need a vodka I've already had about 40 today I'll take
one why not I actually drink gray goose yeah why not let's get there I get you some I'm sorry I didn't
keep scrolling a little bit yeah um I got if you like this is uh this is sparkling water I like
this sparkling water it's good right liquid death like love death murder your thirst murder it gotta
murk them they got good slogans yeah it's always about that catchphrase right mm-hmm anyway how
about me what else we got what else we got let's see wow what an incredible interview this man it
has so much knowledge I really hope there's a part two of this interview well today's your lucky day
exactly so basically what I would like to do is I would like for you to ask me questions how I
could school people how to make money okay listen to this reality the most important thing about any
of this is for people to make money well check it out I mean we gotta make it we gotta we gotta make
it for like the average average work yeah so what if you don't have the money to put up look at this
guy let's use him let's use him as a test example I love this herringbone chain is about nine grams
it came out like a 1983 he has a crab lobster lock where let me see it it's a gams chain what's it
called herringbone herringbone yeah they stopped making them in the 80s because they were crimpel up
and then the hair on your chest so we could crimpel and take it off would burn you does it do that to
you oh yeah it gets caught on the chest hair all the time damn I don't fuck with chains if I do I'll
get the Cuban link though I get it Cuban links are the best they are the best bro all right let's use
him for an example he wants to buy a house all right tell him how he can buy it so ask him some
questions you want to buy to live there you want to buy to make money what are you looking to do
well I need to buy somewhere to live for sure but I'd like to make some money all right so what I
suggest is buy a lot and build it because you're gonna make money because think about it if I'm
buying lots and building and I'll make it 30 40 percent on my money so wouldn't it be better for
you to do the same thing well don't we have to don't we have to start like start from like
first of all where's he at the money to buy the lot well my point is if you have like a job and
you could get a loan but let's pretend you're broken you're a bum okay and you're driving a 1989
s1 s10 pickup yeah and you're pushing a lawnmower all right so what you need to do is you know
you need to learn the value of the houses and how you I tell everybody how you know how you get in
the game you ever see them them signs on the street we'll pay cash for your house yeah those guys know
more about real estate than anybody problem is they ain't got no money and you know why they're
just middleman in it right because the middleman knows everything right he knows the value he knows
the retail value he knows so you need to school him you need to get in his head you need to tell him
yo look I seen your sign what do you got so he gives you the address if you don't know the address
tell him okay why do you think I should buy this so you want to eat his brain why you should buy
what he got right so then you go over there and then you understand all right let me look up comps
let me look at Zillow let me see why this is what it is yeah all right so then when you know what's
the deal when you know the retail value and you know what it needs to get fixed you know what to
pay so then you ask him hey look even if you don't have anything for sale so you guess what I'm selling
the house where you know what my grandmother she got a house and she wants to give it to me so now
he's shaking because he's dying to rob you so now he's going to give you his time so you need to
learn from people who know what they're doing so once you know the hustle then you could get into
the game that's what I would tell you from the rip like if I didn't know yeah I like that if I'm if
I'm flipping burgers at Wendy's yeah and I and I want to get in the game I'm gonna call somebody
like that yeah with the little signs on the side of the road but I'm saying yeah of course
could always hold at me I'll school you any day the week for free hell yeah but that's what I would
do I would try to understand what's happening how I could get in there and then I would try to get
my credit right you know what I mean because if you're gonna buy because right now the interest
like three four percent which is very low you know I'm saying so and then the bank will lend you
money FHA because they want you to get in the game they want people to own houses so that's what I
would do FHA the FHA they're pushing those hard of course because they want home ownership right
and what's the what's the deal with FHA isn't isn't the uh well first of all I don't really
deal with that I don't deal with that I know I'm saying if you want to get in the game and you
ain't got no money right you got to figure out a way to get in the game it's like anything in life
you got to figure out if you go to a bar and you see a shorty a dime piece how am I gonna how
am I gonna hook up with this chick you gotta have some game right because if you ain't got
got games gonna bounce with somebody else right but isn't aren't the uh inspections for FHA's way
stricter they are but at the same time you have to understand real estate is going up by the month
the real estate's going up two three percent a month now so you gotta you gotta jump in the game
and then figure it out so where's it going what when's it gonna crash that's my question
well I don't think the real estate's gonna crash I'm gonna tell you why because we're in a hyper
inflation we're printing money by the trillions the United States government cannot afford to pay
to debt so the Federal Reserve is keeping the interest rates very low close to zero so that's
the reason why people want to own because the renters sky high and it's like it's like you
know people are like sheep they think oh my god my brother bought a crib he's dead broke
you know he bought it in 2018 now he got 100 g's in equity I'm over here sitting on a 1992
Chevy I said like I told you before my girl's doing three jobs I gotta sell my time max I'm
fucked people are like my language I'm done so you want to get in the game what other game
you're gonna get into right so that's where the money right man you're right the real estate is
the fastest way to get paid you know how to manipulate stocks or or a coin base and that
coin basis is like so volatile you know you're by the time you go home you're gonna drink a bottle
of Johnny black because you can't afford the blue you feel me yeah that's just what it is
hell yeah got me motivated bro real estate is the key to your problems believe me
you're just gonna get that down payment baby that that three percent that three percent down
finance owner look when I try to buy houses big money shit like a million two million I try to
leverage the buyer look I'm selling a property for 3.8 million dollars the guy signed a contract
to close in 18 months so what do I do I gotta play the game he wants to stick me for my paper
I gotta make him give me 30 40 50 g's a month to me on the deposit I'm making big money on the
product but I could afford to sell it because I don't need the money but when you deal with people
who have houses that are beat up another way I'm gonna tell you another way to get in the game
let's pretend you see you're driving down the street see a house the roof is shot that grass is high
try to call the owner yo what's up you want to sell me this crib all right cool I'll release option it
this way you could control the asset with little money on that paper little money out of hand the
name of the game of anything in life is to control the asset once you control it you're in charge
then you make money what the fuck's the least option is that where is that like rent to own
exactly so let's pretend I got a house and I don't want to deal with it I live in Canada or I live
in Jersey and I got this house and I don't want to deal with it right and I know I paid 150 000
in 2015 and I look at Zillow 260 let me get with this let me see what this guy's talking about
all right what do you want to give me 240 all right cool I'm thinking I need a roof I need a
kitchen I shit I gotta drop 100 stacks in this piece yeah why not take it and I'll do a deal
with you I think I'm getting over on you like yo give me a g a month deal with it and you fix it
you do whatever you gotta do so your job is to figure out how can I wholesale this so you call
the guy on the street yo peep this I got this crib what will you give me so if he'll give you 220
you tell the owner yo I could sign a lease option for like 200 I need help I got kids I'm hungry
sign a lease option I I lease it for 12 months at this price and I have an assignable assignable
it's very important this way you could flip the paper to him so you make 20 g's you didn't do shit
now you're rolling if you got 20 g's in your pot now you're a play poker chipping a chair
so you need when you in a booth when you on deck whatever you got as long as you got a little
shred of hope with game and knowledge you're good you ever see that in that movie that that tv
shows this guy's my mentor now it's not a mentor it's about reality you gotta focus on reality
you know it is a lot of people I talk to Danny you know it is it's like this oh I do this I do
this yo I don't hear I don't care about excuses daddy I get up at four in the morning I'm good
and I'm rich I'm paid the fuck I gotta get up at four why because I gotta eat because if I ain't
eating I'm I'm I'm dumping because there's nothing in life you know you ever see like when
somebody's dying their hearts and you see that flat line mm-hmm nothing in reality is flat line
except death it's either going up or going down you gotta try to figure out a way to play that
middle mm-hmm lease option ballgame I like that you know how I make a lot of money non-qualifying
assumable mortgage you know me school you on that yeah because I'm a school people on this
they're gonna flip out what's it called again non-qualifying assumable mortgages okay so let
me tell you how this works so I bought a property in Tampa Florida I'm not gonna give you the address
because I could if I want to but I'll let them holler at me so I bought a property in January 7th
2020 pre-covid it was 1.8 acres of dirt on Armenia Avenue right it was two folios
so I gave the lady 825 G's I gave her 170,000 down right so I had a non-qualifying assumable
mortgage with a three-year a five-year balloon at three percent interest on them I'll tell you what
that means so you know when you go get a loan they want to check your credentials they want to see
where you work they want to check your credit yeah they want to see if you could afford the mortgage
so how I do it let's say I'm buying off Danny right Danny I'm gonna buy this house off you for 300,000
here's a hundred thousand down so the hundred G's is ringing bells in their head because you're
already studying the seller the place is junk they ain't got nobody to fix it they owe back taxes
they're hit they're done you feel me and no person could get a retail loan on this dump
because they can't afford to fix it so the only other people that are gonna come in or cash crooks
they're gonna want to pay her two something right so how I come in is I look at the land if I could
split the dirt and do something else with that dirt and I got a non-qualifying paper I'm gonna
eat on both sides I'm gonna eat in the front and the back I'm gonna eat in the middle too and I'll
show you how I do that so anyway getting back to this I give you a hundred on 300 right so you
give me I create a mortgage and I give I try to get interest only interest only is always the best
for short-term flips because think about if you're barring 200 yeah but it's hard to get
interest only loans bro yeah but I'm not dealing with a bank I'm dealing with the seller this is
you you can get interest only I'm gonna school you for free I'm gonna tell you how to do I'm gonna
tell you who to talk to like I can actually go to the bank get interest only they're gonna tell you
why didn't you kick mention banks why would you ever mention a bank the person that's lending me
the money is the seller oh the sellers letting you the money of course the seller draw it up listen
to me the seller sellers broke he ain't got no money yeah but I'm already looking I went to that
I'm going I'm looking at there I'm looking to see if they got mortgages so I'm already working
with the seller you feel me so this guy got a piece of garbage that he wants 300 or 400 I'm
gonna try to get it where I could put a little money out of my pocket and they give me the mortgage
they become the note holder the seller becomes the note holder okay you understand me now I
understand I have many deals like this this deal I'm selling the sellers are no holder
so look you get the seller to hold the note okay and how you do a non-qualifying consumable mortgage
is like this so what hello hello sorry I'm I'm retarded I'm a school you on it I know but I'm
gonna ask fifth grade questions ask kindergarten questions all right kindergarten question this
is this is this may sound dumb but if it's a non-qualifying assumable loan so this guy owns
this house for 300 grand he owns it free and clear the seller has no debt what if the seller does
have a loan but then I have to give him enough down to pay his debt off I have to understand his
debt okay so okay so if he doesn't have a loan on the house you're paying him monthly and he's
holding the note exactly he's my mortgage holder okay so what non-qualifying assumable you want to
tell you why I do that so if I want to if I buy it from you and I want to sell it to him he doesn't
need to qualify for this mortgage because my seller is holding a note for me and I'm allowed to
throw that note on anybody I want you could be doing a bit in prison I could give it to you
you could be Mickey Mouse it don't matter I'm gonna let you're gonna take my mortgage over
you get it so I'm buying it for you for 300 and I'm giving you 100 G's down I'm out of pocket
like a hundred and five thousand dollars because I'm gonna pay net to seller right because most of
these people they don't want to pay closing costs okay so I'm gonna pay the doc stamps the
title insurance blah blah blah right the only thing they're gonna pay is the back taxes right
so I'm gonna buy the property so now I'm gonna push it on the block but I already know I'm gonna
sell it otherwise I ain't gonna buy it I already know I could redump it to somebody else right right
okay so I stepped to him I'm like look Joe just give me 375 give me a buck 75 down take over this
200 3 interest only amortized over 20 years if they want to do principal and interest you want a
heavy amortization because you want that payment to be low so you can rent it or do what you got to
do with a little bread out of your pocket you understand mm-hmm all right so then you repush it
you make your money and you walk that's better than paying cash because now you can leverage your
money multiple times do you understand what I'm saying kind of okay look you own the house no no
I get I mean I get the part where I get the part where you gave the guy 100 it's worth 300 you got
500 I'm giving them three because a piece of garbage that needs work right I already know I could
push it to him for 375 and he don't got he don't got all the bread because he don't want to go to a
hard money lender right because I told you before it's hard to make money with hard money right
because they're gonna hit you with two three points right they're gonna want 12% right and they're
gonna want to hear a balloon meanwhile you can't even get it done in a year so you need to have
control so I'm gonna get you to give me a loan where I could hold you can hold my paper and I
could flip it to this dude okay and how's this dude buying it cash no he's gonna give me the 175
375 my hundred I put down plus another 75 so I just made 75 on a hundred oh and I'm out now you
deal with it and now they're now they're just assuming they'll dump yeah he's taking my note now
he's getting where oh that's simple whatever that's simple bro exactly let me tell you another way
one second Aiden is he in frame right now
okay I'm gonna tell you another way I used to make money I used to buy junkers
for like let's just say I buy a piece of junk house you can't do this no more because the
market's changed right but I used to hold paper too so I buy this house for 50 g's right so I buy
for 50 I sold you for 75 I just made 50% right yeah wrong here's why I bought it for 50 I sold
to him for 75 he gives me 20 g's down right so he owes me 55 but I'm gonna charge him five points
so he's gonna give me another $2,750 for points so he's gonna owe me $57,500 at 12% but I only got
really 30 g's in this so he owes me 575 on 30 at 12% so point a month so now he's paying another
$575 you understand me so far yeah so then I go and sell this first note I sell this first note
to a mortgage buyer I'm like yo he owes me 575 at 12% give me 55 so I sell it to the mortgage I
sell to now I'm done and I just made do the numbers 55 plus 25 plus I made 20 some g's
basically on nothing because I sold him the crib and I dumped the mortgage that's some slick
but that's how you gotta do you gotta know how to push the paper then what you want then also you
got to do is you got to learn how to buy houses with double lots because right now my money's in
land I bought a property the other day for $245,000 three acres in Tampa I got it I tore the house
down I got a s1 variance to get 60 houses on it apartments now I'm dumping it for 900 I'm in it for
three yeah some loss though you can't they won't even let you split I tried buying a lot a couple
months ago and they were saying I was trying because it was huge I wanted to build two houses on I'm
like I could build two houses on this triple my money quadruple my money like I call the county
nope not a lot to split it you have to understand the future land use and you have to understand
so look like I don't really know much about this because I live in Tampa and everything I do is
mostly in Tampa so they have some land out there too very yes exactly not over here but look like
a safety harbor I'm looking at house guys got a motel eight doors with a little cottage he wants
1.2 I offer them a mill with 500 down and he's like no I'm not with this all right give me
but whatever my point is if I buy that I'll get back to what I'm talking about because I know I'm
I'm off track but look the way to make money is you have to understand how to split the land
once you buy the land you split it and then they have future land use so let's pretend the highest
density is CMU 35 let's just pretend the commercial use 35 per acre so that means every acre you can
put 35 doors right so there's a big necessity right now for affordable housing because there's
so many broke people the government needs to pay to build and they got all these tax credits
I'm so now since I write this property he's going to get tax credits to pay for it for free
and and the guy's like he's talking to my realtor why he don't do that I pay I'm making money I don't
care about all that I'm not looking I don't want my legacy tell my kids yo peep this daddy made money
because the government paid me what are you bugging what's wrong with that bro because I'm not with
that why because I like to get my money on the grind you feel me it's what motivates you of course
I'm not looking for a welfare check yeah you ever see that movie with um with fucking take it now
I'm not with that I'm not with that you know why because let's pretend you're on your death bed
and you got all your peeps with you right yeah and I remember we did this yeah you remember the
section eight paid me you remember I got a free check who's gonna look at you like you the boss
use a stump dummy remember we got that truck check but you feel me though the way the way I look at
it is like this how can I figure it out how could I how could I game the game yo what do you think
about Trump I love Donald Trump do you of course what's your favorite part about him he's this
ill with it tell you what time it is he's either it's like this bro look I'm a billionaire because
one dude called a millionaire a cnn like 20 years ago he sued him yo don't don't he sued him for
calling the fucking man that's who I am daddy I'm a I'm a billionaire that's next level how to back

I'm not I'm not no broke little dog that's going with a little whistle and all y'all gonna tell me
what to do I'm gonna do me yeah he's definitely he's definitely he does what he wants yeah I'm
pretty sure people hear me oh my god the sky this blah blah blah you think I give a shit what

what it is is you got all these liberal communists trying to eat oh let's see what retail we could

are you looking to sell or not really no not really all right but you would sell at the right number
everybody would sell do you own a lot of real estate or this is like one of your only things you

monthly in rent I mean I don't like to share all the details you know what I mean all right so
forest this will we'll make sure that this part is blocked off and no no one will no one will
be able to hear it I'll bleep out the I'll bleep out the sensitive so how many square feet is this
building 5000 and how big is the lot I think it's a I think it's a half acre all right so it's like
22,000 square feet so on a cash deal what would you look at for something like this what's that
let's pretend I wanted to buy it for cash what would you sell it for probably a million bucks
one million yeah all right so let me ask why do you sound so sad right now I'm just tired
so what is it that you did today that you're tired I was fixing the roof of my
he was up fixing the roof no no but my son owns a roofing company called roof dock he could maybe
help you next time but anyway real quick would you do any owner finance or just straight cash

so here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna talk to Danny I'm gonna get the address I'm gonna look it up
and maybe we could do a deal here all right I have to think about it but that would be my number
probably would you pay a million bucks for this place I don't even know the area I don't know nothing
about it I'm just gonna figure it out when I get out of here so let me ask you this so we'll follow
back on the next podcast so no no hold up so yeah I want a commission bro if you sell this
bitch for a million I want at least 10 grand that's only 1% anyway I'll discuss all this later
behind closed doors all right brother listen was a pleasure talking to you all right we'll talk to
all right be easy peace
what do you think he's a pussy he doesn't like to talk he's not a real hustle I don't really care
but anyway I just wanted to smoke cigarette man talk to me what else is good not much bro not much
I'm fucking I'm learning about bro I'm learning about real estate with you bro let me tell you
have you ever played I want to learn more about your childhood though I want to I want to understand
what's going on in that head of yours why how'd you turn out this way bro how am I you're
fucking wild man not really you're a wild boy I have a peep this when you go to school college
school job they train you how to serve the master you feel me yeah when you control your own destiny
you are the master and ain't nobody gonna serve you you understand there's no one like you anymore
everybody I rock what is like me you get it so I you look you have to understand you got to jump
into the people it's like this look I could teach you everything you know but I'll never teach you
everything I know you get it then at the same time if I deal with you you and your man I'm a I'm
a rock on the way you think but I'm never gonna put you on my level because if I put you on my
level but you probably can't freak with it and then we can't play get it everything is is a game
what do you mean I can't freak with it it's like this look what I mean by that let's pretend I'm
trying to do whatever I gotta do with you I'm gonna look at you like what can I get from this dude
that I would even want to deal with because if I can't if I can't conquer what I'm looking for
I have no use for you get it so if I put you in my field there's like a million things I do
so if you don't know how to if I can't give you the football and run with it you're gonna fumble
we're gonna lose right so my point is I gotta break you down and then pick you up and understand
what you got to offer if you got something off for me I'm gonna get it if you ain't got shit off
for me I'm gonna pass you off and I'm gonna look at your crew and I'm gonna look them all I'm gonna
try to suck everybody's soul what can you get what can I get from him what can I get from him
and how many are motherfuckers you got in your clique that I could school because if I can't
get nothing from you you ain't got no value to me but the good thing is I don't really think I need
nothing from you except exposure the only reason I'm coming here is because I got no social media
president nothing zero garbage and I'm seeing little stunt dummies getting paid so I'm feeling
yo yo what's up daddy how do we get paid how do we get paid by schooling these people how to get
bread so you think you could sell some courses or something to some people I don't want to sell a
course why not you can make some good money bro Grant Cardone you ever heard of him he's the
biggest thief in Florida Grant Cardone he pushes businesses he's he's a dream seller he the thing
is look you see this fucking jet bitch a million dollars a day nothing to me Scientology Danny peep
this if I gotta charge you to show you what I got then I ain't worth nothing I'm gonna show you for
free so you could make me though you get it it's like this let me give you an example if I know you
can make me money 10 times and you can make me 10 g's 10 times to start and he can make me 10 g's
and I'm because we're gonna do like a pyramid you're gonna bring people we're gonna eat off everybody
off my bread a pyramid's an mlm nah it's not it's like this look let me give you an example
everybody's a client every single person is a client when you deal with real estate everybody's
a client it's like this look yeah you know your mother your father your brother your sister your
cousin your your girl the girl your fucking her sister whatever you know everybody right
no this you know everybody yeah how can we get what they got to make us money whatever making
money everybody's happy right you get it you understand the game yeah or you don't feel me
you feel what I'm saying yeah I got all right look here's what I'm gonna make money off my girl's
cousin because if she has a house that her mother left her and she ain't got nothing in it and she
can't she can't afford the payments she can't afford the taxes she can't afford a rehab daddy
gonna come in and cop her set and I'm gonna pay you you feel me so everybody eats but if I gotta
charge you to school you so basically I'm selling you a class that ain't got no values so everybody
got no confidence in my ability because I gotta rip you off if I gotta rip you off
what value do I got so everybody you meet out in the world as a value your course the first thing
when you look into somebody's eyes you're trying to figure out how you can know the first thing I
look in your eyes is to see if you got hearts if you go freak with me see where you're at mentally
physically dominating me how can I dominate you mentally to fuck with me on my field
get it I get it but you're trying to figure out how you can make money with these how you
can leverage these people why wouldn't you because because what else am I gonna do play
tea set with them I don't get honest I don't care what you do what you do in your regular life has
no value to me how am I gonna eat what you do I could only eat if we could get loot if I can't
get bread I'm not with you when we were at the but when I met you at that bar the other day yeah
when that lady was talking crazy I mean imagine I already got a contract but that chick right there
the first thing you said to her she was a real estate lady you could tell and the first thing you
said to her is like listen what deals do you got that I could buy from you right now
and she was like what she said to be honest probably she was trying to make small talk with
you and then you were like listen I don't want to make small talk tell me what deals I could buy
from you right now give me the addresses getting right to the point yeah of course you know what
it is a lot of let me tell you let me tell you another thing I learned in my lifetime and I've
been doing deals since I was five years old you can ask anybody who knows me shoot silo play dice
play spades poker push whatever comic books baseball cards you name it the point is this
if you step to me and your game is wack and you ain't got nothing off of me the fuck I gotta
deal with you for you know I mean unless I could clean you up and show you how to get it I could
school people how to get it with nothing I like to deal with broke people by the way do you of
course because this is what I'm motivated right of course because if you got mad bread what you're
gonna do try to bang with me mentally right you're trying to out bang with anybody you feel me
what you're gonna tell me oh I do this I do that I don't give a fuck what you do what you eat don't
make me shit how are we getting it because most people who get it they're they're they're shook
because they're scared second they don't want to share the bread because they're greedy and they
don't know to get because like I told you from day one if you don't know what bad is you never know
what good is wait here's what I'm gonna say what does that mean or here's what that means
let's pretend like I told you from the rip let's pretend your father is worth a hundred million
dollars you went to private schools you got went to school limousines everything that you did was
force fed to you to get bread right your dad cuts you off gives you a million dollars throws you

I'm not doing you know that motherfucker drinks like 28 Diet Cokes a day John daily was the
Ellis he's an animal a gambling animal too he's a gambling fiend bro no sport no sport football
who's your favorite player my favorite football player of all time uh March on Lynch
B-Smo went to Buffalo he went then he went to Seattle he should have ran the ball they could
have beat Brady and Russell Wilson second-ranked power to be good okay give me next sport give me
another player any player you got any sport any player any sport any player baseball you know
your baseball I don't know shit about baseball yeah I like uh I like uh who's the fucking baseball
guy who used to fight everybody Nolan Ryan I like him bro he came up in 1968 his rookie car got
Jerry Koosman on it 1968 tops card number 177 he was clocked at 100.8 miles an hour he bro imagine
this he threw seven no hitters never won a side young 324 wins most strikeouts of all time the
illest so Lynn his name is Lynn Nolan Ryan who a whole mariela mu pittsburgh penguins oh come on
mariela mu had Hodgkin's disease he was making so much money that the pittsburgh pain was going
to give him the team he bought the team besides Gretzky he was the illest player of all time he had
Kevin Stevens and yarm Yager to win race who else yarm or Yager who else who else let's go
fuck I don't know I can't stump you now I'm Troy Palamalu oh come on I already talked about that
come on daddy he played for pittsburgh they won a night and they won in Tampa when they beat the
Arizona Cardinals bro safety the illest he was he just played the field who else
Kelly Slater who oh you talk about Saved by the Belt no pro surfing I don't freak with that you
don't freak with surfing not really because I I seen that one movie with a tick lost her hand
but I'm careful with the you know hold on surfing what about Jeff Spicoli fast times every
hell yeah what about Keanu Reeves oh of course bro the matrix but anyway the whole
point is be you got to be well versed you got to know a little bit about everything you got to
be able to hold the conversation about Steph Curry oh come on the illest three-point shooter of all
time bro the reason he didn't sign did you watch the game last night I remember in the first quarter
he hit some shot that was ill will but I'm not really I don't I don't really freak with basketball
my next fan and the Knicks back in the head like I followed the Knicks when they had Patrick Ewing
Charles Oakley mark bro the ill squad you come down the middle you're gonna get wrecked yeah so
like since basketball who's better LeBron or Jordan greatest of all time who's the goat LeBron
I gotta go but to me the best is not even none of those who's the best the best of all times
we'll chamber look his will to still oh yeah look him up he fucked more bitches than anybody
that's what I heard hundred point game whole point is out yeah we played for Syracuse at 100
points but the point is when you look and then you look at rings look at Bill Russell right
Bill Russell but Jordan got to be better he has to be better than LeBron because he played in a
better talent pool you know I'm saying when you look at the talent and he's probably debatable
he never had to play the gold state warriors though yeah be but you're up yeah with Katie no no I get
it I get it but they lost to Katie twice though LeBron lost to Katie twice so the Jordan was six
and oh and then he took a two-year hiatus day one three lost to and played baseball yeah the point
is I can't really I can't really say anybody's better than Jordan since 85 because he's undefeated
in championships and the whole world knows Jordan Jordan is a brand beyond the brand it's like
this you know Jay-Z was like I'm not a businessman I am the businessman so basically Jordan is the
game yeah Jordan is the hustle he's the game right but let's get back to real estate because
that's my game that's my hustle real estate what else are we going hard about I don't know I'm ready
to go buy something and sell it right now what about spoke up in this piece oh man I'm fucking ready

Pokemon I could understand there's money in that game this is not my hustle what about the sneaker
game yeah my boys my boy bro the illest sneaker man in the whole country let me tell you a little
story about my man JC Lopez JC Lopez what's the deal with him bro JC Lopez the illest motherfucker
ever lived I'm gonna tell you why this guy's from Jersey where I grew up he owns a sneaker store
called Urban Necessities you heard of it yeah you told me about all right so this kid grew up from
zero they dropped him off in Vegas my cousin Toby and he didn't even have money for food this guy
had a dream and he's like yo no matter what I'm gonna get here now he's the illest bro honestly
I'm gonna tell you why I love him he came here he came here like six seven years ago right so he
grew up with my cousins Candace who runs my company my cousin Paco her twin brother and her and my
cousin Ancho right and my cousin Toby right they all grew up Toby on the um he owned the
bail bonds JC worked with him and he grew up with my other cousins boom he comes here one day and

you know what I mean food don't matter to me I eat to I eat to live I don't live to eat get it
so he's at Brownie steakhouse boom I'm like whatever and he's like bro you remember one time you
told me that there ain't money in this shit I'm like now I don't remember you told me that's why
I'm a grind yo when he told me that I wanted to cry now when I go see him sitting our night the
illest sneakers of all time that's my story on sneakers and I got a couple friends of my here
they own sneaker stores I got involved with them it's a hard hustle it's not really my gig when I
figured out the work I had to do yeah it's just too much work it's a lot of work any game that has
a lot of work to do that you don't get big big zeros out of closing yeah yeah you're going big
yes it's like it's like this go big or go home tell me what do you want to get to like what's your
what's your ultimate goal in real estate like you want to be doing what you're doing now when do
you retire don't you want to fucking sit back and just be like telling this guy yeah I got I want
to sell this change by the minute so sometimes it's like bro you know I want to do this I want
to do I want to do the third but in reality what I realized was what is your ultimate fucking like
the the most in the perfect world like what is the perfect day look like for you like if you
could do whatever the fuck you want it and money didn't matter if I tell you this I know you're
gonna say you're nuts my ultimate goal is to bet everything on black in the bro that's able to
lose it all oh yeah grind back be dead bro do it again I got I got underwear's I got a bvd t-shirt
and I got a pair of chunk let us out why do a lot of people say that though because the grind is
a thrill daddy you want to have the grind because look what am I gonna tell you I want to buy I want
to buy the Taj Mahal and and and have golden condoms who gives a fuck about that that's you that's
like you casting your chips you sold the dream yeah you're out the box yeah you're not interested
in that hell no hell no that's whack a lot of people say a lot of people that chase chase the money
spend a lot of time like grinding and trying to climb the ladder over a long period of time
chasing money forever and when they eventually make it they feel like when they get to the top
when they get to the top of the mountain when they've achieved what they thought was their goal
when they earned when they earned their first couple million they finally be like okay wow
I finally got more money than I ever thought I would have and this is nowhere near what I thought
it would be it's not it's not what it was it was made out to be it's not I'm at the top I'm at the
top the quote top but it's so I'm gonna put it you like this repeat this so you remember Nas came
out with Illmatic in 93 mm-hmm he had five mics on the source in one of the song he's like yo I want
a hundred G's in a link that was his goal a hundred thousand dollars in a link bro look at him now
he thinks that just walking in a room the point is your goals change as the days change you you see
a goal it's like bro I want that but in reality monetary value has no value the only thing that
really has value is your memories fuck a monetary fuck money fuck bread fuck the dream it's about
what you can remember who you roll with what what can you talk about how I could school you to get it
you dead broke you want to get out can I make you eat how can I make you better like my barber
D barber ill motherfucker came out the block with nothing got mad kids ill is barber in town and
all he wants to do is help everybody why because when you are that dude and when you know what time
it is helping somebody get it and knowing that you got him there that has more value than money
because think about we're gonna eat steaks at bowls and mows over here go to um where where
am I going Monte Carlo like what time like straight up and down where you going yeah bro there's a lot
of uh there's a really good feeling in giving shit to people and making other you know what I mean
like giving shit away to somebody else it's not like that Bill Gates is throwing money in the trash
it's like this crying to get it let me school you how to get it let me show you how to get it
wake up like Pete did he ever get that show go get me some um go to nickabock avenue and get me
and get me a pastrami don't walk like why am I gonna walk why because we got to see if you're
dedicated remember the last time I told you when I came here I was a janitor in Brandon high school
walk four miles to work for six dollars an hour why because you got to get it you have to understand
how bad you need it how bad you want it what you're willing to do you have to grind mentally
with the next motherfucker that's nastier than you get it yeah because if this dude wants my money
I gotta bang with him physically or mentally and I'm not gonna lose too many mental battles
so now I gotta fight you getting a lot of fights not really no more come I'm an old school dude
I'm in the boxing gym three days a week but why need to fight for it I'm gonna catch a bit and
gonna sue me I'm not beef for that right this is not the old days when we could knuckle up and
shake hands later we're not with that no more we are in lawsuits now yeah everybody's fucking
suing now bro the game has changed the world has changed everybody like trying to get it
I'm telling you daddy the way to get this bread is to show people how to make money how can we
get a daisy chain because if you bring let me tell you how it is let's say you bring me 30 heads
right 30 heads of what 30 people you bring me 30 people feel me we talk about head what does that
mean Jesus like heads of cabbage heads of 30 heads dog 30 people and I school I put them in the room
look this is how we're gonna get it this is how we're gonna do it you're gonna highlight my man
and I'm gonna school him so he can school you then you're gonna call me on the deal
it's like it's like a a big you remember that movie um we're like at a basement what was it called
um damn and there's like a son of penny stocks wolf of wall street no before that before that
whatever boiler room boiler room yeah it's like this but instead of selling dreams we're selling
reality because I'm not trying to rob nobody I'm trying to stick them for their crib at the right
number no straight up you feel me does that make sense yeah it makes sense it sounds a little
straight up yeah because I'm telling you what time it is because look if you
it's as honest as it gets if you go into your crib and you see a 1970s couch where the
fuck is that chick from what's the name of that that I got that motherfucker for free no I get it
but I'm saying you you got you got um laminate wood on the doors how many bitches you think been
fucked on that couch I'd be like how many hundred in this in a matter of questions how many chicks
you smashed in a year oh then who cares that has no value so the point is like I told you the memory
but reality is you gotta school people in the hustle the game and you gotta put them so we
could get bread that's the name of the game but do it for free so you could eat everybody eats
everybody happy once you start charging for classes you're already trying to stick them
because if you pay me I got no faith in you so what's your goal what's your goal for getting in
the online game why do you want to create a following online why do you want to be on social
media because you know what it is I know a lot of people and I deal with a lot of people and I feel
guilty I'm not spitting my game to everybody I want everybody to know what time it is with me

can get it yeah it's like this first of all I'm not dealing with no realtor I own a real estate
company I call them you're hot at them yeah that's true bro look what could we talk about that
interest people because seems like listen to this dude was cool we're talking about whatever the
fuck interest about the people some more comments but you know what it is be I'm gonna be honest with
you I'm sweating bullets I want to smoke let's take a break let's take a break let's take a break
let's take a break it's not rolling I gotta piss anyway yeah all right fuck it I'm a hot a back
all right peace all right we'll talk about that later
Adam let's wrap it up how did how did you get back up how did you get back how did you uh get
tell me explain the bail bonds game what the fuck's to do with the bail bonds game how you make
money are you ashamed of it it's okay to be ashamed of nothing but hold on to one time real
quick I'm not the same of anything I've ever done in my whole life I did it because I wanted to do
it maybe sometimes I had to do it but one thing about you had to start you gotta start you gotta
get it twisted I ain't the same to sit I've eaten I've ate mayonnaise sandwiches though I've slept
in cars I ain't ashamed of nothing the reason I like the bail bonds because me and my cousin in
Jersey was doing bail bonds because think about it like this you selling freedom right so if you're
gonna get locked up most people who get locked up are shook because otherwise they don't need to be
out you know I mean you could go play spades knuckle up chill eat a salami sandwich cool out
eat a black coffee you're good but if you're shook you want to get out so your family your mom your
dad whatever they're gonna put up houses jewelry so the bail bonds like this you got a hundred
thousand dollar bill right so we're gonna post your bond hundred thousand you're gonna give me
10 grand plus collateral if you run I'm sticking you for your collateral so I lose no way and then
if you do run I got my bounty hunters who have more who have more power than the police they could
go into your house without a warrant and come get you so that's just a different hustle for a
different day that was in New Jersey back in the day yeah but that's out here too but the thing is
over there in Jersey you're dealing with like you're dealing with street cowboys you know what I mean
what's the street cowboy but dude that's fucked up and he knows he's wrong and he don't want to
face the music so he gonna get out because if he got priors he gonna do a long time so he gonna do
whatever he gotta do to be out okay so you already know your hustle you know what I mean yeah yeah
but like I said that's for the ages that's for another day the thing right now is the real estate
the real estate is the illest game of all time no matter what everybody needs somewhere to live
everybody wants to buy real estate because it's a commodity that that goes up sometimes look you
know when in the real estate crash oh wait oh my god I lost money you only lost if you sold
all them houses look at the numbers 99% of those houses in the city of Tampa are worth more now
than what they were worth in the height in 08 yeah I was thinking about that when I sold my last house
I sold it and I'm looking at this was like it was in it was five minutes from here in Largo
I sold it for 335 thousand square feet is it it was I sold it for 335 and it was
it was 2,000 square feet so now it's probably worth about 40 and I'm looking at it now and I'm like
the fucking zestimate on Zillow is like 398 for over 400 something like that I'm like I got fucked
I fucking left 60 that 60 70 80 thousand dollars on table but I'm thinking about it I bought my new house
it if it doesn't matter because this house I just bought would have been even more money anyways so
it's like you kind of stay on the same playing field it stays level because the shit you're
gonna buy next is still going up the same as the house you just bought you're the same as the house
you just sold the how the shit you're gonna buy is going up at the same fucking rate so no matter
what you're kind of staying at the same playing field well you have to remember there's a big thing
right now called inflation but the shit you sold is inflating the same rate as the shit you're
gonna buy I sold houses for 50 G's I'll buy them back today for 300 all day right in 2016 I think
I sold like 250 houses I admit that's a minimum number I will buy every single one of those houses
back at 100% profit to the person I sold to why because the supply and demand the cost of construction
the inflation the low interest the necessity the people moving here everything's moving except
the interest rate the reason the interest rate is down is because we're writing trillion dollar
checks and we need to keep the balance the interest rate low because we can't afford to pay the debt
can't you if you buy a house and you live in it for two years you don't pay capital gains right
nah but if you have homestead extension you and your wife you already got 500 G's or credit already
you don't have to pay taxes on it huh if you're homesteaded in that house you're allowed to make
a certain amount of money where you don't got to pay tax but once again don't take it 100% for me
because I'm not an accountant I hire people to do that my gig is buying and selling I I try to stay
focused on what I know I can't I don't wear 50 hats get it that's the best the best way to be I just
I I know how to make money on what I do you want to be a jack of all trades or master of none now I
try to master a few and then at the same time I try to dabble in a lot because the way I look at it
I listen the number one thing a lot of people do that they they don't listen so I got into Bitcoin
because some guy was telling me bro this is boom boom boom boom and I'm like all right there's 21
million bitcoins it's at this let me get in and then I seen last year during the COVID it
should drop to 4,000 was at 20 I'm like bro I got to buy some of these I already made money let me
jump back in then I seen this doggy coin at like 3 cent and I see Elon Musk and and Mark Chubin
trying to like make it happen meanwhile uh Elon Musk say I need money to get this SpaceX oh cool
you're gonna manipulate manipulate this let me jump in yesterday doggy was at 20 for saying outside
40 could have doubled up in one day so you gotta ride the wave whenever you deal with penny stock
doggy coin anything you gotta sit like like like a machine buy the dip sell buy the dip sell you
gotta constantly buy sell the thing about real estate you're not really shook because if you
could buy a piece of real estate and the rent covers the debt you're good right you feel me
and at the same time if you could take that dirt and make it bigger then you could flip it to an
investor who's gonna build as long as you control the asset the name of the game is control control
the property you make money lease option purchase owner finance whatever the name of the game is
control the mind of the person you see how that too how can I get in your head because you know
what I need people I need people because you ain't gonna control the asset unless you control that
person's mind who has the asset if you got cash you already bought in no matter what how you control
somebody's mind is like this how could you and let's say let's say I never met you Danny look
let's say I want to I want to make money with you right and I say look how on earth can we get
bread the only way that we can make money if you have assets that I can buy and sell because you
don't have any skills that I need besides that what other skills do you have that I could use none
none really I don't need laborers I don't need miracle workers I don't need like I don't need
none of that I don't need singers I don't need none of that I need somebody that could sell me
something I need to control an asset where I can make money how do you control assets by showing
you the ropes how you can make money and there's a lot of people who do what I say but they're
charging straight up and down if you got if somebody's right now is charging you to learn this
they don't really have confidence in their ability they're trying to stick you for your
bread and bounce you get it yeah what about people like Grant Cardone though he's making a
shitload of money charger people because or like tight you know the fuck Tai Lopez is
bro you know what Grant Cardone this guy sells businesses he's this he's that and you know I give
him credit for his hustle because he's making billions of dollars I'm not gonna shit on his
billions bro that's what he claims but the whole point what I'm saying is real I don't really care
because I don't listen to him but do you think is real you think he's really making billions the
thing is Danny it's like this how can I think if I'm not studying we could talk about sports because
I study yeah we could talk about real estate where I buy where I sell because that's all I care about
what this guy eats don't make me shit so I don't care bro have you ever heard of my bookie.ag the
website my bookie my bookie.ag it's a website where you can bet on all this crazy little like weird
little bets like you can bet on like if Steph Curry is going to score a triple double or 38
points plus so is there a vague in this like a 10% vague yeah so they're eating on both sides
yeah so Vegas wasn't built on winners my whole point is I don't gamble when I do real estate
there's no gamble okay no gamble and anybody who wants to holler at me say it's a gamble I'll prove
you wrong yeah but if you know more about what's gonna happen if you if you know more you know more
about sports than anybody I've ever talked to so if you know more about it this guy how this game
is gonna go but I know so look Roger Maris won the MVP in 1960-61 right who cares whatever happened
in the past is irrelevant what's gonna happen in the future I don't really know what's gonna
happen I don't know that the I you know I don't know that this horse is gonna win the Kentucky
Derby I don't know that because there's odds there this the book is stacked against you so why should
I gamble when I don't have to if I could buy real estate with owner finance and I know the zoning
and I could split the zoning I know the retail value minus the rehab I know there's money there
no risk in it yeah why should I dabble in something that's gonna make cost me money why should I
have to worry about something when I can worry about what I want to worry about if I'm eating
off what I'm doing why do I care about other things I deal with sports baseball cards because I
know the vintage cards are extremely rare and they're gonna keep jumping I know that already
because there's more demand and supply I know the Bitcoin and the and all these coins they're being
heavily manipulated because they want to create asset class besides a dollar and then on top of
that this is a transfer of wealth you got 12 year old kids making millions of dollars you got people
busting bank loads because they know how to control the game because they're making money without
putting money yeah they bought this coin so what put 100 g's buy and sell all day there is there
fun in that what's the sport how could I rob the guy that's holding the bag at the end but it's no
fun in that the fun is the chase the deal let me see how I can scoop this loot of what I did how
could I make this land bigger better stronger how could I make you money while making money what
about like buying a house like a three bedroom house and then splitting it and like adding a wall
making it a five bedroom house talked about that last time adding square footage because if you're
in a neighborhood with a square footage is 350 dollars it costs you 150 you just made 200 200
dollars a foot of course you always gotta maximize your potential maximize what you have study the
game before you dive in understand where you're diving at look bro there's so much money to be
made in real estate guaranteed look i'm a living proof bro i never went to school bro when my son
went to high school i even oh my god was so sad i told the teacher oh my god this poor kid is
fucked out he gotta go to school bro he got less time to get bread and i feel sorry for these dummies
that think you're gonna go to school you're gonna make money that's insane bro draw it up the teachers
don't make money why they in it these people are bro half these people on welfare food stamps on
employment there there's more money on unemployment than working why get in that makes no sense to me
yeah but look what else we talking about let's get that's it bro let's wrap it up man that was a
great way let's get there that's it we good how can people find your shit on instagram tell them to

more real right of course why do i need to like filter myself why do i need to school somebody
hey tell them brian buy scripts look me up and look me up online you can see my hud's
west tampa holdings florida area management florida notes uh dive pod look me up wait you
you were born in jersey or were you born in portorico oh no no my father was born in portorico
i was born in new jersey jersey city new jersey when's the last time you were in portorico
uh probably like eight years ago but i was but my whole life what what do you think about the
porto rican tax situation bro like like the you can live in portorico and you pay only like
two or three percent yeah because the thing is portorico is basically a commonwealth right the
problem is like portorico has been heavily manipulated by the united states of america
because portorico is not allowed to do trade with any other country except the united states right
portorico has like three million people there and they're and they're very dependent because they
had sugarcane coffee and so what if you only have to pay two percent tax what do you care no no i get
it but people go there manipulate the game right for sure no no obviously why are you
manipulating the game because like i told you i'm in my circle in my box like i said i like to have
fun not looking for handouts like i told you i don't i don't need to i don't i'm just want to pay
these commies yeah but it's not but you're right but at the same time it's good to pay because people
got to go to school somebody got to pay for the welfare somebody got to pay for the food stamps
somebody got to pay for the roads so you you agree with paying taxes for the roads for the welfare
for the no i don't believe in welfare none of that i believe in paying for necessity what do you
think taxes should go to if you were the president united states and what do you think all the tax
money that everyone pays should go to like what should it fund well we should never pay people out
of the country we shouldn't because the reason we shouldn't pay we shouldn't pay israel 700
million dollars for for weapons and rockets to bomb other countries no first of all i'm not a
political person because once again that makes me zero dollars yeah but i'm very ignorant when it
comes to politics because i could care less but just as a rational person if we have homeless
veterans that we have homeless people in the united states we should handle that
when it comes to the schooling situation i personally don't believe too much in higher
learning because i don't think that makes you money and if your goal is to make money i think
you should understand business before you understand school i don't even trade what about the ghettos
though well the ghettos are ghettos because that's the way it's hard to explain ghettos you know what
i mean because like like i'm talking about like chicago then fucking detroit like the worst neighborhoods
in the country where there's the most crime well there's a lot there's a lot of reasons behind that
because there's really no work there's no jobs there's no there's no education but the point is
you need to talk about reality and you need to have people help themselves and you have to have
inner groups of how do we get there instead of robbing and stealing let's just try shining and
making you get it let me help you i don't want to stick you for your bread i want to make you
breast and kibofi if if you understand how to make money you could you could show somebody else
but when it comes to like the government spending money i think we should if let's just say the
homeless for like an example right like that's killing california because they're getting
12 300 a month right so if i were to deal with the homeless i would take them out of the city
limits immediately i will put them in the county and i'll tell them let's just say i had 100 homeless
people how many people know how to do carpentry are you go here how many people know how to do
electric okay you go here how many people are in the nursing game so you put them in different
sections of what they're good at then you hire people that can educate these people and then if
they're drug addicts you got to get them off the drugs and then if they have mental problems you
got to school them but at the same time you can't let people live on the street because it's going
to destroy the economy then when it comes to the schooling there's a big problems with school
because there's a lot of people who go to school who depend on the food like it's a boring situation
but at the same time it's very important you know me i see you you're on he's taking a drink so i
can't really educate you because that's not my gig but in reality if everybody were to help each
other make it it would be a lot easier and if there was this is too much greed too there's a lot
of greed on the top a lot of greed with the with the yeah yeah yeah yeah but i mean i mean i mean
you're talking about like like obviously when you think of communists when you think of people like
that you think of socialism people giving off you make all this money you're like okay now i make
a hundred thousand dollars a year right i gotta pay a pretty good amount of tax right so i'm thinking
okay if i can make a million dollars a year how good off would how good would i be but no i gotta
pay now i gotta pay fucking four hundred thousand dollars in tax but it would be good if the money
went to working to make the public better like me personally i'll pay 90 of my money if i knew it
could help people and then it will come back to me because you have to remember if i made a hundred
million let's just say i made ten million bucks right and i got a thousand people with me and i
schooled them all how to get bread i'll make a hundred million because i must show them what i know
because if me if i know this where i come from the hood who i know ain't nobody ever helped me for
nothing my father died when i was 18 my mother worked in bakery she's still broke who helped me
my uncle was rich he used to ice workers hardware stores make a $50 a week my cousin told me some
make a $10 a week and what deal deal why we make so little you ever heard of college yes
this is your college he's a brian would you rather push a pencil or a broom i'm thinking
fuck i'd rather push a pencil how the fuck you're gonna push a pencil if you know how to push a
broom so here's my sorry i didn't mean to cut you off no no the reality is you got to educate
people how to get it and i like to educate people how to get it how did you educate your kid because
if you if you if you made it if you made it right if you have if you're making a lot of money
and you came from nothing your parents had no fucking money but then you have money and then
you have a kid and you want to teach your kid had to be like you are how do you do that because
you have because most rich people have their kids they go join the country because they don't want
to deal with them because they don't want to deal with their kid they rather pawn them off to
somebody else so they can make money and be out and and smash hoes they don't want to fuck with
their kids because they don't love their kids how do you treat a kid you show them what horrendous
is and then you school them in the game and you show them yo look dog i got 50 bucks when my son
bro listen when the real estate market crashed in 2008 i lost millions it was my son's um high
school graduation i said bro look we're gonna have to rent a shells it's like 800 you're gonna have to
put four i'm putting four but guess what you eat you eat the rest my daughter graduated year early
she did her hustle the point what i'm saying is you got to show them what you're doing and you
got to show them why you got to do what i'm doing yo my boy jay look i got bro i got i got mad people
in my camp my man jay when we didn't make money we would go eat dirt for that day if we didn't get
contracts we would eat dirt you know why because we don't deserve it you got to get your mind right
first of all you got to be spiritually right you got to be mentally right you got to be physically
right and you got to wake up you got to be on the phone before anybody in your team is up because
you got to school them it don't matter if you catch the check for a million dollars the day before
how the hell are you going to take a vacation and one of your man in your camp is broke are you crazy
you're only as strong as your weakest link like i told you the last time think about it logically
if you got 50 people in your camp and you're the worst how ill is your team get it like i told you
i have zero employees i only have partners because if you my partner you got my back i got your back
but if i'm paying you you gonna stick me because you you see oh god this guy just made 100 stacks
