I didn't want to leave everything behind and the way we worked it out is this.
I was 76 years old when we left by the way and it was on March 25th 2012.
On my 75th birthday my wife Becky got my daughters Denise and Laurie to send me 75 gifts.
Some of the gifts were like a pen or it was some little trinket and the other was bigger
but I had these boxes of gifts so the security saw this so they saw that I got 75 gifts so
then we started sending out particles that we had to her mother who was going to have
a birthday and they allowed it to go because they thought well I got 75 gifts I'm probably
going to give her about 70 some gifts you follow me Mark so that's how we were able
to get a lot of our belongings off that otherwise I couldn't put everything in a car.
So then it's coming down to the day that we're going to leave and I get up at 7 o'clock
that morning we have breakfast at 9 o'clock it's Sunday and prior to that what I had done
on every Sunday morning from months is I would get in my car and I would drive across from
the southern part of the base through the gate to the northern part come back and go
into the studio which in the studio there was a refrigerator and I always had maybe
Italian salami some provolone cheese some brie all kinds of fancy little things that
I would store there and I'd come through the main gate and I'd give these treats to the
security guards every Sunday morning so basically what I was doing was feeding the watchdogs
and getting them used to the fact that I'd be going to the north side of the property
every Sunday morning to get a treat before breakfast.
So now we're coming to the day that we're going to get out of there and by the way the
night before I have a bag full of shoes in a mesh bag and I'm putting it in my car and
one of the security guards drove by looked at me doing this didn't even mention it and
I'll tell you why my cover was this I was 76 years old nobody thought I would ever leave
and I was the father of the chairman of the board and those two things were the best cover
I had for our plan being executed and going into effect.
Now comes the day we're leaving we go out to the car I had a little notebook which I
still have and I marked in there all the things were taken and things were leaving and there
are two gates on the lower side of the property the main gate where the security guards are
is as like a booth in it where the security is and they have infrared things where they
can look all over the base and just all kinds of electronics equipment to see if anybody
is trying to get out or get in and there's another gate called the west gate which is
west of that about 150 yards down the road and all it is is a gate that there's a camera on
that they can you buzz you press a button they look at you through that camera and if you hear
the gate go Bob it's opening and they'll just open the gate for you or if they want to question
you they'll say well come up to the main booth so now we're in the car and there's I know this
because I've planned this out on Sunday morning there are only two security guards on duty
Jurgen is in the main booth and Sal is in the chase car when I say a chase car it's actually
like a van that this guy has and he uses it to chase people if they try to escape
but Sal is down at the place where we have breakfast which is about 50 yards away from the
main booth I know this because the chase car is parked outside that building so I thought okay
this is gonna work meanwhile my heart is in my throat I get up to the gate I press the button
he didn't even ask me a question he just opened up the gate I slowly pulled out
said to Becky we're turning left Becky I turned left pedaled in a metal got it up to about 75
miles an hour because of what one mile down the road there are three decisions you have to make
if you turn right you can go to route 10 which will take you to LA if you go straight it'll
take you to route 60 which takes you to LA if you turn left you go into the town of Hemet
I knew that when Sal came there he would figure I'm probably gonna go turn right to get on 10
to get on the main highway that's probably what he did I don't know what he did but once I turned
left it's a straight mile shot before you get into Hemet once I got into Hemet I turned right
and we were free that trip across the United States took me almost three days I paid for gas
paid for food we stayed in a motel two nights everything was paid with cash because if I used
my credit card they would check they would got me they would have a way to know where I was
they would fly people out to where I probably would be and they would have seized me and taken
me back and Becky how much cash had you saved making 50 bucks a week well I was at a point where
I was getting an amount of social security so I was getting that also because of my age but a very
small amount because I spent 26 and a half years on staff and they pay in almost on 50 bucks what
do they pay in social security now how do they did they you get a w2 for that was that like
yeah accounted for yeah you can see for the year $2,500 wow man you can't do I mean you
you can't do shit with $2,500 a year I don't understand like I would uh I figure most people would
just quit so much earlier after making that kind of money like okay this is great Scientology is
wonderful it teaches you all these great things but you're making $2,500 a year how does that how
could that justify making such such a small amount of money because your mind is conditioned into
thinking what you're doing is helping every man woman and child on the planet yeah you Danny you
don't know that state of mind unless you're in it there was a group at one point way back maybe in
the 60s called the Peace Corps you ever hear that yeah okay they these guys got pittances
but they did it because they figured they're helping all of men and with Scientology and they
probably were to some degree but with Scientology they talk about clearing the planet they haven't
cleared a fucking cul-de-sac yet you know what I'm saying yeah but your your mind is set you
you get people on who've been in it for years they'll all tell you a similar story
so what was your plan what was your plan you got you got on the highway and you you drove across
the country you and your wife what was your guys plan and what happened what did those guys do
once they realized that you were missing well I'm sure the shit hit the fan because um for me to
leave that was a terrible thing that because I would be considered a really sensitive particle
or a security risk what was my plan I wanted to live my life in freedom that's what I wanted to do
I wanted to get in communication with my two daughters and my grandchildren
and see them and maybe go back to playing my horn again or there's exercise devices I was
selling I could do that and just just enjoy life that's all it was and did you anticipate them
hunting you down after this oh yeah I know they'd come after me but I didn't know when
but it wasn't for maybe about almost two weeks that I'm sitting in my wife's mother's place and
by the way you know this is my second marriage I'm married to a much younger woman and we're
sitting in her mother's place and her mother has like a split level home and I look out the back
window in the kitchen and there's this person Marion Pau walking around trying to look through
the windows so I go outside and there's Greg Will here and Marion Pau who had come out to
salvage me to bring me back and they're trying to be jolly and funny and then saying oh Ron
it's so funny because we thought you're gonna go to Florida we never you thought you'd come here
but here we are ha ha ha you know and I said Greg listen I'm not going back I mean that was a
terrible fucking life I lived so you can just cool it and then he pulls out this bulletin and he
said you blew now blow is in other words for leave without authorization okay and in that technical
bulletin listen to this Danny it says the only reason that a person blows is because they have
committed harmful acts to the group that are they're a part of so they want to remove themselves
from the group so they don't continue harming it it doesn't say anything about you could be living
such a miserable fucking life that you take anything except staying in that group and that's why you
left doesn't say anything about that it says that it's your fault that you left because you've been
hurting the group and now you want to get away from it not to hurt the group anymore does that
make sense to you oh yeah I mean how convenient for them exactly you're you're a danger that's the
only reason you could have left there's no there's no reasonable explanation for you to leave that
you got it entirely I don't have to tell you no word another word about that but I will tell you
they hung around and they started calling me every day and they never answered the call
and so after about a month we went to visit my son Ronnie down in Virginia
and when I came back I went to the motel that were they were staying at and the car was gone so
I had they had left they didn't want to go back because they had to go back until David listen
we didn't get them and at that point you're in you're in deep trouble a very deep trouble
so now
year goes by this is 2013 now I purchased a house in West Alice where I'm talking to you
from right now and across the street one night there's a guy over there looking in the windows
of a house that's for sale the next door neighbor calls the cops and says listen there's some guy
looking in the windows of this house that's up for sale I think you might be a drug dealer
out comes the West Alice police primarily a guy by the name of nick pie who at that point he was a
detective and he confronted the guy and said what are you doing the guy says what am I breaking
the law what am I doing wrong he says well I'm just asking you what you're doing you're looking at
this house and the guy says oh you know you started giving him a bunch of crap now I don't
know where he had the guts to do that because nick pie is built like an NFL linebacker it looks
like he can bench press 400 pounds and he actually can okay so nick pie says listen I'll tell you
what you're under arrest can I look in your car the guy says sure nick goes and looks in the trunk
of this van which has blacked out windows and in the trunk of that van is five license plates from
five different states five handguns a stun gun two rifles one fitted up with a silencer
and two thousand rounds of ammunition what the fuck yeah this and by the way just for your viewers
and anybody else on my website therealronmiscavage.com you can go there and hear the interrogation
that nick pie and ricky hankens who was a tobacco alcohol and firearms agent you can hear the actual
interrogation of dwayne powell and his son daniel powell they were a father and son team
and here the thing i'm starting to tell you right now they can hear this actual interrogation
now it turned out that they were getting paid ten thousand dollars a week to follow me
and they had they had to follow me from eight in the morning to eight o'clock at night
and then if i went out after that they still have to work
under upon the interrogation once dwayne powell knew that he was in deep kaka he started singing
like a canary and he said listen we had no meant the man no harm and uh we used these for target
shooting and uh he was indicted though by the way by the by uh an eastern constant court and
the church probably the church because i don't think he'd have the money to do it
sent up an attorney from chicago that got him on five years probation but anyway as part of that
interrogation they mentioned a scene that happened in a local supermarket that i was
shopping for groceries and this was the summertime and i had a pocket t-shirt on and i came out to
the car had groceries in the cart opened the back door and was going to put the groceries in
and i bent over to do that and i thought my cell phone was going to fall out of my pocket
so i grabbed my left chest with my right hand these pis are in the van of course i didn't
know that at the time they saw me and the father says to the son looks like he's having a heart
attack i should call in and see what we should do so dwayne called in and a guy came on the phone
by the name of greg and greg said listen i'll get somebody on the phone for you within minutes
another person got on the phone identified himself as david miscavige and said listen
if it's his time to die let him die don't intervene don't do anything
