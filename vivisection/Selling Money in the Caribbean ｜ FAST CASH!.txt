What are you so late?
In case there's a problem, it has a little bit of strength to pull it, so that thing will
inflate.
Okay.
And then also that we have a life raft.
I mean, we're not going to need these things though.
No, no.
Just want to remind you.
Let you know that they're here in case, you know, there's a situation.
The life raft, the way it works, it has, you know, it has a little handle, you just have
to rip that up and it pops out.
Yeah.
Perfect.
Great.
That's comforting.
Let's just be ready to wait in the free part.
So, I'm in charge of operations for a chain of pawn shops, which originally started in
the Caribbean, is now branched out into the U.S., so we've got stores ranging from Orlando
Florida up as far south as Barbados, which is basically Central America.
Our stores are located, we've got five in Jamaica, two in the Bahamas, three in Turks
and Caicos, Barbados, St. Kitts, Antigua, Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent, so I basically
spend my time traveling the stores, generally try to carve myself out some free time when
I'm in the islands to explore, see what the local cultures have to offer.
These little things, that one little thing right there is worth probably $10,000 to $12,000.
That's a nice one, but we've had a lot nicer ones.
We sold one for $115,000 last year, one little pearl.
So I sold it to a middleman, that's not even what the end user paid.
That thing ended up probably as the centerpiece of a nice necklace that was worth a million
bucks.
So when a customer comes in here, they either have stuff that they don't want to get rid
of anymore, they just come in here, we negotiate a price, they dump it, we try to make good
deals so that we can resell it and make some money.
Alternatively, they've got an item that they really don't want to get rid of, but they
need some money, they need to get by to their next paycheck or something that's coming
in.
So we'll offer them an option to like a pawn in the United States where we give somebody
a certain amount of money, we keep it safe back here and they have up to 30 days to come
in and make a payment or pick it up.
So the balance is the value of all those things combined that you have?
Yeah, it's the amount that we've given out, so not necessarily the value, $239,000, that's
pretty good.
That's number three in the company.
We're trying to try to get in more.
Yeah, always try to get in more, we hit that $300,000 number.
If you see our service charges, it's a little tight, so I feel like more points we get,
more money at the bottom line.
What's the biggest item that you guys have done alone on currently?
Well earlier this year, now we just deal with the cars, we do like $3,500 on a car.
Yeah, I was actually a good car.
The average buyback option here is probably less than $200.
So our average deals are small, small deals.
We've done big deals here, we've done a few $100,000 deals here.
What?
Real estate, boats, cars.
People can pawn real estate.
Yeah, they have here at Freeport a couple times.
Yeah, as long as they have people working.
I mean all kinds of stuff.
I mean the one that did the most.
We brought in Salvador dolly paintings, bricks of platinum and gold.
What's like the weirdest thing you've seen?
The weirdest thing?
It would have to be this girl, she was trying to sell us a toy collection.
Did you buy it?
Really?
A used toy collection, huh?
I actually have like a briefcase, once it pops up, everything just opens up and like
She came up with a briefcase, I was like, all right, what do you have today, what do
you want to do?
She's like, I have some stuff, but I don't know if I can pop it open, yeah.
She's more worried about me than her, because she's ready to just pop it open.
Want to show something?
I'm going to go check out this car.
Ready?
Yeah, let's go check it out.
This is what we're whipping.
See if we can get it running.
It's a Mercury Grand Marquis, but I don't even know what year it is.
1974 would be my guess.
How much do you think it's worth?
I have no idea.
I can't imagine.
So I'm really hoping we get to drive this.
If not, I got to go rent a car.
But this car is way better for off-roading than the Riffles, so.
That's it.
The pump is not working or...
The pump stopped.
Try it.
That sucks.
That's me, man.
That's what I'm saying.
If that's what it was for, I'm doing it to be as soon as you, man.
Come on, man.
Give me something on that.
Where can I get a conch salad around here, man?
Oh.
Conch salad.
Conch salad is down the way.
You got to go.
Conch salad is down the way, man.
You got to go.
Come on.
Come on.
Get a conch salad here.
Right up.
Get a conch salad.
I hope you get a big salad right now.
I hope you get a big ten carat one right now.
I can find one carat again.
You got one in your pocket?
Yeah.
For real?
I haven't talked to you.
When I came here to get conch salad, I didn't know I was going to be digging in your pockets.
You just pulled out of a conch?
Yeah.
That's only one dollar one.
Yeah, that has like zero gloss.
And it's light.
So what do you do to it right there?
Just clean it.
Oh, you clean it with a lime?
Yeah.
You can't get a lot of slime off it.
All those guts coming out of it.
All those guts?
Yeah.
It'll be right, you know.
You got one time?
Huh?
How did you get your conch?
I don't know where else.
You go get it or fish it and we can drop it off?
My cousin now.
You know that's great.
That's what we're getting to it now because they can take it off.
You say you like it spicy?
I like spicy, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I'll pepper it right now.
Conch leaves.
That's a ghost pepper.
Yeah.
Yeah, man.
Ready?
All right.
How long have you been doing this here?
I do construction work.
Listen to me about you.
All my problems done this from day one, you know.
I didn't see you one more time but I'll get you.
That tastes good.
All right, Donny.
All right, guys.
All right, Donny.
All right.
One minute.
Day two in search of the hole.
What's up?
What's up, man?
Is this where the blue hole is?
Yeah, that way.
But how do you find it?
I go and walk around the city.
I'm here driving right to the end.
You want me to show you where it's at?
No.
Huh?
No.
You want me to show you where it's at?
Okay.
I was guessing.
Follow me if you want to see.
Okay.
All right.
You've never been here before?
No.
Follow me.
So today you're just looking for the hole?
Yeah.
I've been racing.
Really?
Going back this way.
I didn't find it at all.
Is this it?
That's a hole.
I've never seen one.
I don't know how deep it is.
There's just like a silt over it because the tide hasn't moved.
This water goes out to the ocean.
It's clean.
I'm guessing it's deep enough.
I'm not jumping.
You guys need a plan.
I'm not jumping.
You guys need a pilot to take you to the hospital.
That's true.
There's like six, I think six miles of underwater mapped cave systems here.
The crazy divers have gone and just exploratory right into the fish black and mapped the caves.
And that's not all the caves are there.
That's just what's mapped.
Time to get to the airport, jump on the plane and get home.
Back to the real world.
On to the next island.
