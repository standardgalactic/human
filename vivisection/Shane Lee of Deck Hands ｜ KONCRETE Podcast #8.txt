You want headphones?
You want headphones or no?
I figured you might not want them.
Well, I don't know.

I'm just using to make sure the audio...
Yeah, we just use to make sure the audio's good.
You're good.

All this fucking stereo equipment, right in front of my ass.
Let me take you to this goddamn little fucking show right here, fuckers.
Okay, now...
They come to my boat.

But yeah, we got all of this created into one motherfucking stereo system.
Come on, man.

And...
Fuck it.
Fuck yeah.

Tell us a little bit more about you.
Well, I'm Shane Motherfuckinglee and I live at Junction 666.
Yep.
I'm just looking at the video right now.
This is so amazing, fuck.
Yeah, this is Shane's documentary called Deckhands.
This is the...

That was the one that got me in there.
This is where it all started for us.
Shit, yeah.

It's Lady Bly and Coke.
Well, fuck yeah, we got it.
So is this like Captain Morgan or...
Cheers, brother.
Is it better?
Cheers.

Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah.
So, fishing sucks anymore.
I mean, totally fishing.
So, I've been doing red tide cleanup.
Well, tell me, first give me a big background.
How long have you been fishing?
How long have you been commercial fishing?
43 years, fuckers.
All of these in Florida, Madeer Beach or what?
No, I'm one of the four different states for killing fish.
Okay.
Fuck yeah.
No bullshit.
Fuck yeah.
Sharks, fuck it.
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.
I've killed them all.
So, in the documentary, we kind of covered what you do in Madeer Beach and what your role
is on these commercial fishing boats.
Give me like a quick background of what you've been doing commercial fishing in Madeer Beach
for the past couple of years.
Just give me like a quick summary.
For the couple of years?
Yeah, what have you been doing?
In Madeer Beach?
Well, we had a little problems there.
I worked on one boat and they, well, I got, my arms got infected because of some pesticides
on a boat and, yeah, so I had to take off about six months out of that.
When did you start fishing in Madeer Beach?
1978.
78.
Yeah.
Always in Madeer Beach.
No.
Like I said, I'm one of four different states for killing fish.
Come on, fucker.
Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah.
Where are you from, Shane?
Where are you born?
Aurora, Illinois.
Illinois.
Aurora, Illinois.
That's where they made the movie, Wayne's World.
Hell yeah.
Yeah.
Fucking party on, Shane.
Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah, Garth.
Fuck yeah.
No.
And what brought you to form?
Names have been changed to protect the fucking innocents.
What the fuck?
Fuck yeah.
What the hell brought you to Florida?
Ooh, he's a little runaway.
So you ran away to Florida to get a better life.
Fuck yeah.
I ran as far south as I possibly could from Aurora.
Were you already fishing before you came to Florida or you started when you came down
here?
Better fisherman since I've been born.
My fucking mom and dad, everybody fucking, we go fishing.
Yeah.
And I hated to taste the fish.
So me and grandma would always eat motherfucking hot dogs.
Fucking stuff that would cook the fish with them fuckers.
But grouper is different.
Yeah.
You ain't catching a grouper up in Chicago?
No.
No.
Fuck no.
What are you catching up there?
Crabs.
Yeah, fuck yeah.
Man, we need to get space up here with this.
Well, space.
He's just fucking.
What happened now?
Who's this guy?
Who's this guy?
That's fucking my brother.
Ready?
Fuck yeah.
He's not really a.
That's what he said.
That's what he says.
Yeah.
Then small growled out in front of my room.
Fuck yeah.
So what are you doing nowadays, Shane?
Well, I've had enough of this fish and shit and everything has gone crazy with this red
tide cleanup.
Right.
So we got red tide.
So that's what I do.
Can't go fishing.
I want to help everybody here in Madera Beach because this is where I'm from.
And so I thought, well, I'll just help clean up the red tide because nobody else will.
Yeah.
And I could stand a stink barely.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
I fucking puked my lunch.
So how bad is it on a daily basis?
You got there and you just clean fish up all day.
Dead fish.
Yeah.
It's getting more better.
I mean up and down the beaches.
That's what we patrolled last week.
Yeah.
But then I'm a fucking now we're on the boat.
Boat for grade.
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.
That's what you guys got on the boat to what different islands and clean up and clean
up right out of the water or what?
Go right up in the waters and everybody's backyard fucking helping everybody out because
I hate red tide.
Yeah.
Because I love Madera Beach.
I love everybody around here and nobody else will do this shit, but motherfucking shame
motherfucking Lee will fuckers out there in the storm.
Yeah.
When's the last time you went fishing?
When the boat sunk.
What boat sunk?
Well, I don't remember what the name of it was, but yeah, we fucking we got.
That was amazing adventure dudes.
Fuck.
Yeah.
Tell us about it.
Well, fucking all of a sudden we wake up in the morning and we had these two fucking
kids working with us.
They were cool as fuck though.
They worked so hard and shit like that.
And then one little kid, he was pretty special.
He was started.
Yeah.
But he was fun.
But it fucking.
Yeah.
So all of a sudden fucking little Kyle dude, man.
When the boat started to sink and we had coast guard helicopters, airplanes.
We fucking had so the acts fucking.
Oh, it's so fucking fun.
So why did the boat sing?
What happened?
How does the boat just start sinking?
Fucking the goddamn.
It started taking on a little bit of water and then the battery bank casing broke.
Right.
So it snapped the fucking high water alarm about time that we figured out we were sinking.
What are you thinking about?
Well, hello.
This is the Russian coast guard.
What are you thinking about?
No, I'm an American.
We are sinking.
What are you thinking about?
No.
I'm an American.
The boat is fucking sinking, motherfucker.
So how far?
No, this is not the Russian coast guard.
Where?
How far out are you when the boat's sinking?
145 miles west of Guy West.
What happens when you're 145 miles offshore and the boats are sinking?
They just started making them blow their whistles.
So it's you and how many people?
Three others.
Three other people.
Yeah, that was fun.
That was one of the most experienced out there, right?
You got a bunch of greens with you.
Captain, fucking Shane.
Fuck yeah.
Or that could be Captain fucking the dirty videos.
Fuck yeah.
Oh my god, these fuckers are crazy.
Why are you so fucking crazy, Shane?
Well, I want to thank my mother, my father, my grandpa, Uncle Rocky, everybody.
And you know who I am related to inside of that fucking hole?
Who?
Fucking tree things, you know.
Family tree?
Yeah, what are they fucking?
The tree things.
Who are you?
Jesse James, the notorious motherfucking gangster.
You're 23 and me results?
Jesse James?
Jesse James.
The original Jesse James?
Fuck yeah.
Fucking get off the train, motherfucker.
Bandit.
My dad was general master.
So it makes perfect sense that you're a pirate.
Fuck yeah.
What happened there, dad?
Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah.
And anybody that gets pissed off about this whole situation, you can kiss my fucking ass.
Remember about the size of the deck?
Nine and a half.
By what?
By five and three quarters inches around.
Tell him.
What's that?
That's the size of my cock you get to suck if you hate my videos, fucker.
What do people think about the videos?
I don't give a fuck.
What do they say to you, though?
They like it?
I mean, I'm just me.
Yeah, always.
Come on, man.
If you're not you, who are you?
That's what fucking pissed me off is that this fucking, so I finally get this job working
on the beach, right?
Fuckers?
Doing what?
Cleaning up red deck.
Okay.
Okay.
And then fucking, then I go to the goddamn thing to cash my check.
And I haven't had a check because I always been paid cash.
Fuck it.
Oh, that shit.
So you probably don't have a bank account?
No.
Oh, fuck, though.
No.
No.
It's in my pocket right now.
Fuck it.
Same as always.
Yeah.
Fuck it.
Yeah.
We don't need the bank to hold our money.
The pocket works.
This is good.
Fuck yeah.
How'd you get all that money?
Because you got to work for a Vlevin, motherfucker.
So you're cleaning up the dead fish.
Fuck.
Work.
You made all that money cleaning up the beach, cleaning up the dead fish?
No.
Well, I just, you got to work.
Yeah, for sure.
That's one thing about Shane Lee that everyone always says is, I mean, as wild as you might be,
as crazy as you might be, you always are the hardest worker out there.
That's what they say.
Fuck it.
Tell it like it is.
Fuck it, Shane.
Right.
This dude's name is Shane to it.
Right.
And that's why I knew we'd always get along because we're both named Shane.
Fuck yeah, man.
It's a guarantee.
Fuck her.
Fuck yeah.
But that's what they always say.
Shane might be wild and crazy, but he's the hardest worker out there for sure.
That's what I was training for my whole life when I was a kid.
That's why I moved to fucking Florida so I wouldn't have to shovel fucking snow anymore.
Bullshit.
I've worked a fucking shovel here more than I did fucking shit.
You're fucking fried, Shane.
How'd you get so sunburned?
Well, because I got burnt fucking.
Remember I told you that dude sprayed my bunk with rage and fucking burnt me?
Yeah.
Hey, well, yeah, let's get into that story.
So that was recent, right?
Yeah, so I had to take three months off.
So you're out fishing and what happened?
You wake up one day and you're all fucking itchy or what?
You know, I come back home and fucking, I was like goddamn arms had pesticides on it.
Fuck it.
Did you know that though?
You didn't know that.
No, I fucking thought it got, yeah, it's a long story.
Tell me.
Yeah, let's get it.
We need to talk about it.
Nah, I probably shouldn't do this because I'd hate to fucking tear him down.
No, that guy almost killed you.
Fuck that.
Yeah, he almost killed me.
Fuck him.
You got damn right, he almost killed me.
Right.
Yeah, and he confessed to it at the end, but we're going to drop that because...
No, I don't think we should.
Just tell us the story without telling us his name.
All right, yeah, we'll leave him anonymous for the sake of it.
He knows who the fuck he is.
He knows.
And this is all we got to say about this because...
So, I saw the pictures.
Everybody knows.
Your arms, I mean it looked like your arms went into a fire.
It looked like your arms got burnt and swolled up like Popeye size.
Yeah, they cracked in there.
But they're red like they got burnt.
Yeah, that was the pictures that you saw was fucking two months later after the fucking
my skin popped.
So for three...
So we're not going to talk anymore about this.
We need to get into it.
We don't.
Come on.
We don't have to talk about it right now.
No.
They know who they are.
They know what they did.
If they really want to blow this shit out and fucking...
Well, we'll just look at the old paperwork from the hospital again.
I don't give a shit.
You've been in the hospital a lot in the last couple of months, right?
No, no.
I think good.
Oh, okay.
Yep.
All right.
Other than what happened to my arms and shit like that, then a year before that was pancreatitis
because I drank too much vodka.
That's why I switched to fucking rum fuckers.
Yeah, but the rum treats you nice.
Never been six sets.
Six sets.
Six sets.
Six sets.
Fuck.
We're drinking Lady Bly and Coca-Cola.
Yeah.
I mean, this is going to be a different podcast for us for sure.
We're pretty liquored up and we have the Shane motherfucker here with us tonight.
But, yep.
We're going to design a brand new Facebook for our fucking fans out there.
Can we pass me that?
Oh, fuck yeah.
That was a nice crease.
I've almost got it.
Oh my god.
Do you see his fingers work on that?
Fuck.
So what else has been going on?
What's been going on with Space?
He's got his new retard bike.
Yeah.
You see his bike?
No, we haven't seen him.
We haven't seen him in months.
Tell me about him.
He shaved his whole hair or something.
I saw a picture he shaved his head.
Okay, now listen.
Fuck it.
He's got this little fucking sit-down bike with a fucking cap this year in it.
And it pedals.
He's got these little two little steering wheel-y thingies.
Fuck it.
This sucks.
I'd put a chain steering wheel on it.
Fuck yeah.
What about what happened to...
So let's pull up this video.
This is the episode we shot with you.
The laser light show on the XXX.
The timeout, the XXX.
What happened to the XXX?
Where is it?
Well, it cost me 6,500 hours because they pulled the motors and then the fucking, the hoses were left tied.
They didn't tie them up.
What happened to the boat though?
It sunk.
It's gone.
How did it sink?
They fucking did not tie up the hoses.
The hoses...
To the pumps.
No, to the engines.
Because they got a fucking outtake engine.
Fucking for the thing, whatever.
But they fucking, they did not tie up the hose.
So the fucking...
But you lived on that boat, right?
How long did you live on that boat?
Oh, I don't know.
But I know I fucked over 35...
100,000 girls on that boat.
Fuck yeah.
The lot lizards?
No, I've been fucked 35,000 times on there since I owned it.
Fuck yeah, that's what I'm saying.
I missed that.
There might only been 20, 30 girls, but...
Yeah, I fucked 13, 14,000 times on that boat.
How do you get so much ass?
You get a fucking dazzle with bullshit, fucker.
What do you think?
Is that a gorgeous guy?
Fucking no, fuck no.
But remember, they all know about the cock.
The nine and a half by what?
Nine and a half by five and three quarters.
So what did you do after the boat sink?
Where did you live?
I mean, you had to have found a place to live after that.
What'd you do?
Fuck, I really don't remember, dude.
I fucking...
I went straight to fucking hell, probably.
Probably 34th Street a couple nights.
49th Street?
No, fuck.
Oh yeah, I went to 49th Street.
What happened there?
Well, because...
Oh yeah, I gotta...
Somebody fuck...
Yup, somebody put some kind of stuff inside of a drink to where I was dripping my fucking balls off.
Yup.
And what, you got arrested?
Nope, they went to go find me help.
Who did?
The coppers, because I could not get out of the middle of the street after Jefferson's...
So what did they do to help you?
They took me to 49th Street and then they took me to...
Yup, I wasn't under arrested, but god damn it.
They said they were just gonna give me some more help.
So here comes help after I go to the jail.
And then I fucking...
Then here come the ambulance people and...
Help was over with.
Fucking...
Yup, they strapped me down decent.
They strapped you up?
Well yeah.
And where did they put you?
Over at the hospital.
Didn't you tell me that...
Guess what kind of fucking amazing question they asked?
What was the hardest question in the world?
What?
What was my name?
Fucking god damn it.
You were so out of it you couldn't remember it.
Fuck no.
Fucking...
Goober Werber.
Fuck yeah.
Didn't you tell me that one day you were...
Fuck yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, fuck yeah.
God damn it.
Let's get this shit down, fuckers.
Let's get it down.
Fucking come on, fucking busies.
Let's do this.
Yeah, come on, let's talk some more shit.
Shane, didn't you tell me that you were tripping on acid one day
and the cops took you to 49th Street and they...
They put on a laser light show or something.
We can't talk about this because that's the same adventure.
Well, we gotta talk about it.
We gotta tell it.
We have to tell all the stories.
You can't get in trouble.
That's in the past.
Because I want them all to be my friends.
They are your friends.
They love you, everybody loves you.
The people out there, they want to know this shit, Shane.
Well, this is all stay friends.
Yeah, well all stay friends.
Yep.
Just tell us basically what happened.
I got fucked up.
And?
My friends at 49th Street helped me out so much.
Just even a nurse.
I fucking, I love her so much.
Whoever that nurse was that night, I fucking totally adore her.
Because she, I was just...
Am I in trouble?
And she was like, no, we're just going to get you some help.
And that's all I heard all night from the beginning.
Little bit of help.
Oh, Shane.
Holy fuck, I need some help.
Help!
I need some goddamn help.
Fuck it.
Am I crazy?
Hell no.
You tell me.
Everybody's crazy.
I want you to tell me that story.
Yeah, I think I'm perfectly normal.
I think you're all the fucking same.
Fuck it.
I want you to fucking tell me that goddamn story, Shane.
What story?
The one that you told me when the cops put you in a room with the lights in the car.
Fuck, I can't tell this.
Why?
Nope.
Why?
Are you scared?
What are you afraid of?
Are you scared to tell a story?
Are you fucking creeps?
No, I just don't want to get in trouble.
We just want to tell good stories.
Nope, I know, but...
There's my Marilyn Manson picture!
Alright, let's talk about Marilyn Manson.
What is Marilyn Manson to you?
Stop, Donald!
Who is a goddamn butt?
Fuck yeah.
I remember that old part of that skit.
Fuck yeah.
It's okay.
What happened to the laser lights in the car machine?
We gotta tell some stories on here.
Oh my god, I lost everything.
God damn it.
How did you feel when you figured out that the boat was sinking?
Were you on it when it sunk?
No, I was out fishing.
And then what, you just came back and the boat was sinking?
Gone.
So what do you do?
You show up to the dock and your boat's sunken?
Well, that fucking sucked.
Right, but...
Oh, it sucked.
So what happened right then?
What do you do?
Everything you own is sunk in the water, right?
Yeah, I know, the fucking...
The one dude was bitching at me to fucking...
Have it taken a fucking...
He was a creep, dude.
Who was?
The guy that owned the dock or what?
Yeah, dockmaster.
I lost everything I fucking owned right there.
Except for that flag.
I got that.
Okay, let's get down.
We can't hear you because you're on the mic.
Okay.
Well, I got all them videos back.
Fuck yeah.
Of course, because they were in my fucking emergency fucking landing kit.
What about the speakers?
I lost them pornos, but the speakers, yeah.
You got the 901s?
But I got the 901s.
I got the 901s, but I didn't get the fucking pro studios.
Fuck.
Did you get the laser lights?
No.
Oh, nope.
No, but I got the Iron Maiden flag.
I got fucking...
The numchocks?
No.
Did you get the Marilyn Manson signed picture?
Yep.
Yeah, it's all fucking smoked with Ozzy's picture.
And you said you lost all the pornos?
Yeah, but I bought more.
Oh, you bought more?
Where do you buy pornos?
Where'd you get them from?
Goddamn fucking looking hustler magazine.
Buy 15 for fucking $4.
Yeah, but you had DVDs.
Fuck yeah.
That's what I got.
DVD.
Fuck with VCR with fucking HIV with BVD fucking HIV.
I didn't know people still bought porn DVDs.
LMB fucking PRX fucking DVR fucking DVCDA or whatever the fuck.
You got them all.
Did I do it?
You got them all, right?
Fuck yeah.
I knew I would do it.
So how's your love life, Shane?
Who you got?
You hitched up right now?
You got a girl?
Yeah, because every time I see Shane Lee, he is always with a pretty good looking girl.
Yeah, how do you get such good looking chicks?
Every time we pull love.
There's no offense, but you're not the prettiest dude.
Is it your personality?
You got money?
Fuck yeah.
No, I ain't got no money fucking.
I'm gonna go with B.
B, what's B?
Personality.
Fuck yeah.
B is nine by five and three quarter.
Oh, well, that's the trick, huh?
That's the trick, huh?
That's from Deck.
Oh, that's option D.
Option D, yeah.
Where's Georgia?
Georgia.
It's up there past fucking Florida to the right.
To the north.
That's another.
See, Shane's got all these things we can't talk about.
That's why Shane's hard to interview because the fame went to his head and now he won't
talk about certain things.
Now we can't tell all the good fucking stories anymore because he's already blown up and
gone big time, so.
And acts like he knows nobody.
No, I get in fucking trouble.
What?
You're gonna get in trouble.
You're gonna get in trouble for telling us the truth about how some guy sprayed your
bunk bed with a raid and you almost died.
You can't even tell that.
Yeah, fuck that guy, bro.
He tried to kill you.
Well, I don't.
Yep.
He sure does.
So do I have to tell the story for you?
No, no, no, no.
Don't go into that.
Okay.
We already spit that out, so it's good enough.
What story can we tell?
What kind of stories can we tell the fans, the people?
It's not for me and Danny.
It's for...
I just want to say to all of our fucking fans here that, yep, fucking, captains are fucking
crooks, criminals are fucking, there's a lot of bad people out there.
The boat captains?
Why do you say that?
Yeah, but there's so many fucking great ones.
I mean, what is it like in this?
Just like, fucking, one of my favorite is Jeff.
And Ricky Naves, fucking Danny Deal, Scott Daggett, fucking Randy.
There's so many fucking great ass captains out there.
Yeah.
But then there's a lot of rotten ones that I don't even want to say their fucking names.
So let's not say their names, but why are they rotten?
What are they doing?
Are they not cutting out the money right or what?
Let's not go into that whole fishing thing, because I thought we were here to have a funny
ass event.
We are.
We got to get you to tell some sort of story.
This is what we got to do, because what we're going to do for everybody, fuckers, we're
going to make a brand new goddamn Facebook, fucking.
All right.
For Shane Lee.
At the end of this podcast, we're going to make you a new Facebook.
All right.
Shane, start making a...
Can you do this?
We're going to make you...
Oh yeah, fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah.
So you guys know how to do this shit, fuck it.
We got it.
And so what are we going to do on the Facebook though?
You're going to talk to the fans or what?
We just want to get so many...
If you like me, hit me up on Facebook.
Everybody loves you.
Come on, right?
If you hate me, don't hit me up on Facebook.
But if you like me on this Facebook that we're going to do, hit it up, right?

Oh my God, the fucking mic is always going up.

Well...

We're fucking...
We're talking about nothing.
God damn, man.

Do you want to hear the fucking...
Tell me something you want to talk about.

We're interested in some shit and you don't want to tell us.
Super secret chain now.
Well.
Okay.
Let me ask you this.
Why are you so secretive?
Are the people giving you shit for the Deccan series or what?
Fuck it.
I love my fucking Deccan series.
If there's anybody out there that hates me, just go ahead and don't watch it.
It's a fucking simple.
Does anybody ever say anything about it?
Everybody fucking loves me.
Everybody loves it.
Nothing negative.
Fuck yeah.
Nobody ever says anything.
There's a few negatives.
Why?
What did they say?
Nine and a half by five and three quarters it's just all round.
Fuck them.
Fuck the haters.
Are all Deccans fishermen?
Fuck.
Are all Deccans in Madeira Beach commercial fishermen?
Are they like you?
Or are they normal people?
There's no one like me.
I can't wait for the nights with me.
That answers that.
Fuck yeah.
I am one of my own.
You are one of a kind for sure.
But thank you fuckers.
Absolutely.
And definitely my favorite Deccan of all time.
You're definitely the coolest dude we know.
Fuck yeah, fuckers.
Right back at you and everybody that loves me, fuck yeah.

We're just here from the Junction 666 and we're just trying to fucking get by.
Just show them.
So 666 is what?
The beast.
The Madeira Beach.
It's all cool, fucking.
So how is the commercial fishing industry doing now?
If you were to...
I don't know.
I don't care.
You don't hear anything about it?
Nope, I'm fucking here to fucking clean up Red Tide.
You're done with fishing.
What happens when the Red Tide goes away?
What are you going to do?
Go back to fishing.
Do you make good money cleaning up the beaches?
Yeah, I'm fucking with a great bunch of people.
And they put me on a great ass equipment and it's just fun.
How did you get into it?
Because I'm tired of fishing and I met somebody at some bar and all of a sudden he said if
you wanted to clean up Red Tide I was like fuck yeah because I can't stand the smell of it anymore
because I'm a Madeira Beach motherfucker.
Fuck yeah.com.
Yup, and so I had to help make a little community and these people, I can't even say the name.
That's alright, we can leave them anonymous.
Yup, but they fucking, they are the ones.
But they're taking care of you.
They got you a nice room down there.
They're paying you good.
They got you the fucking water suit.
Whatever I want.
If I want to go down there to the condo and live, sure I got a room.
No bullshit.
I just paid my own but they paid me a check.
First check I've had in my life.
Yeah.
Did I talk about this?
Yeah, no, let's get into it.
This is the first check you ever had.
No bullshit.
You got your first check.

So how do you cash a check?
So I fucking go the next day, go fucking to the bank where the check is from.
Guess what happened?
I handed my ID, my Social Security card, two forms of ID.
My ID has expired.

But who the fuck am I now?
Fuckers.
So what do you do?
God damn it.
Who the fuck am I?
I'm not Shane Lee anymore after 2016.
So did you go back to him and tell him to give you cash?
Fuck it.
No, I had to go to the goddamn fucking DMV and get a brand new ID to cash that motherfucker
check.

Whoever you want to be.

That's fucked up.
Why?
You don't have to say it.
Just tell me why you don't want to talk about it.
Because I'm gonna handle this in my own way.
Why?
You seem to get like really upset when we talk about it.
Well because I really want to beat this fucking ass.
And that's understandable.
I would too.
Anybody would.
That's not, that's not, you're not to blame for that.
I really want to beat this fucking ass.
I would too.
Yeah.
You'd call me raid.
Right.
I want to just for seeing what he did to you.
If anybody tried to kill you, of course you'd want to do that.
I mean that's...
I mean...
Maybe he didn't tend to go there.
Don't kill Shane.
Come on man.
Maybe he didn't tend to go there.
No.
Am I the bad guy?
Dude would you go and want to kill me?
No.
Fuck no.
Fuck no.

Fuck yeah.
Everybody loves you.
Everybody wants to protect you at all costs.
You're fucking...
You're the biggest thing in your beach.
Everybody knows you and loves you.
So the guy, the guy for some reason doesn't like you and sprays your bedroom with fucking
bug spray.
Yeah.
Fuck a piece of shit.
And but you don't even know.
So you sleep in it and a couple months go by and your arms are swollen up like they
got in a fucking forest fire.
Look at them just starting to get better.
I mean...
Right.
I mean really fucking they're not better.
Yeah go over there.
The camera's over there so the camera can see you over there.
Okay.
So look at how the fucking thing just starts.
I mean usually I am dark as fuck.
Yeah.
I mean...
Here sit in your chair so we can see you better.
The cameras can't see you if you're standing.
Yeah the light doesn't get you over there.
Yeah.
So fucking I'm usually dark as fuck.
Yeah.
I mean really for...
I'm not bullshitting you.
I am dark.
But this is what I got after that.
Yeah so a couple months go by and then what you can't even get up and walk right?
No.
Right.
You're just fucking stuck.
Why couldn't you walk?
You're so sick that you can't even get up.
Poison.
But you don't know it's poison yet.
No.
You think you're allergic to something.
No.
And then so when do you find out that you've been poisoned?
He gives you a call and lets you know what really happened right?
Yep.
And he tells you that somebody sprayed the bunk with fucking raid bug spray.
Okay.
It's a sabotage.
All right scratch.
Stop.
We're not going to name nobody.
Okay.
We're not going to name nobody.
Stop.
We got to get something bro.
Nope.

I got fucking, I bought a gun.
I was going to shoot myself in the fucking head.
I was so fucking sick.
I couldn't walk.
Nothing.
I'm not shooting you.
I was going to blow my fucking head off.
But I left the bullets at the goddamn fucking dock.
I was going to fucking shoot myself.
No bullshit.
You were in that much pain?
If we want to get down to this, this is exactly what happened.
I wanted to shoot myself.
I fucking couldn't stand anymore.
I'm so glad you didn't.
All right now let's stop this whole part of that goddamn interview.
All right?
