We're on the concrete podcast, and today's guest is Tampa Tony.
Tampa Tony.
How's it going, man?
Hey, man, it's a beautiful thing, man.
Finally free.
Finally free.
Back on the road.
Back on the road.
So for the people out there who may not comprehend,
the short summary of what's been going on with you
is I think in 2006, you were convicted to life in prison.
And two days ago, you were just released
and you were pardoned by Obama.
Is that right?
Yeah.
So Shane actually told me about you
and you used to have a music career.
Yeah, yeah.
Me and a few buddies, we used to record music,
local studios around here in St. Pete and whatnot,
and your name was popping back then.
It was buzzing.
So everybody knew Tampa Tony.
And then I heard you went away.
Then years and years went by, and I happened to see an article
that you got your sentence commuted by Obama.
And then you was getting out, so I started looking you up,
and you're free.
I said, we got to get them on.
We got to have the story.
Yeah, man, it was beautiful, man.
It was beautiful.
So where did it start?
Are you born in Florida?
Yeah, Florida born.
Tampa?
Well, I was born in Orlando, raised in Tampa.
All right.
And then so when did music start?
Music started when I really got into it.
It really started like maybe I was like 13, 14
when I started DJing.
That was like the beginning of it.
When I started DJing, and I went from DJing
and went on one show with my cousin.
He had a big record back in the days called
It's My Catalact.
His name was NasD.
Went on the road with him and seen the following that he had.
And on the way back, I was like, man, I'm for the rap.
He was like, what?
I was like, yeah, I'm rapping now, man.
I seen you getting the limo.
We got in the limo and the big crowds and stuff like that.
I was like, yeah, I'm going to rap, man.
And did you work with a lot of big artists?
I mean, obviously you got pretty popular back then.
So how did you blow up like that?
We had a DJ crew in Tampa called Rocket Rod DJs.
And we kind of controlled the market
because there wasn't no radio stations in Tampa back then.
The only thing that was up was WTMP 88.5.
It wasn't no big stations like 94.1 or yeah.
So it was before that.
We kind of like broke a lot of records in our area
because of the mixtapes, you know what I mean?
Like the slowdown.
We was known for the slowdown music right there.
And then we seen your son with Trick Daddy.
I know that was popular.
I know Trick from way back because his uncle
was managing my cousin at the time.
So I met him way back then, but he was like in the streets.
He wasn't rapping, man.
He was coming from jail, doing freestyles and like,
he don't take it serious.
But once he came out, you know, I already knew him.
So I start breaking his music in the Tampa Bay area.
You know, I'll play a lot of Trick.
And that's how we came together.
And then he seen me back in the rap business
and he was like, look, man, everywhere I'm going,
I'm hearing your name, man.
I mean, you making some noise.
It's like we got to do a record together.
I was like, whenever.
No way.
Yeah.
So he was like, man, I'm gonna call you tomorrow.
So he got my number.
He called me the next day.
He's like, man, when you can't even come down.
And I was like, man, I'm always free.
So that's wild.
And this was like, was this was like before
so like Instagram and yeah.
This was before Instagram and Twitter and all that.
That's it was none of that.
That's wild.
Yeah.
And what year was that?
You did the Trick Daddy song.
I did the Trick Daddy song.
And I want to say 2005.
2005.
Yeah.
2005.
And the year after that is when you got arrested.
When I got arrested.
So what else were you doing besides music?
I invented, I invented this thing called a blunt splitter.
The splitter.
The splitter.
I saw that.
What is that?
It's you slide the cigar through
and it splits it down the middle.
Oh no way.
Okay.
So you can pull all the tobacco out.
You can pull all tobacco out.
So it's like a clean cut.
You don't have to use your nails.
I see those in gas stations and stuff now all the time.
So it was, I pushed it a lot before I went in
and when I lost trial, they kind of used that in my trial
to saying that I was using drug proceeds
to fund the splitter.
So it kind of like, you know, messed everything up
with that, but I still had the patent.
Right.
So once guys seen that it was so hot
because it was in the Hot Times magazine,
it was, I was getting a lot of publicity from it.
No way.
Yeah.
So did you make some good money off that?
Yeah, I made some good money, but once they came in,
it's like when I got locked up,
other companies seen, oh, he locked up.
He can't do nothing.
He got a life sentence.
So ain't nobody else doing nothing.
So we come out with our own.
You know, they just change the pattern up just a little bit
and they went to work, man.
So you're doing some serious.
How old were you in that, like in 2005?
In 2005, I think I was like 26.
And you were getting patents for fucking shit
that you created and you were making serious money.
So you were like legit businessman in your 20s.
Yeah, yeah.
That's wild.
And then what was going on?
Like what were you doing illegally?
Illegally, I was, it was like the marijuana, the cocaine.
You know, it was just like being a part of the streets
and funding, it really, actually funding everything.
You know what I mean?
Like for my group, my label, the splitter
and like really marketing myself, you know what I mean?
I was taking the money just putting it back into my brain.
So the goal was to get the money and fund your other businesses.
And fund my other business and the music at the same time
and stay under dependent.
You know, I was thinking about Master P.
Right.
You know, everybody wanted to be like, OK,
I want to be independent.
Instead of having a label deal, I can just do everything myself,
you know, brand myself.
So that's what I was doing.
So without like, you know, obviously saying any names
or anything, like how, how, what, tell me the story
of how you got into the drug business.
The drug business was, it was, it's been my background.
You know, like a lot of my people has been in the drug business.
I've been affiliated with the streets.
But, you know, sometimes I leave to try to do the right thing.
You know what I mean?
And it kind of slowed down.
The money slowed down.
So now that I'm trying to do something big and brand myself,
now I needed the extra funds to do that.
So you had to start increasing the scale of the stuff
you were hustling.
Yeah.
So I increased the scale of it.
So like your friends and the people around you,
is that how you got into it?
Were they selling weed and coke and stuff?
And that's how you got into it.
A couple of them was, you know, a couple of them was,
it like we, I started in the streets.
You know what I mean?
Just like, you know, small things, nickel and diamond.
And then I'll leave and go straight to the DJing.
And then, you know, money will slow down a little bit.
Then I'll go back.
So it was like a back and forth thing.
You know, it was nothing serious.
You know what I mean?
Then I was like, well, if I'm going to do it,
I'll take it to the next level.
You know what I mean?
So I just went ahead and took it to the next level.
How do you step it up?
Like, what's the leap you take?
What's the next level?
Like, how do you get to the next level?
Well, just you kind of like meet different individuals.
And, you know, and it went from there to, OK, well,
now you're taking your money and you buying more.
So you're going to buy more, you know,
and saving up money, buying more and more.
And then all of a sudden you increase your supply.
And now it's like the demand is always going to be there.
Yeah.
Do you remember when you bought like your first kilo
weed or kilo of Coke?
Like, tell me that.
Tell me, like, what was that like?
Like, what were you doing?
What were you going through your head?
Like, you know.
Or was it a pound?
What was it, you know what I mean?
Like, when I bought my first pound,
it was like, you know, like I graduated from buying
little small things to something bigger now.
You know, and now it's like, OK, save your money
and don't spend it and go, you know, keep growing.
You know, even with the same thing in the music,
you know, my mentality has been the same way.
It's like, bring yourself and put your money
to the side and then invest it back into yourself.
Right.
You know, so that's what I did.
This kept different steps, high steps.
Yeah.
So you had to just keep flipping on the bigger things.
Yeah, to bigger things.
Wow.
And then what was the transition like from weed to cocaine?
Or did you always have both?
No, I started out in the Coke business as a young kid.
You know, I was younger when I started that.
But it was just like little small things, little cut rocks.
But then when I got back in and graduated to that,
it was like a major level.
It's different.
The money is different.
What do you mean?
The money, the Coke money is faster.
It's faster?
Yeah, and it's more.
You know what I mean?
Like, what it would take you to make 10 grand in marijuana
would only take, you know, like one or two keys in Coke,
you know what I mean, or less, you know what I mean?
And it's much smaller, too.
Yeah.
So, I mean, at that point, it's easier to move.
Even to move, and it ain't that bulky,
and it ain't the smell, you know, the smell.
So did you prefer selling Coke versus weed?
I didn't.
I really didn't want to do neither.
Right.
Obviously, obviously not.
I didn't want to do neither, right.
But you were trying to do what you had to do.
Yeah, I had a dream, and I wanted to.
Because I dealt with a lot of individuals
like they told me they would invest.
You know, other individuals that had money,
that they would invest in my brand.
Right.
And when it got down to it, they never did it,
because something came up, and they lost some money.
So they was never able to do that.
So it was like, now and never, OK,
I'm going to take it in my own hands to do that.
You know what I mean?
I felt the need for me to do that myself.
Yeah.
Was there like a stopping point you had in your head?
Like, I'm going to get to this much money, and then that's it?
I had a plan.
Yeah, what was your goal?
Like, what was your monetary goal?
My goal was to get to a million dollars.
Right.
And I was going to be, that was it.
Yeah.
And at the time when I was getting to that point,
I looked at it was the splitter.
I had the splitter, and I had got that so huge
that I was offered like 1.5 for the splitter.
No way, yeah.
So my mind thinking like this, like, OK,
I can get to the million, and I can get to 1.5,
and leave the walk away with like 1.2 or 1.1
with the lawyer fees and all that.
Now my money's clean, because I can show where the million
dollars go from here.
Where you made that money from, yeah.
So I can keep that in there and just spend the street money
to brand everything.
You see what I'm saying?
So that was my whole point.
That was my whole goal.
Like, OK, if I could get right like this,
and I can tell the splitter, I got OK.
I know the splitter was like my baby.
Yeah.
You know, and I was like, OK, well, I can sell it off,
and then become legit, and have enough fun
to push myself all the way.
And then that was my ultimate goal.
So at that point, the splitter's blown up.
You've got to offer.
Yeah.
Then so why don't you sell it?
Is that when you get jammed up?
Yeah, well, his lawyer and my lawyer
was going back and forth with the paperwork,
and the contracts, and everything.
And it was taking like, I think it was like,
it was maybe in like three weeks into it,
and it was going back and forth.
He was like, it's going to be like two more weeks,
and it'll be finalized.
And y'all can come and sign, and it'll be on.
So before those two weeks was up,
that's when I caught the charge.
That's when it happened.
Yeah, and when it happened, he went in a separate way.
He's probably one of the guys that got all the little small
splitters out right now.
Yeah, right?
Probably took it.
So you get jammed up at that point.
Is this like, I mean, you got the splitter deal on the line.
So why are you still selling the drugs?
Why not give it up?
Or is this your last one?
Is it like, I got the splitter.
This is my last one.
This is my last one, because I'm trying
to get to that million dollar goal.
If I can get to this million dollar goal, then,
and I sell the splitter, then I'm good.
Even if I don't get it, and once the splitter is sold,
I'm done, you know what I mean?
But is it that easy to exit the drug business like that?
Because you just tell your people,
the guys who are supplying you, just
that I'm out or whatever, and that's fine?
Well, it's not fine, because they'll continue to hassle you.
Like, man, we need you.
You know, I didn't save no money.
Man, just give us a little more run,
or turn me on to the people, and this and that.
And you look at it like, OK, look,
I have to make an exit some type of way.
So my whole plan was just tell them, like, dude, just stop.
You know what I mean?
So I'm not in it no more.
Right.
So I'm just waiting.
You know, just let them play the game, you know what I mean?
Till they just move on to somebody else.
Till they just move to somebody else.
You know what I mean?
Just keep pushing them off to somebody else.
Yeah.
So that was my whole plan.
Wow.
So then that's around 06, and you get jammed up.
Yeah, well, when you actually got jammed up,
what was that day like?
What was going on that?
Can you walk me through that day?
That day, the individual that was my connect, he was a Mexican.
He called and told me he was ready for me.
I made him out in Pasco County.
And are you expecting that call?
Is that either ordinary or?
Well, no, we had talked that night.
So it was like that morning, I'm going to go into the truck
and get everything, and then we'll meet.
So I was like, OK, cool.
So when he came to meet me, it was a strange feeling
that I had.
But I'm just trying to move fast, because I had to be in Miami.
So I'm like.
Right.
Why is it a strange feeling?
Again, your stomach, like you just had like a.
Yeah, like it's like.
You just have one of the moments.
One of the old moments, like, you know, you're like, man,
this is not, you shouldn't do that.
You know what I mean?
Maybe.
No, you don't need to do that right now.
You know what I mean?
And I was, I didn't listen.
I didn't listen.
I didn't listen.
So I end up making the deal.
And how much was it?
It was 21 kilos.
And so where is this at?
A house or at a parking lot?
We was in a parking lot.
OK.
We was in a parking lot.
Like a gas station parking lot or?
No, it was Sam's Club parking lot.
OK.
Yeah, Sam's Club parking lot.
Wow.
And how do you do that exchange, just in two cars in a bag?
Normally, we have never done that.
And I was just going to meet him up there
and then follow him back, or he followed me back to a place.
OK.
My house or something like that.
But it's like he just, it happened so fast.
He just shows up and you have it there.
Yeah, he just showed up and he jumped out and like popped
your trunk and I'm like, yo, man, we hear it, man.
And he was like, no, we are, we are, right?
You know, that's the main man.
That's the big man right there.
And this and that.
And Blythe Squad was there and the guy said something.
Like they got pretty stamps on them or something
shit like that.
And it kind of like spooked me.
That's when I woke up then.
Pretty stamps?
He's like, yeah, they got good stamps on them.
I was like, good stamps.
What is, what are you talking about?
Right, what does that mean?
Yeah, what does that mean?
So I went in the car to get, I had this thing called a spy
catcher and it detects bugs.
Oh, no shit.
So I went in the car to grab that.
It was up under the seat because I went to Sam's Club
early and I took it off of me because they had to keep
going off with all the stuff in there.
With all the stuff in there.
So I took it off him.
So I went to grab it and police came from everywhere.
I thought I was grabbing a gun.
No fucking way.
So he puts the bag in your trunk and you go to get your
little detector to check it out.
That's not just a bag though.
21 keys, you can't fit, can you fit that in a backpack?
Yeah, it's not like a suitcase, it was a suitcase.
So then you go and grab that and then all of a sudden what?
You hear somebody say freeze or?
Everywhere.
Everywhere.
I'm like, what the fuck y'all come from?
You by yourself?
Yeah, I'm by myself.
You by yourself?
Yeah, I'm like, man, what the fuck y'all come from?
Like, well y'all gonna put under the car?
Right.
Yeah.
How many of them?
Like 20.
20.
With ARs and all type of shit.
And I'm like, man, what the fuck are they, where they come
from, man?
Yeah, it was crazy, man.
That's crazy.
So that moment, you know it's all over.
Yeah, and one of the officers tell me, he was like, yeah,
you'll never wrap again.
And you know, that's still with me for the whole bit.
At that point, do you know you got set up or you just
think you'll get busted?
I know I got set up because the guy even said it.
He said it, the guy that set me up.
Mexican dude?
Yeah, he was like, man, he wasn't supposed to know that I did
this.
Yeah.
And you know, that was like, fuck you.
Right, that'll kill a fuck, right?
They don't care?
Yeah, they don't give a fuck.
They was like, yeah, fuck you.
So what happened to him?
He got off or he do a little light sentence?
He came and testified against me.
He only got like, I think he only did like three or four
years in jail.
Three or four years in prison, yeah.
I ain't told him that.
In trial, he told him that's all he's going to ever do.
That's it?
Yeah, he was like, I'm a drug dealer.
That's all I'm ever do.
He was like, well, if you get out of this,
when you get out of prison, because you're going to prison,
what are you going to do?
He was like, what I've been doing all my life.
So he was like, you're going to continue in this,
even if you come in to testify on this individual for that
and then you're going to still continue in this.
He was like, yeah.
So.
That's wild.
In the article, I was reading some sort of one article
yesterday, and they were talking about somebody in Arizona
that was involved with it.
Who was that?
Is that your connector?
Yeah, that was the main man.
I had all started with the truck driver
was leaving Tampa with.
Move your mic a little bit.
You can move it.
The truck driver was leaving Tampa with $1.1 million
in his truck, and he was going through Texas.
The authorities pulled him over in Texas.
With the money?
With the money.
He immediately went to cooperate with the authorities.
They take the money and they let him go.
Then he go and see the big man.
And the big man tell him, he tell the big man
that the police took my money.
So he's like, OK, go back to Tampa
and pick up some more money for my son-in-law.
So he goes back.
And he goes back to pick up more money and he come back.
But the whole time, he's wearing a wire.
No way.
Yeah.
So the big guy tell him, well, I'm going to go back to Mexico
and I'm going to get some more work.
And I'm going to have you take it back down there.
So he was like, OK.
And this truck, what happened to this truck driver?
The truck driver never seen a day in jail.
Really?
Yeah, he never seen a day in jail.
The guy that got pulled over with the money.
Yeah, he never seen a day in jail.
So he sets up the next dude.
He sets up.
He the one he sets up the father-in-law and the son-in-law.
He sets them up.
And then that trickles down to you.
The son-in-law sets me up.
Holy shit, they had a whole fucking.
Yeah.
So did they offer you a deal to set somebody else up?
They came with me with a deal, but my morals of street
is like I'm all the way against that.
Right, for sure.
I was taught like, hey, man, whatever you do, you did it.
Take your lick and keep taking it.
And that's how it goes in the street code.
But a lot of people, when it comes to that time,
they don't live up by it.
Yeah, it has changed so drastically now.
It's like a lot of people like glorify snitching.
I mean, I'm not against those people.
I just don't want nothing to deal with them.
I mean, if I have to deal with them,
then it's not on nothing that we can get caught up.
Hey, man, we could do business, but not that type of business.
You know what I mean?
Because at the same time, I'm always
feel like if you're getting a jam,
I could be the one that you can.
Because it could be anything from a conversation.
Yeah, it could be anything from a conversation.
You can tell me, hey, man, I'm for the brain.
I need a couple beers over there.
Man, what you going to do?
And because you are informed and out of prison for drugs,
they can interpret that conversation as, oh,
he tell me I'm bringing drugs.
And there it is.
I'm back in prison again.
Yeah.
Of some so simple.
All right, so they offer you a deal.
So do you take it to trial or you plead out?
No, I go to trial.
You go to trial.
And I'm sure they offer you a plea deal, right?
No, they never offer me a plea deal.
Wow.
They never offer me a plea deal.
So they wanted to take it straight to trial.
They felt like they were winning trial.
So you go to trial.
How long does that go on for?
Because that can go off for a year.
Three days.
Three days.
Speedy trial.
Wow.
Speedy trial.
Why so fast?
You wanted to do it that fast?
Well, when we were going to trial, it took like 10 months
before the trial started.
Yeah.
And then when it finally started,
it was only like a three day trial.
It was an incident in the trial where one of the jurors
brought something in from offline and showed it to the jury.
Like some information about you?
Yeah, like he was in my favor trying to tell him.
So he was like, they dismissed him
without us being present.
So that was like a real big point
that could have got me a new trial.
But my lawyer, he didn't do it.
He did no great job.
So are you paying for a good lawyer at that time?
Or you think it's a good lawyer?
Yeah.
I mean, he's a good lawyer.
But lawyers are good in certain areas.
Like he's a good plea lawyer.
And going to get bills, not a trial lawyer.
At least not a drug trial.
Right, right.
You know what I mean?
So his specialty is pleas and sentences.
Getting you a deal.
Yeah.
All right, so you don't get a plea deal.
You go to trial.
Do you think you're going to win at trial?
Are you in good hopes at that time?
Yeah, I'm hoping because I'm trying to beat the conspiracy.
OK, so what are all the charges you're going up for?
Five keys or more of cocaine.
What it is?
Intent to distribute.
Yeah, intent to distribute.
And then what they have you on a conspiracy also?
All of it was conspiracy.
All of it, OK.
Yeah, all of it was conspiracy.
And what they did also, they gave me another charge.
It was 100 kilos of marijuana.
Well, he told them we had been dealing marijuana as well.
But it was no marijuana.
The thing was is when they got the kilos in Arizona,
they swapped them out and put sheet rock.
OK.
So this is what we was arguing.
I'm like, how are you going to charge me for?
For not actually buying cocaine.
No cocaine.
So that day when you met that guy,
that was actually sheet rock?
It was sheet rock.
So that's why they get you on a conspiracy charge?
That's why they get you on a conspiracy.
So they can't get you with the actual purchase.
They can't get you with the actual purchase, yeah.
So it was all sheet rock.
So that's why the conspiracy kind of like ties you're
trying to say that you knew before that or y'all
dealt beforehand.
So that was the whole thing of proving in court.
Like y'all dealt beforehand.
It could have been a buyer-seller relationship.
It couldn't have been anything else besides a conspiracy.
Because the conspiracy is so broad.
So broad.
And they found a way to pin 10 kilos of marijuana on it.
Well, they put 100 kilos of marijuana.
100 kilos.
100 kilos of marijuana.
So I beat that count.
That's the only count I beat.
But the more severe count I didn't beat.
Which is the conspiracy intent to distribute in the cocaine.
Yeah, five kilos or more.
That's wild.
So you're going to trial and you know you're up against life
at that point.
If you lose?
Yeah, because the prosecutor was like, it was a female.
And she was like, if you don't tell, you're going to get life.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
So I'm like, well, we got to win trial.
Who did she want you to tell her?
I don't know.
She just wanted me to.
She just wanted you to give up somebody.
Because you got to understand like everybody from my side
that I was dealing with was never seen, heard of, or nothing.
So he telling them all these numbers that we was doing.
So they trying to figure out where all this stuff was going.
So what was going on?
Where all this stuff was going.
And obviously you know where it's going.
Yeah, so like who you was giving it to.
Who you were selling it to and all that.
I'm like, man, I don't know what y'all were talking about.
I mean, there's a street code, man.
A lot of people can't.
A lot of people are calling me stupid.
Like, you were stupid, man.
Why would you do that?
Why would you just take life like that?
Because it's moral, certain things that you stand on.
You know what I mean?
And that's what I stood on.
You got to stand for something.
You know what I mean?
And now the days it's like snitching.
It's like a video game.
Right, nobody knows that nowadays.
Everybody playing.
You know what I mean?
It's crazy.
That's crazy.
So three days and the judge put the gavel down.
Put the gavel down.
Life.
Life.
So before it's getting read, do you
like kind of know which way it's going?
Yeah, I had a feeling.
I'm like, damn, life's not looking good.
Yeah, so when he sentenced me, what was going through my head,
I was like, I got to sentence you to life.
So I tapped the lawyer.
I'm like, life is what?
Like 25 years?
Right.
You know what I mean?
He was like, no, life in the feds is until you die.
So I'm like, until I die in the feds, he was like, yeah,
what you thought?
25 years, he was like, they would have said 25 years.
He'd say, that's state.
Yeah.
He was like, in the feds, life is life until you die in prison.
So I was like, whoa.
No shit.
Yeah.
So he was all saying all type of shit.
Yeah, now where you got at now?
You know what I'm saying?
Man.
God damn.
Yeah, he was like, yeah, where you got at now?
God damn, man.
That's my lawyer.
Yeah.
Yeah, what he was saying.
Yeah, man, where you got at now?
Y'all worship this fake God.
Where is he now?
And so you're going to try, where is this at?
Is this in Tampa?
Yeah, in Tampa.
Hillsborough County?
Yeah, Hillsborough County.
And then so it comes back, you're guilty.
They sent you to your life.
Then where do they take you from there?
Straight to the feds?
Yep, I go behind the gate, behind the wall, so to say.
It's like, first time in prison, in the feds,
they have certain custody levels.
They have the Supermax, which is like ADX.
It's like the killers, like the murderers and stuff.
This your first time?
This is my first time ever in prison.
Ever.
Jail prison.
Well, I done been to jail for like tickets.
Sure.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, but anything.
This your first time doing some time.
Yeah, so I'm thinking like, OK, well, man, I go to Lowe.
And they're like, no, people with life sentences
don't go to Lowe.
No.
It was like, the less you can go to is a medium.
So I'm like, well, we had a medium.
He was like, yeah, and one of the guys that was there with me,
I knew him from back in the day.
He was like, bro, you go into the penitentiary.
So I'm like, the penitentiary, he's like, listen, man,
when you hit the compound, you need to get you a knife.
So I'm like, a knife?
I'm like, for what?
What I need a knife for?
He said, listen, bro, you go into the penitentiary
and it's a lot of violence.
Everything is kind of like categorized in like gangs.
If you're not in the gang, you're in a car.
So you've got the Florida car, you've got the Georgia car,
you've got the Mississippi car, and then you've got
all these gangs, different gangs.
So what is that?
That's like little cliques, like cars?
Yeah, instead of calling it a gang, they call it a car
in the feds.
They call it a car.
So you're like, oh, you with the Florida car.
So they're not necessarily like a big gang,
but that's the Florida people.
It's the Florida people.
OK.
You know what I mean?
But the gangs, they got all the gangs.
You got the GDs, the BDs, you got the vice lords,
you got all the Mexican gangs, you got the ABs,
you got the dirty white boys.
There's so many gangs in prison.
It's ridiculous.
So it's like everybody is in that side of the section off.
So at any given point, if you with me and you
get into something and some guys jump you, I have to get in.
If I don't get in it, then they're
going to come and beat me up instead of me.
Oh, shit.
The guys that you were with.
The guys from Florida.
Because you ain't helping.
Because I ain't helping.
So if they're part of your crew, you've
got to jump in the fight.
No matter what it is, it could be something simple
like he owe money.
So I have to.
It's like I got to die for a person that I don't even know.
Yeah.
So what this guy tells you, you got to click up
with the Florida people?
He tell me that.
So I'm like, man, I ain't worried about that.
I'm not.
He's like, bro, listen, you're going to.
So when I get there, just like he said,
a guy come to me and say, yo, you need your paperwork.
I'm like, paperwork, what kind of paperwork?
He's like, we want to make sure you ain't no snitch.
And one of the other guys come up
that's over the Florida car.
He's the shot caller for the Florida car.
He was like, he good.
That's down for Tony.
He's like, he went to trial.
He got a life sentence.
So they already know who you are and everything.
Yeah, he already knew who I was.
They know who you are, what you did.
Never seen him do a damn my life.
But they know everything about you.
Yeah, he know everything.
He was like, yeah, he good.
He was like, make sure you go to the store
and get such and such and such.
So I'm like, for what?
He was like, somebody going to come see you
and they're going to bring you like two knives.
They're going to bring you one to float around with.
Like you can walk around with that.
They can't tell in the metadata.
And they're going to give you another one for the unit.
I'm like, what?
I'm like, man, what do I need a knife for?
He said, bro, they're not fighting.
He said, we get into anything with they're not fighting.
Nobody fights.
Nobody fights.
Everybody stabs.
Everybody stabs.
What kind of knife was it made out of metal?
No, the one that kept in the unit
was made out of a long screw.
So it was like an ice pick.
Okay.
It got like cloth wrapped around the end of it
and a handle on it.
They got it all ready to go.
They got it all ready to go.
The other one's like a thick piece of plexiglass.
And they had a shot.
That's what you carry with you.
That's what you carry with you.
So he showed me where to put it at.
In front of your khaki pants.
He cut the hole in the khaki pants and showed me how to...
I was like, man, this is another different world.
So I'm like...
That's your first day in.
My first day in.
Right.
So I'm like, man, this is crazy, man.
Holy shit, man.
So I'm like, man, so I'm like,
now I'm looking like, okay, well, what's going to happen?
I'm trying to see what's going on.
So like my second day, I seen...
It looked like they was jumping on a Mexican guy.
Like four other Mexican guys was jumping on the Mexican guy.
But they hitting them like this.
So I'm thinking they playing.
Yeah.
So when I seen, I'm like,
hey, what are they over there playing with dude?
So they was like, he turned around and he said,
hey, man, y'all scrap up, man.
So I'm like, scrap up, what's going on?
He's like, no, they stabbing dude.
It was like five dudes, but they hitting them like this.
Like overhand.
Yeah, overhand.
But the whole time they got the knife in the hand.
So that's what they stabbed.
So he's just getting stabbed up.
Yeah, he just getting stabbed up.
So I'm like, what the fuck?
And this is day two.
Day two.
Did he die?
No, he didn't die.
And he came across the field.
So when he come across the field,
I'm looking at him and he's like stumbling.
And he got his hand like this when he coming across.
Stout at the neck?
Yeah, so he does this and look at his hand
and the blood that's squirting out his neck.
So I'm like, what the fuck?
And he walking towards us.
So I'm like, man, what?
They're like, this chill, he gonna fall out before he get here.
So I'm like, what?
And everyone around you there, it's like no big deal.
Like no big deal.
Yeah, he gonna fall out before he get here.
That's chill, man.
He ain't got nothing to do with us.
And you just sit there and watch.
Just sit there and watch and he just fall out.
So when he fall, I jump up like,
he's like, no, you can't do nothing.
You gotta let him sit right there.
So I was like, man, he gonna let us let him in.
He's like, if you gonna touch him.
They're gonna do the same thing to you.
Yeah.
He's like, we gonna have to go.
Right, then you got a lot of enemies.
Yeah, he's like, yeah.
Now we gonna have to go against them.
So I was like, what?
So I got to sit down and just let this man.
So they call it the deuces when the alarms go off.
So the police ran out there.
They grabbed him, fixed him up.
And now we going to come out for the yard.
They want to check everybody's body search.
You got to take your shirt off.
They want to check for knives and all that.
So I'm like, yo, man, I got this.
They was like, give it here.
So they put it up under the table,
like in the dirt up under the table.
And we went through the checkpoint.
And it was like, from then on, I was like, man,
what the fuck am I?
Right.
And that's day two.
Day two.
And you got a long time to go.
I got a long time to go.
So this is going to be the regular shit every day.
This is going to be the regular shit every day.
Holy shit, man.
It's going to be the regular shit every day.
So then I start seeing it.
This is, what pen is this?
This is a Macquarie.
It's in Kentucky.
In Kentucky.
Okay.
Why up there?
Or is it just, how do they pick where you go to?
That's what it was saying.
It was like, they was wondering,
why they didn't see you straight to Coleman?
Because you, Coleman is right.
Where's Coleman?
Coleman is right here in O'keller.
Okay.
Yeah.
Cause I thought there was state or fed pens in Florida.
Yeah.
So it was like, why didn't you see,
cause Coleman has two pens.
They got two pens, a medium, a low and a girls count.
So it was like, why didn't you see the Coleman?
I was like, I don't know.
Why did something be way up here?
Like, man, this shit here is crazy.
So I've been there a couple of days
and kind of like adjust to it.
Start seeing multiple stabbings,
like different little things.
The dudes getting hit with locks
and it was just a whole nother world.
A whole nother world.
Are you in a cell by yourself?
Or you got a cellmate?
You have a cellmate.
Are you in like a whole pod full of cells?
Yeah.
You in a big, a big, like a, like a small Walmart.
Okay.
And it got cells at the top and the bottom,
around the whole top tier and at the bottom tier.
And the officer station is like to the right right here.
And they got one officer and they had to come in
with the key and pop the door.
So like at five o'clock in the morning,
you have to be up.
It's like a mandatory rule.
Wow, that's crazy.
So you're all the way up in Kentucky.
All the way in Kentucky.
Luckily there's some Florida people there.
Yeah.
I mean, we was only like,
I think we only had like 25 guys from Florida.
So we was like the smallest car there.
Yeah.
So it was like, look, man,
we getting into something everybody got to go
because everybody outnumbers us.
So you got to stick together and ride with them.
Stick together.
So Kentucky then, how long are you there for?
Are you there your whole, your whole time?
No, I was there for, I was there for three years.
Three years.
So I'm, I'm asking the counselor,
Hey, can I get back close to the Florida now?
You know what I mean?
I done been here so long.
I done programmed.
I don't want to get my GD.
I done did everything proper.
I done took some classes and all that.
And it was like, you have to be behind the wall.
You got a life sentence.
You have to be behind the wall.
We don't do pen to pen transfers.
Yeah.
So in order for you to go to the meeting,
you got to do 10 years.
So I'm like, man, you serious?
So you can't leave it before 10 years.
Yeah.
So I'm there.
And all of a sudden we get into it.
In my unit, we get into it with DC.
So it was like Florida car against the DC car.
What is the DC?
Washington DC.
Washington DC, OK.
So we get into it with them.
It's like a big riot.
We get into real big, real big brawls,
stabbings and all type of stuff.
And they shipped me to Coleman.
So back to Florida?
Yeah, finally getting to Florida.
So I was like, man, if I didn't knew this,
I would have been.
Bro, you would have been doing,
getting transferred out a long time ago.
Ben got transferred.
I was going to do that.
So I ended up getting to Florida.
Got to Coleman.
It was a whole lot better.
Because Coleman, it's like five or 600 guys from Florida.
Yeah.
So I got some guys that's from Tampa that I know.
So you probably know a couple of people.
Yeah, so it was a lot better.
Before you get to Tampa, are you like,
while you're locked up, are you still trying to pursue music?
Are you trying to pursue the splitter business
or do anything?
When I got locked up, I kind of like,
especially up there, I kind of like went straight
to working on my case.
So I was in there fighting.
You were trying to figure out how to get something reduced
or something.
Yeah, so I mandatory went in at the law library every day.
So you're going in there by yourself and reading,
trying to figure it out.
Yeah, trying to figure it out.
Getting help from maybe other inmates.
Other inmates.
And then one guy came from Tampa.
An inmate, or?
He helped me do.
He helped me get in and fight some stuff,
understand it better and all that.
That's in Kentucky still?
Yeah, in Kentucky.
OK.
Yeah, that's in Kentucky.
So mentally, I don't think it doesn't sound like you ever
really gave up.
It sounds like you kind of thought to yourself,
you're going to find a way out or die trying.
Yeah, I was going to die trying.
I wasn't going to die in prison.
So you thought there was some way
you could get him reduced or beat something?
Yeah, and my mentality kind of, you know,
I've been fighting all my life on the street.
So fighting, and now I've got to fight.
What a knife, so it's no different.
So I'm like, I'm not going to let nobody kill me in here.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
If I have to, I would rather hurt them
before they hurt me, you know what I mean?
So that's my mentality.
Because I'm going to keep fighting
to fight this sentence off, you know what I mean?
So I never gave up.
Are you working with a lawyer at that time, too?
Or no, just by yourself?
No lawyer.
No lawyer.
He immediately got off my case before right after sentencing.
Right, then he's gone.
Yeah, he was due.
You never talked to him again, or?
Never talked to him again.
Were you communicating with anybody outside?
Yeah, headbusters, headbusters.
Oh, yeah?
Headbusters.
This headbuster?
Yeah, this headbuster.
So who's he?
Who's he?
He's like, just like my bro, man.
Just like my other brother, man.
OK.
He was doing music with you before?
Yeah, he was the DJ.
So we kind of connected when everything was popping.
So we kind of like built a real strong bond.
Yeah, awesome.
That's what's up, man.
What about like your parents or brothers and sisters
that you had when you were younger?
My brother, he was there, too.
He was there as well.
My mom, she came faithfully to see me.
All the way in Kentucky?
Well, no, she didn't come to Kentucky.
She came to when I came to Coleman.
So it was like three years before I seen her again.
So three years, you don't see nobody, probably?
I don't see nobody, but my kids.
Your kids, they come to visit you?
Yeah, my kids.
How old are they at the time when you get in 06,
when you get arrested?
They was two and three years old.
Wow.
So that's going to be another tough element to deal with.
You're two and three, and you're going in for life.
Yeah, it was crazy.
But you're determined, you're going to fight it and get out
somehow.
Yeah, very determined.
Very determined.
That's interesting.
I saw this interesting video on YouTube, too, of Tom G with DJ
Smalls.
And it was like, I think, 2014 or 15, I looked on there.
And he was talking about you briefly.
And he was like, yeah, Tampa, he said,
Tampa Tony, he's a smart dude.
I think he's going to get out of this somehow.
Did you see that?
Yeah, somebody sent it to him.
Yeah, he was like, he just briefly mentioned what he said.
He's a smart dude.
I think somehow he'll make his way up out of it.
And then.
And that was before anyone actually ever before?
I think it was before you're pardoned.
Yeah, that was a couple years before.
Couple years before I even got the pardon.
So that was very interesting.
But I don't want to jump too far ahead.
So what?
You get transferred to Coleman.
And you're back in touch with a lot of people,
a lot of Florida people.
How many years you do there?
I leave Coleman in 2016.
You leave there in 2016?
Yeah.
OK.
So that was how many years?
So you did like 10 years there.
Wow.
Well, no, no, no, not 10.
I did three in Kentucky.
And I ended up doing seven in Coleman.
So you're like 10 years in at that point.
How are you staying up-to-date with stuff
going on in the outside world, like technology and music?
The music and technology help us.
Like, I'm asking them all kinds of questions.
Every time I call them, I'm like, man, well, who was hot?
Man, what's up with Tom G, man?
Yeah.
What's up with Lucky, man?
What did they guys got going on?
He's like, yo, man, he telling me everything,
lacing me up with the streets and how everything going on
with the music game and the new technology.
I'm like, what are they doing now?
You know what I mean?
Can you listen to music or watch videos?
You can listen to music.
You have to buy the music off.
They have an MP3 player.
They sell you music to load on the MP3.
But a lot of songs, it might be like six or seven months
old by the time we get them.
And what were you listening to?
Were you listening to a lot of music?
Or if so, what were you listening to?
I listened to a lot of old music, old classics.
I listened to some Drake, J. Cole.
I listened to a lot of that.
OK.
Trying to stay up on the current rap and see where it's at.
The whole time, are you still working on music?
Yeah, I mean, I'm writing.
Of all these years?
Yeah, I'm writing.
But the stuff I was writing, it was like,
that was my way of channeling all the hate and frustration
and all that.
So it was like, you know, somebody asked me that the other
day, it was like, did you do any writing?
And I was like, I did a lot of writing.
But I don't want to bring those songs out, you know what I mean?
Because I'm at a happy time in my life.
So I don't want to.
Right, no songs are from not a happy time.
No, not a happy time, you know what I mean?
Not a happy time.
And it's a different mentality, you know?
And that mentality and the penitentiary is like,
they don't like snitches, you know what I mean?
Like, if you're a snitch, they want to kill you, you know what
I mean, especially the child molesters,
like they call them chomos.
Like, if you're a chomo, they want to kill you, you know what
I mean?
So it's like, your mentality has changed and everything is like
ran off respect.
Like, if I can't cut in front of you, if you talking and I walk
up and start talking, that can end up getting you in the knife
fight.
Right.
Like, the simplest thing is putting my chair in front of the
TV in a small square spot and you come and move and turn it
slightly.
That can start.
That's it.
You can start just off that.
Wow.
Just something so simple.
And the currency is stamps.
Yeah.
Like the stamps they're going to envelope, that's the currency
in the prison system.
So that's how you buy things in there?
That's how you buy things in the prison system.
And in the same way, anything you want the same way out here,
they doing the same thing in there.
Drugs are getting sold in there, everything.
Everything.
Really?
Yeah.
So it's like another world.
What was like the most fucked up thing you saw?
I mean, obviously a guy getting stabbed in the neck and blood
squirting out, it's pretty crazy.
But what's like one of the most shocking things that you remember,
that like is seared in your mind?
One of the things that was very shocking to me was, like I still
remember, it was a guy, he was a white guy, he was from Tampa.
And I knew him.
He had like, I want to say like a month.
He had like a month left.
And they make shine, moonshine.
And shine.
So they was making, they was drinking shine.
And him and his partner got so drunk.
And I don't know what transpired.
And they got into this brawl.
Yeah.
So he ended up taking the knife out.
He knocked his partner down.
It's a guy from Tampa.
And he's stabbing him.
And he's like, he done snapped.
A guy he was just drinking with?
A guy he was just, he drank with all the time.
And he only like, and I'm like, so I'm calling him like, yo,
Cody, Cody.
You can see him.
I'm right here from him.
So I'm calling him because we hang out together.
You know what I mean?
So I'm like, hey, Cody, Cody.
And he snapped.
Like, I'm talking about to the point
where every time he come down with the knife,
he had a poker, like a lone poker.
Like a chisel, like.
Yeah.
Like an ice pick.
Like an ice pick, yeah.
So every time he come down, you can hear it hitting the concrete.
Like, oh!
Going through him.
Going through him.
And the blood is jumping.
It's all over him.
And he won't stop.
He just clicked.
And the guys like, grab me like, bro, don't, don't, don't do that.
You can't do nothing.
So I'm like.
Somebody's grabbing you from trying to stop.
Yeah.
Because they see me calling them.
And I'm inching forward and forth.
And they're telling me, don't do that.
And they're telling me, no, don't do it.
Leave them alone.
You can't do it.
You can't do that.
You can't do that.
And I'm like, yo, man, yo.
And I'm still yelling.
So they grab me and they take me in the room.
Yeah.
That's fucking wild, man.
Does that guy survive?
Yeah, the dude, the dude lived, though.
He did live.
He did live.
But he was, it was like.
What about the other guy that stabbed him?
You ever see him again?
Never seen him again.
But I think they say he ended up getting like an extra 10 years.
He only had two months to go, bro.
Two months to go.
And he does that.
Two months to go.
And that was like, that was like one thing.
How long was he in for?
I think he had been down like 15.
He had been down like 15 years.
Cody had been down like 15 years.
What do you think would make him somebody who
want to do that?
You don't think he wants to get out maybe?
Yeah, he wanted to get out.
Because some people like get accustomed maybe in there
and afraid to get down.
Shawshank Redemption, you know?
It wasn't that.
He just snapped.
He just snapped.
You know, you know, it's a lot of things going on
in the outside world.
And then you got a lot of built up anger
that you're trying to control.
And it was just that day for him.
And it's just the alcohol.
Like that lightening, that moonshine,
that's what they call it, lightening.
That moonshine, they get crazy off that shit, man.
And I mean, he would not stop, bro.
Damn.
Yeah.
What happens to the guy that got stabbed?
He survives, you said?
Yeah, he survived.
He survived.
But he was in intensive care for like months.
God damn.
Yeah, he was fucked up.
He was still fucked up when he came out
thinking he had a bag and everything.
Yeah, he was fucked up bad.
At what point did you start seeing the light at the end
of the tunnel?
How did that happen?
Like, did you hear something?
Because the short story, Obama pardoned you.
But how did that really happen?
Like, when did you start it?
Are you working towards that?
Yeah, well, the guy that came about when I was in Kentucky,
he was working on a prior.
I had like two priors that they used.
Two small men, like personal amounts of marijuana priors.
Yeah.
But in Florida, they're felonies.
So he was opening one of those cases up.
He got one of the cases open up.
And this is like, at the beginning of the bid,
you know what I mean, like 07, we started.
They didn't answer me and give me no play until like 2015.
And so what are you trying to do?
I'm trying to get this prior off.
So if they take the prior off, my enhancement
take me from life to 20.
OK, like your points go down or what?
No, it take a prior off.
So the prior is what they use to enhance you
to give you more time.
So if I get rid of this one prior, I only have one prior.
You can drop down to 20 years.
I could drop down from life to 20.
That's huge.
Yeah, so I'm all for it.
So I'm working on that.
And they finally grant that in 2016.
And that goes from 2007 to?
2007 to 2016.
I've been fighting this.
And they finally grant it.
And they take the prior off.
They vacate it.
So it take me from I put the motion in.
And it take me from with no lawyer.
And you do all this yourself?
I do all this myself.
And I go from life to 20 in 2016.
And then that's when I put the clemency in as well.
Because they give me a clemency lawyer, a clemency attorney.
So what is that for people who don't know what clemency is?
A clemency is when they come in and commute your sentence.
Like they take you at whatever sentence you at.
And they take the time from you.
So it's like they take you from the beginning.
It's like wherever you at right then on that sentence.
So you're 10 years in?
So I'm 10 years in.
On life.
Yeah, on life.
So they'll take you to where you can get right out.
So it'll take you from 10 years in from life.
And they'll put you at 12 years.
So I only have a couple of years to do.
So that's what they did to me.
So they give you a clemency lawyer?
Yeah, they grant me a clemency lawyer.
OK.
So you have to file for that?
Yeah, you have to file for it.
And they grant you one.
They grant me one.
And she was like, you got good grounds.
I think you're qualified for it.
Yeah.
Yeah, so we put it in.
And then I leave.
My stuff come in and I get the 20.
I go down from life to 20.
And once I go down from life to 20,
they transfer me from the penitentiary to the low.
I bypass the medium.
So when I go to the low, there's no stab
and there's no fighting.
Right, how different is that?
Let's talk about that.
It's totally different.
That shit is like nightingale.
Like summer camp compared to where you were at.
Yeah, it's like summer camp.
So I'm like, so I'm still like shell shell.
You're still in that zone.
I'm still in that zone.
Paranoid.
Yeah, paranoid.
Looking around.
But nothing's going on there.
So over there, you're in a cube with three people.
And it's an open bay versus being in a cell
with two people.
It's just you and another guy.
So it was like different.
Because I'm seeing people walking around.
And I'm like, why are you walking around?
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
They're like, I can walk around.
I'm going to the restroom.
I'm going to the restroom.
Right, before you couldn't go to the restroom when you want to?
Yeah, you can go to the restroom.
But it's in the cell.
Right, right.
Oh, so you're right there.
And you don't go out to the bathroom.
You don't go out to the restroom.
So now it's like they walking to the restroom.
And they're walking around.
And I'm like, what the fuck is going on?
You know what I mean?
Yeah, that shit was like crazy.
So you got guys over here snoring, guys over here snoring.
This guy here farting and this shit crazy, man.
So you hear all that.
So I'm like, man, I got to do something to get to sleep, man.
I can't sleep.
Yeah.
So when do they transfer you there after your clemency?
No, no, they transfer me that before.
Before.
Once I go down to 20 years.
Right.
I go from life to 20.
Right.
So once you get that first early charge gone.
When I get that early charge down to 20.
Then you're down to low security.
Yeah, so I'm down to low security.
And now you're fighting for the clemency.
Now I'm fighting for the clemency.
And I stay at the low for maybe like three or four
months and they transfer me to a camp.
You know what I mean?
So they sent me to a camp.
I go to Talladega, Alabama.
OK.
And I'm in Talladega in the first week that I get there.
They give me the clemency.
So I'm looking at like 20, 25 date before the clemency.
And then now they saying like 2018.
So I'm like.
So at first they tell you 2025, you're looking to get out.
Yeah.
And then one day they just come and say it's 2018.
Why do you think that?
Why does that happen?
Because of the clemency.
Yeah.
So when I get the clemency, I'm like, whoa.
So they like, your lawyer want to talk to you.
So I go and talk to you.
Like I got some good news.
So I'm like, what's up?
She was like, you got granted the clemency.
I was like, what?
She was like, yeah.
She was like, yeah, you can go back to rapping now.
Oh, yeah.
Did she say it?
Now, why did you get granted the clemency?
We did the paperwork.
She was like, your case was like unique.
They felt like you shouldn't have been in prison for life
your first time ever in prison.
Right.
You know what I mean?
You're charged.
It does seem odd.
You don't have no violence on your record.
No priors, and so that's crazy.
So it was like, yeah, you got it.
What did Obama specifically have to do with it?
He the one signed off on it.
OK, he signed off.
Because wasn't it you and also a bunch of other people?
Yeah, it's a bunch of other people
It was like 70 people, I read or something.
But I mean, in the prison system, that's probably not a lot of people.
That's not a lot of people.
So your chances are probably slow percentage, low percentage.
Wow.
I left a lot of guys in the penitentiary, like 40 years,
three life sentences, two life sentences,
then they'll never get out.
And are people in there, they're doing the same thing you're doing too?
They're filing all that.
They're trying to get that too.
They're filing everything.
They're trying to do everything.
And it's like they know that it's over.
This is what they'll die unless some amazing, amazingly happen.
Which happened to you?
Which happened to me.
Right.
So how do you feel when she tells you they grant the clemency?
I'm like, oh, man, it can happen again.
Like I can go back to the music, you know what I mean?
So now it's like, OK, now I just need to, I really got to study now.
So I call here, but I'm like, bro, listen, I'm coming home way earlier
than I thought, bro.
Yeah, he like, yeah, I said, yeah, man, I got to study.
Who, what's going on, man?
Tell me about this.
So I asked him, I'm like, what's up with Plyce?
Like, yeah, what is he doing?
You know Plyce?
Yeah.
OK.
Before you go in?
Yeah, before I go in.
I knew Plyce before he even got the deal.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
So I'm like, yo, man, what is what's going on, man?
What is what Plyce doing?
He was like, yo, bro, go because at the camp,
you're not allowed to have cell phones.
But it's so sweet and it's, you can get cell phones.
It's pretty lax.
Yeah, so they get, you buy the cell phone for like $100.
Yeah.
So now I'm trying to learn.
So I did get a little earliest head start on.
Yeah, so right.
So you're in prison for, or a pen, a federal pen.
For 10 years, technology moves fast.
In 10 years, especially the 10 you were in,
like the world's a lot different, right?
A whole lot different.
When you go in, it's probably like, no, iPhones back then?
Or no, flip phones and stuff, probably.
It was like sidekicks.
Blackberries, sidekicks and the chirp.
Yeah, the next tail chirp.
So you get a head start on the technology.
How crazy different is that for you?
Oh man, it's crazy.
Cause I'm asking him like, oh man, I need to get my MySpace.
He was like, MySpace, he was like, bro,
they don't do MySpace no more, man.
He's like, man, it's Facebook.
It's like Facebook and IG and Snapchat.
I'm like, what the hell is that?
Right, you never heard enough.
It's like, man, just go on, man.
Look, I'm gonna set you a page up, man.
I'm gonna give you the password so you can go in.
So he set it up and I go in and I look up,
I look up plies and see, I'm like,
so the guy's looking at me like, man, what are you doing?
You ain't on the phone talking to anybody?
I'm like, no, I need to learn this shit, man.
Trying to figure out what's going on.
Yeah, I need to learn.
I'm trying to figure out how plies not dropping music,
but he's still.
He's vibing at the Ritz Carlton.
Right.
Like he's real fire hot.
Right, cause social media is completely different.
It's totally different.
It's everything now, but back then it's,
my space was, I mean.
My space was just it, that was it.
It was different.
Yeah.
Now it's everything.
It's everything.
So that's what I learned from you.
YouTube, Instagram.
YouTube, Instagram, so that's what I learned from that.
I sat there and like studied that shit over and over
and over again.
Yeah.
Watching his videos, looking at the numbers.
So I'm asking questions like,
hey, what's all these numbers?
Like, they say like 300,000.
He was like, yo, those are all the views they got.
I'm like, 300,000.
He's like, yeah, click to the top and you'll see
how many followers you got.
I'm like, he got four million followers.
Yeah.
I'm like, you got, you mean four million people?
Like following him?
Like what?
He was like, yeah, bro.
So I'm like, looking at all the videos,
300,000, 300,000 million.
So I'm like, whoa.
I'm like, yo man, this shit is the new technology.
This shit is the new wave, man.
Yeah, that's it.
For sure.
It's everything nowadays.
That's wild.
And was it like, is it like they say it,
like when you first got out or you really didn't get out
because, or am I skipping over too much stuff?
Cause when you went to the halfway house,
you were in Alabama right first.
Yeah.
And then when did you go to the halfway house?
Well, I went, I went from Alabama.
How long are you out of Alabama?
I was out of Alabama for maybe like three months.
And that's a camp?
It's a prison camp.
It's a prison camp.
Okay.
Where you go to work or what?
Yeah, what they make you go work there.
You know what I mean?
So it's real, it's super laid back.
Ain't nothing going on there.
It's not even an argument going on there.
Yeah.
So I go from there and one of the officers
kind of like messing with me because of the clemency.
Like he doesn't like it or what?
Yeah, like he don't like it.
You know what I mean?
So he started like bothering with me, bothering with me.
So he's going through my cell and all that.
So I'm like, yo, bro, what are you doing?
Like, oh, you think you came from the pen
and this and that and like you tough and all this.
And I'm like, yo, I'm not on nothing, man.
I'm laid back, man.
I'm at the camp.
This is the boys club, man.
Right.
You know, it came a long way.
Yeah, I came a long way, bro.
I ain't on nothing.
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna get you sent away from here.
And that's what he did.
He got you sent from there?
He got me sent from there.
Is that, that's good or bad?
No, that ain't good.
Right.
So why does, how does he get you sent away?
He tell him that I, I threatened him.
You know what I mean?
Like I was being aggressive with him and all that.
So I was like, yo, man, why are you lying?
He was like.
Just cause he didn't like you.
Just cause he didn't like me for no reason.
No apparent reason.
Right, right, right.
Through that door to the right.
Yeah, for no apparent reason, yeah.
So he get me sent away from there.
I leave there and go to Yazoo, Mississippi.
Mississippi.
So where, that's another camp or?
No, that's a low.
That's a low.
Okay.
Yeah, that's a low.
So I ended up going to Yazoo, Mississippi.
I mean, Yazoo's except for like a year.
And they got like, when I get there, they got like,
they got more phones than the people out here
on the outside room.
Yeah, really?
So it was different there compared to Florida.
Yeah, it was way different.
They were ahead.
They was ahead.
So I got a chance to, you know, talk to a couple guys
and they really like.
Get caught up on technology.
Yeah, they showed me everything about it.
A lot of young guys was there.
So they was like, yo man, you gotta be IG.
You gotta go on IG.
Yeah.
So I'm actually, I'm like, yo, what's, what's the,
like, can I wear my Yvizos and red monkeys?
It was like, fuck no, man.
Nobody heard of them then.
They're like, man, bro.
The hell is that?
They're like, bro, you better not never say red monkey
and Yvizos again.
You can't go out there with that shit.
So I was like, what about LRG?

He's like, it's true religion, man.
Yeah.
Robin jeans.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
I'm like, man, what the hell?
Bro, you never even heard of those probably right?
I never heard of none of that, man.
So yeah, it was keeping me up on the fashion
and telling me all that.
So I was like, okay.
Yeah, it was crazy.
Wow.
And then how did you get from there back to Florida?
Once I left there, it was my time
for my halfway half date.
How long were you there for?
I was there about almost a year.
In Mississippi.
In Mississippi.
So then you're creeping up on 2018, right?
Yeah, so it's time for me to go to come
to the Tampa Halfway House.
And so how long, you have to be there
for a certain amount of time.
Yeah, I had like six months to do that.
You have to be there for six months.
And where that's Tampa?
Yeah, it's in Tampa.
It's a Goodwill in Tampa.
So I end up there, yeah.
And you live there?
Yeah, I was living there,
but I'm going away from that.
That was Tuesday was my last day.
Tuesday was your last day?
Wow.
Two days ago.
Literally two days ago.
Literally two days ago.
How does that feel?
Oh man, it was a blessing.
I was loving that.
I was so happy to get away from that shit.
They, it was crazy there.
At the Halfway House?
Yeah.
So real quick, what's that like a little bit?
Yeah, I don't even know what a Halfway House really is.
So they put you there to do what?
To kind of get a job, right?
And get a custom back into the world.
Yeah, I'm trying to get you to transition
back into the world, but it's like, it's no help.
Like.
They just tell you to go get a job.
They just tell you to go get a job.
They just tell you go and go.
And you got to be home by a certain time.
Yeah, you got to be back here by a certain time.
Oh, okay.
Look, we're going to let you go and open a bank account.
You know, a lot of guys was drug dealer,
so they ain't never open a bank account, right?
No, so they're like, man, what you mean a bank account?
Right.
You know, this guy's been there like 20,
been down 20 years, 22 years, 25 years,
never had a bank account.
When they went in, the beepers was like scarce.
It was like, they was just coming up.
You know, people was just getting popular.
Right.
So it's like you bringing them the smartphone.
They don't even know how to cut the smartphone on.
Yeah.
You know, the certain rain when,
when somebody trying to call you a video,
you from Messenger.
FaceTime, yeah.
Yeah, FaceTime.
They looking at the phone.
They putting the phone like, yo, man, what is that, man?
What do I keep doing?
Over here, yeah.
They're like, man, somebody trying to video you, man.
He was like, man, I don't want to see nobody, man.
What are you doing?
I just want to talk to him.
Yeah.
Right.
FaceTime isn't even around back then.
No.
That's like, I mean, that was barely cameras
on your phones back then.
Yeah.
So it's like, that's crazy different.
And they don't teach you none of that.
They don't like, okay, well look,
we're going to have a class for smartphones.
No.
So we can like walk you through it.
So you'll learn something about the smartphone.
They don't do none of that.
So you got to live there for six months
and just find a job.
And you got to be there for six months
and without what, getting in trouble, obviously.
Like getting in trouble, you got to pay them like 25%
of your earnings.
Of your pay.
Of your gross.
They want it before you.
No way.
The taxes come out.
Yeah.
That's fucked.
They want it for the taxes.
That's crazy, right?
They're going to get their money somehow.
Yeah.
Always.
Always.
And the halfway house, is it anything like a jail
or is it you have like a house with a bed in it?
It's like a building and it had rooms with like.
Like apartments?
Yeah, it was just rooms.
It's like little smaller rooms.
And it had like the single beds.
It got like four, eight single beds in there to sleep.
Eight people got lockers in there.
More like a little, I don't know if I could college on, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, like little small little things.
Okay.
It's like a little compound.
Yeah.
I mean, but they let you go get a job.
You got to go out work.
You got to go out and work.
You got to be back by a certain time.
You eat there, right?
Yeah, you eat there and all that, yeah.
So, and how many people were there with you?
I think it was like 65.
65 people.
65 people.
It had girls there too as well.
Yeah.
And females there too.
So it was like a co-ed halfway house.
But it was like crazy.
Like they was treating like they was officers.
Yeah, they think they're making bad.
The terminology changed, you know,
once you leave prison, when you go to the halfway house,
you're not an inmate no more, you're a resident.
Right.
And the staff is not COs, they're just staff.
You know what I mean?
Right.
But they want to treat you like prisoners.
They're trying to treat you like you're in prison.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
So I'm like, man, come on, man.
They got no idea what you just been through.
Yeah, I'm like, bro, so I, you know what I mean.
They just work at the Salvation Army.
Yeah, you just work at it.
You are an employee for the Salvation Army.
You don't work for the federal government at all.
Right.
You can be replaced in any time.
You know what I mean?
Like you can make one mistake and you replace.
So are they looking to like write you up on something
to send you back or?
Yeah, like they sent me back.
They sent you back.
So you're there for how long?
So they didn't send me back to the prison.
They sent me back to the county.
They sent me to the county jail.
So they sent you to the county jail.
Yeah, and I went to Pinellas for like.
Oh, 49th Street.
Yeah.
I was at Pinellas.
I don't even know about Pinellas, huh?
Yeah.
This cat's been there.
I've been there.
I was there for like,
I wonder what, like six weeks.
How long are you into the halfway house?
I was at the halfway house for six months.
Six months, and then they send you back
to 49th Street at the very end.
No, at the beginning.
Oh, at the beginning, okay.
I think I'll, I have my job for like a week.
Yeah.
And it was saying I was moving around.
On 420.
On 420.
Okay.
They sent me to prison, I mean to the county jail on 420
and we dropped the no feelings record.
On 420?
Oh, shit.
So while you're in the halfway house,
that's going on.
Yeah.
So we got the date set up.
Eight man, 420.
We're going to drop the no feeling.
And all of a sudden at 420, I get locked up.
And they just send you back.
You don't know you're going back?
No, I don't know I'm going back.
They just tell you're going back.
They didn't send, no.
They don't tell me nothing.
The marshals just come.
Come and got you.
Yeah.
Come and come back.
We're at that place?
Yeah, at the halfway house.
Yeah.
Wow, man.
Yeah.
So I sit in a county for like six weeks.
Supposed to have been there like three weeks,
but they came to pick up some other people
and intentionally left my paper.
So they was like, oh, we'll come back here.
Because you're a big case, honestly.
You're a big case, especially when it comes to little
Pinellas County and stuff.
They get up on a high horse and they don't want to help you.
Do you know favors for sure?
No, and the halfway house was the same way.
You know, it's like, they know who I was.
So they was like, you're not getting
no special treatment.
I'm not trying to do nothing but music.
Like, I don't want to do nothing but music.
I'm not going back into the streets.
But they really like on me like, hey, you got to get a job.
You got to do this.
You got to do that.
No, you can't be on IG.
You can't be on this.
So I'm like, man, it ain't no rules on that.
You need to have that in the rule book.
Oh, you do it and you going back to the county.
So it's like, OK, do I buy body rules, which is not a rule.
You just making it up because you
got to have it in writing.
Or I just say, fuck it.
So I said, fuck it.
I went the IG crazy.
And then they sent you back to county?
No, that was when I got out.
Yeah, that was after I got out.
So what, they send you back to county
for a couple of six weeks, you say?
Yeah, for the last two weeks.
And then what, they put you in a different halfway house?
No, no, they put me back in the same place.
Same one.
Put me back in the same one.
The same people.
With the same people.
So they like, yeah, you see, you went the job like so.
I was like, I'm still going to get out to September 25.
It's no different if I do it here.
You know what I mean?
What'd you do on Tuesday?
Tuesday was, we had an interview at Wilde.
At Wilde 1941.
So that was the day you got released.
You're free on Tuesday.
And you already had a schedule full of interviews and stuff.
So you were free at 12 o'clock AM that day?
No, at 6 o'clock that morning.
6 in the morning.
They let me, they released me.
From the halfway house?
From the halfway house.
And what, they just opened the door and say, you're free?
Or what?
They signed a little paperwork and they were like, you're free.
That's it.
And then what?
So you got your people to come pick you up?
Yeah, here, busted my brother.
Busted, picked him up?
Yeah.
OK.
And we head over to the radio station.
We're going to get breakfast.
Yeah, where do you go?
Where'd you go for breakfast?
Where we went to?
Denny's.
Denny's, all right.
Oh, fuck.
I would have hit Waffle House, but Denny's is good too.
That's why I haven't been there.
That's why I need to go to Waffle House.
Oh, man, bro, Waffle House never been.
They're on the come up.
Yeah, Waffle House.
I like Waffle House.
That was my jam back in the days, man.
Waffle House.
I fucked with Waffle House, heavy.
Yeah.
A lot of people, it seems like, I mean, at least
in like the recent past, like in the recent history,
what I've noticed is like when Gucci got released from prison,
he was super weird.
You could tell something was off with him.
Everyone started calling him a clone.
He was acting different.
His wife would always be videoing him on Instagram Live,
posting videos of him everywhere.
And you could tell the dude was just out of it.
Like he didn't really, he wasn't himself.
He didn't seem confident.
And can you relate to any of that?
Like, I don't know if you were able to see that.
Yeah, I've seen it.
Yeah, it's got to be a quick transition.
But I think with Gucci, man, what it was,
it was when everybody seen him before, he was high.
Yeah, he was high all the time.
He was high all the time.
Like he was like high out of his mind.
So everything was the substance that was like
making him act out and be, you know,
so after a while of being high so much every day,
all day to going cold turkey and not doing anything.
So you like...
You're a different person?
You're a different person.
For sure.
And even physically he was a different person too.
You're a different person.
So that's different for people.
Yeah, so that's why I look like he just...
That's why it seems so much different
because he's always high.
He was always high.
Real quick, to go back,
are you dabbling in doing any drugs back then?
When you're selling?
Are you, you know what I mean?
Are you getting high?
I'm smoking weed.
I'm smoking weed, yeah.
Cocaine and stuff, I don't know.
So that wasn't, you just smoke a little weed,
but everything else was for sale.
Don't get high on your own supply.
Yeah, just weed.
Because a lot of them people, you know,
they're selling drugs, but they're getting high
and all that stuff.
Yeah, yeah, I knew a lot of them that was like that.
This dude had a patent on some shit, man.
He was doing it for real.
Yeah, you were on it for sure.
The splitter, so that was my thing, the weed, man.
It was the splitter.
That's how the splitter come apart, man.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
So do you got any inventions coming up?
Well, I'm gonna bring the splitter back up.
Bring it back?
Yeah, I'm gonna bring it back up.
Cigarellos, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm gonna bring it back with the Cigarellos.
You still got the patent for it?
Yeah, I still got the patent for it, yeah.
Okay.
Just really back into the music, man.
What do you like listening to right now?
Right now, I haven't really been listening to music
because I really don't wanna be influenced
by a lot of the stuff that's out right now.
Okay.
You know what I mean?
So it's just certain things that really grab my attention
that I listen to, but outside of that, I won't.
Okay.
You know, just really what the radio playing,
you know, certain things like that, but...
You're focused more on the output.
Yeah, I'm focused more on the output.
How about your music too?
It's pretty different from the music back
before you went in.
Yeah.
You know, music back then was on a whole different trend
that it was kinda like a bounce trick daddy style.
Yeah.
You know, now the music's a little different.
How do you adapt to that?
Well, it's like do it and put my own twist to it.
Yeah.
It's like with the no feelings record,
everybody was expecting me to come out with a juke record.
Right.
Like, man, I know you're coming out with a juke record.
What's your first record?
Right, that's probably what everybody's expecting.
Yeah, so I'm like, no.
And this is different than that style.
So it's kinda like on a style that's being played now,
but it's like with my flavor to it.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, I feel like it's very up to date.
You know, the juke style, that stuff was back then.
Yeah, yeah.
And that was the hot shit back then,
but it's definitely a big transition now.
I feel like you're completely,
I feel like you're caught up already
with the no feelings song.
Yeah, that's what I wanted to do.
When I heard the track, I was like, yeah,
this is where we need to go.
Like, you know, everybody like, man,
you gotta come back with a juke record, a club, bang up, man.
Yeah, yeah, because that was the songs back then.
Yeah, but I'm like, no, I don't wanna do that.
Like, I can give you that,
but I'm not gonna give you that right now.
I'm gonna get on what's going on right now
so it can fit in, you know what I mean?
Right.
Yeah.
Right now you're just going super hard in the studio.
Super hard.
We already just came straight from the studio, right?
Straight from the studio, yeah.
Damn.
And then you got an EP coming out?

So even in the no feeling song,
you're kind of like singing a little bit almost,
you know, with the harmony and the hook, that's you, right?
No, no, that's J-Von.
Okay, that's somebody else.
I was gonna say the hook and the verse.
I thought maybe that was so different.
Yeah, nah, nah, that's J-Von.
J-Von, he produced the record.
So you're just rapping the verses?

I'm excited, you know what I mean?
Right, it's all new to you.
Yeah, because it's like, okay,
I don't have to get a bunch of flyers,
I don't have to print up a thousand or 2,000 CDs.

How was the response in everything so far?
The response is great, man.
I mean, you've only been out two days, but...
The response is crazy,
especially after, like a lot of people didn't know I was out.
They heard things, you know, so they was like,
so by me going on a while and in the morning show
and the way social media is set up to see the visual,
they was like, he is out.
Yeah, because I couldn't figure it out for a while either,
to be honest with you, I was following you on live,
because I heard you got the pardon, but you're working,
but I'm reading online, you're still in,
so I find out you're in the halfway house and stuff.
Yeah.
So I couldn't believe it.
Like, you know, when I'm working,
I'm out certain stores or something like that,
somebody seems like...
What were you doing for a job?
