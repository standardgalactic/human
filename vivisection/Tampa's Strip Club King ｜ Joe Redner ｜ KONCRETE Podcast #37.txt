All right, we're live on podcast again with Joe Redner.
Thanks again for coming out here, man.
Thanks for having me.
I've been wanting to do this interview for a long time.
You are, so how did you become such a legend
and an icon in the Tampa Bay area?
You've been, you're very well known around here
and you're very outspoken and people call you an activist.
But how initially did you become so well known in this area?
Well, about 1976, I went to work for a gentleman
that had a go-go bar and I went in as a night shift manager
and that's where the dancers wore pasties and G-strings
and that's what they wore.
They didn't strip, they didn't do anything.
They came out and danced a couple songs and then quit.
So anyway, I saw a case from a Supreme Court
of the United States that said nudity in speech
was protected by the First Amendment.
Nudity in speech?
In speech, yeah.
In other words, if you're dancing and you have nudity,
that's protected by the First Amendment.
Because you're speaking, you're saying something.
Okay.
Conduct, how you conduct yourself,
how you dress, all that is speech.
Okay.
You're saying something to other people.
So then I opened a club that was a nude and had alcohol
and it was a beer joint and I called it, it was a Dorio's
and no, I called it the night gallery.
The chain was Dorio's before it was a beer joint
and I called it night gallery
and we started the girls dancing nude
and the city started raiding me
and there was hundreds of raids
and eventually people go into jail and get bonding out
and I bonded them out and finally we got an injunction
that says you can't do that against the city.
Saying their nude ordinances were unconstitutional.
So then they left me alone for a while
and started using their Luton-Lissivius Statutes against me.
Well, Luton-Lissivius, you have a right to a jury trial
so we had to have those.
It just went on and on.
I could just go on and on and on
but essentially it's just the government overreaching
and invading people's constitutional rights
because of something they read in the Bible
and that they cannot justify inter-court law
with evidence, things like, well, a lot of things.
Now, did you know that you were the first person
to have a nude strip club in Tampa?
Were you aware of that when you did it?
Yeah, I was very much aware of it.
And you didn't think that, I mean,
did you anticipate any kind of blowback?
Yeah, but you know, if the Constitution says
in the Supreme Court says I could do something
and I believe it's my fundamental right,
even if it doesn't, if I think it's a human right
and a fundamental right, if I feel a necessity to do it,
I'm gonna do it and then I'll defend myself, you know?
Right.
With my peers and that's what I've been doing.
I've been defending myself in the press
and that's how everybody told me shut up, shut up, shut up.
No, I'm not shutting up, you're coming after me,
I'm gonna go after you any legal way I can.
And the legal way is to get to the press
because the press is coming to me and saying,
hey, this is what they're doing to you.
What do you got to say about it?
Right. Okay?
Let me say what I got to say about it.
Right.
And when was all this happening?
When was all this taking place?
Oh, this was happening from 76 to 87
or something like that, just constant.
It was constant.
The only respite I had is when a female mayor came in.
Every male mayor came after me.
That's really right.
But not the female.
No, they didn't have a problem.
That's hilarious.
Why do you think that is?
Jane Cast, I mean, Sandy Freeman, she didn't buy.
Because I think that women in order to get elected
have to be really smart.
Right.
And she needed the law.
But men don't.
Yeah.
And we have a lot of people in office
that they're not really smart.
I mean, I'm not saying they don't get things done
and people don't like them.
But I'm telling you, they're not really smart.
Right.
They don't know all the ins and outs of them.
No.
They're this a male personality.
Yeah.
That's crazy.
And so all the Tampa mayors who were men really were
breathing hard down your neck, trying to,
what exactly were they trying to do to shut you down?
Well, you got arrested like a ton of times, right?
Yeah, I've been arrested 150 times.
Oh my.
Yeah, I've spent a lot of time in jail for contempt to court
because I wouldn't obey a judge.
And really one of them I even got his sympathy
when I was in jail when he realized what was going on.
And he let me out early.
And they were trying to implement a rule where
the girl had to be six feet away when she was giving you
a lap dance, right?
Yeah, had to be.
No, had to be.
Just think about what you just said.
Let's just wear a virtual reality goggles.
You might as well.
How do you get a lap dance at six foot away?
Exactly.
So there is no lap dance, right?
There wouldn't be a lap dance.
That was the point.
That was why they did that, right?
Absolutely.
Well, they want to shut these clubs down,
but they can only go so far.
Well, when they think you step over the line a little bit,
they're going to come after you because they want to shut
you down anyway.
It's a Republican way of doing things.
Make the problem, then point at it
in order to get rid of the thing that was operating the way
it should in the first place.
They create the problem.
And then they point out and say, this thing don't work.
Right.
So that's what they did.
They tried to use a bunch of excuses
saying that all your girls were on drugs.
They called them crack whores.
They used all kinds of crazy language
to try to make you look bad.
Yeah, well, I went to their schools.
There was more drugs in schools than there is in the Mons
Venus.
And I proved it.
So when exactly did Mons Venus, when was that created?
When did you actually start that brand or that company?
1982.
That was 82, OK.
And I was reading a book that had the mound of Venus in it,
Mons Venus.
That's what they called it.
And actually, it doesn't translate perfectly
to the Mons Venus, mound of Venus.
But that's what it means to me.
OK, so I like that.
Mons is a mountain, I guess.
It's the pubic area.
OK.
That little mound down there.
The little mound, yeah.
Now, all those places in the country, out of all the strip
clubs in this whole country, I mean,
I've been to strip clubs in Miami, Las Vegas, New York,
Atlanta, there's something about that little hole in the wall
on Dale Mayberry that attracts like.
Don't you call my club all the time.
It is.
It's small.
It's like, it's really small.
It's a small building.
And when you see it for the first time,
you're like, this is what everyone's talking about
from the outside, you know what I mean?
And there's something about that place that's consistently
drawn the most beautiful women in the world.
And it's not like any other strip club I've ever been to.
Is there like a secret to the way you do business that
makes the.
I'm the dancer's center.
I'm centered.
I'm everything is geared toward the dancer.
The dancer comes in when she wants to.
She leaves when she wants to.
The dancer can work seven days a week, can work one day,
can work as many hours, can work the shift she wants to.
She can switch shifts without telling anybody.
Yeah.
They can go to school.
They don't have to work their job around their school.
I mean, their their school around their job,
they can they can work their job around their school.
The school can be what they want to really want to do.
Everything is for the dancer.
So I get the best dancers because that's a reputation.
Yeah.
And then pay wise, weren't you paying them different?
Or I don't pay the dancers.
They take all their money, right?
Yeah, but they keep all their money.
They keep all their money.
They perform a service.
They give a lap dance.
They perform a service.
They get paid for it.
Right.
I don't tell them how much to pay for it.
I have a recommendation from 25 to $35.
It's posted, but I don't tell them how much to charge.
And I don't take their money.
Which is a lot different from the other clubs.
Other clubs, they take the cut.
Yeah, they take the percentage of the cut.
Really?
OK.
What kind of money does a dancer in your club make?
Depends.
What's like the what's like the skit?
Satisfied working two or three hours and making 200 the day.
And then you have the ones that want to come in and work 10,
12 hours, which is not many, and make $800, $900 a day.
It depends on the day.
So I say a dancer can make a good dancer that's not really
can make a couple thousand a week.
Wow.
Yeah.
She wants to do 40 hours a week, five days a week.
Ain't no talent.
So when was it when watching all those videos on YouTube
or those preachers standing out in front of Mons Venus
screaming at you through the megaphone?
Oh, screaming at everybody.
Jesus Christ is going to come back,
and you're going to go to hell for bringing
all these drug-addicted women here and dancing.
Why does it always seem that the nastiest people in the world
are religious?
Right, always.
Why is that?
Well, I think they gravitate towards religion
because they need saving.
In other words, they have this antisocial part of themselves.
They know it.
If they do, it's like putting your finger hand on a burner.
You get burned.
If they do it, they get in trouble.
So they turn to religion because they
think that's going to stop them from doing
these antisocial things.
So when anybody is a born-again Christian,
I'm not talking about comfort Christians.
When somebody is a born-again Christian,
I'm worried about them.
I'm worried about myself with them
because they just told me they have some kind of bad problem
that they're trying to stop.
Now, the comfort Christians that believe in a God
because they're going to see their families,
they don't believe in a literal interpretation of the Bible,
they pick and choose.
Because they're going to see their family,
their children may be died before them,
it makes them comfortable in life and death.
That's good.
Those are comfort Christians.
They don't do what these born-again Christians do.
They're not trying to push their ideas on everybody else.
Exactly.
What were you doing on those talk shows
where you were talking to a preacher and you and the preacher
were debating and arguing about stuff?
You remember that?
Bill Keller.
Bill Keller.
It was called like bleeping something.
The bleeping truth.
Oh, that was another one.
Yeah, so you were talking to the street preacher
and basically he was just yelling at you about God
and you need to let God into your soul
and he wanted to save your soul and all this stuff.
It was just like this huge battle.
It just seemed like religion was against you
and everything that you were doing.
And it seemed like that was kind of like a long battle.
Well, maybe it's because I'm against religion.
I think that religion's one of the worst ideas
that's ever happened.
Although I don't think man had any choice
in having this idea because he didn't know
what the hell was going on and was trying to figure it out.
So anyway, it's done more harm to society
than any single idea that's ever been brought forward.
Communism, all that stuff that's been these bad ideas.
Well, it's not bad if you keep it to your...
I mean, once you start to bring it into politics,
that's when there's big time problems.
It allows itself to do that.
That's why it's bad.
Right.
You recently, you were diagnosed with what?
Stage four lung cancer and prostate cancer.
Is that right?
I've had both of you.
And you're now in remission.
Well, they call it remission.
I call it cure.
You call it cure. You're cured.
Wow, that's amazing.
Congratulations.
How long have you been cured?
I got it late 81, so they cured me in a year.
So I've been cured for seven years.
Seven years.
That's amazing.
Only 4% of the people live five years
after being diagnosed with stage four lung cancer.
And I'm, what, eight years now.
Wow.
So how long did they tell you?
What did they tell you?
Marijuana had a big part in that.
I can testify to marijuana.
Right.
It had a big part in my getting well.
How so?
Well, it allows you, the chemo, it's killing you.
Chemo is something that treats you so bad
that you think about not doing it and dying.
Yeah.
That's how bad it is.
So it just kills every, it just nukes everything
in your body.
It's trying to, it's trying to kill, it's killing you.
They just hope it kills the cancer before it kills you.
Because that's what chemo doing.
It's killing you.
It's barbaric.
It really is like a barbaric way to cure disease.
But I let the doctors do their thing
and then I did my thing, which is my health thing.
I'm a raw vegan.
And I fought it my way with no sugar.
I was amazed at the Moffit when I was getting the chemo.
If you just sit there four hours
and you're putting that, pumping that stuff in to you.
And they were bringing the ice cream.
And I'd say, what are you, people crazy?
All right, so you were already vegan then
or that prompted you to be?
Sugar feeds cancer.
Oh yeah, right.
It feeds it.
Yeah, and they're bringing you sugar.
And they're bringing you ice cream to comfort you.
And I said, no man, I don't need that.
Yeah, it's really good.
We just fire up the joint here and I'll be fine.
Yeah.
Well, I couldn't, I had lung cancer so.
Oh yeah, you can't smoke it.
Yeah, it makes sense.
That was doing all edibles at that time.
Okay, that was like the weed and the edibles.
Was that, when you were done with chemo,
that just like made you more comfortable
and took away all the symptoms of the chemo.
Right.
And it helps you eat, give you an appetite.
Helps your appetite, yeah, it does all those things.
And you know, you have cannabinoids in your body.
If you don't do cannabinoids,
your cannabinoid is deficient.
So it's just eating it.
Or putting it in your food, a fresh marijuana is really,
it's really good for you.
Hela, now did you consume marijuana prior to this?
Or was this like the first time that you started
actively consuming it?
I told you earlier, I don't obey laws that I think are unjust.
Okay, I got you.
So, no, I didn't marijuana before, but I smoked it.
I didn't do edibles or anything.
Right, yeah, you just smoked it.
I just smoked it.
I never had a problem with it.
Never, ever, ever had a problem that would justify
any time in jail, any time in,
so I thought there was really none
of the government's business.
Yeah.
Because I didn't have any effects.
I couldn't overdose, all those things that other drugs
give you problems, they give you, marijuana does not.
Now, why do you think Florida's so far behind
when it comes to Republican legislators?
He didn't even have to think about it.
Republican legislators.
Why are they holding it back?
Why are they holding Florida back
when it comes to legalizing marijuana?
Because the special interest, watch the marijuana,
this is not just marijuana, this is everything,
but the marijuana thing.
Do we have a ruling for Flora Grown that says that we can,
that we have a right to-
Flora Grown is your company.
Company, right.
We sued and got an injunction and then we sued
and then that was upheld in the appellate court
that says their statute that regulates marijuana
and the way you get a license is unconstitutional
because they have given their,
the licenses to their friends, it's crony capitalism.
Just a few companies in violation
of the constitutional amendment,
just a few companies have been given licenses.
They are unregulated and no one else can get a license
and that's anti-American, that's un-American.
Free enterprise is the basis for our capitalistic system.
They have taken that away.
I have a right as a citizen of this country
to a license just like everybody else does.
You do too, you have a right to fair competition
to go in there and compete against the other ones
if they're limited in numbers of the license,
to compete against them and have your chance.
Like every other American does and they just,
the Republicans, they give you all that lip service
and then they do just the opposite.
They gave the licenses to their buddies.
And their buddies are the ones who own these companies
that are growing marijuana.
Oh, I'm talking about the money.
We were talking about the money.
And then what they do is the legislators,
actually they do it in other ways,
but they call for contributions
if the companies want something done.
By saying key words and stuff like that.
And now the companies that have the licenses
give them a bunch of money, the legislators,
so that's why you have the problems here in Florida.
Now, they buy the legislators.
They buy them.
It's out in front.
They're brazen.
I don't understand why anybody lets them do it.
And these companies, they're just growing.
Not just marijuana, the energy companies,
all these companies that have Xs,
they have monopolies on everything.
Opiates.
No, they go into an area
and they're the only one that services that area,
the electric companies.
You have different electric companies,
but there's no competition in this one area.
Those, that's crony capitalism.
I have a right just like everybody else.
That's America.
That's equal opportunity.
And that's what I fight for.
What do you think about the opiates versus marijuana?
Like, what is the current state of that?
Because I know there's,
I know there's in the path,
there's been a lot of pushback for,
for, you know, there's been a lot of problems
with the statistics of people dying from opiate overdoses
and like the methadone clinics in Florida
and everyone that dies from all that compared to marijuana.
And I heard that there's a guy named Mel Sembler
who is, he owns like some methadone clinics
or I don't know the exact details,
but basically he was pushing back really hard
against legalizing weed because he made money
from opiates.
Sembler, yeah, I've been aware of Sembler for a long time.
He's a bundler.
He gets, he bundles money for the Republican party.
He's been for president and in the state.
He's a big influencer.
He had an organization one time,
I think that treated kids for, for drug problems.
And they were cited for abuse, abusing children.
Their methods were so draconian that it was abuse.
Right, he basically made money from people overdosing.
He's terrible.
He's a terrible, terrible man.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, he has no empathy at all.
And if it's not in his interest, forget it.
So he's a big part of that being held back from.
Yeah, he is.
He's Ray Rodriguez who is in the house up there
and who spearheaded this fight
against our constitutional right to marijuana.
They're fighting against those Republicans.
They say they're for the constitution, but they're not.
They just get lip service to it like everything else.
And so Ray Rodriguez, he's the guy
and Mel Sembler and Ray Rodriguez are, fuck buddies.
Who is Ray Rodriguez again?
He's in the house, the Florida house.
Oh, is he?
Okay.
Now, when did you become so actively involved in politics?
Like you ran for Senate, right?
No, yeah, I ran for Senate.
I've run for city council a few times.
I've run for county commissioner a couple of times.
Yeah, I've run nine times.
So when did you start?
When did you make the decision?
The house one time, the Senate one time.
So when did you start?
When did you decide I need to be involved
in Florida state politics?
And obviously you thought there needed
to be some changes made, right?
It's a platform.
It's a platform to get out and speak
when they're not listening.
You have something you want to say.
I just felt like I was being attacked.
Not personally, my belief system,
my American belief, the way I believe America is
and the freedoms and all that,
I feel like it's being attacked.
And I want to fight it.
I'll give you an example when they went after the gays.
I said, I was gay.
I'm not gay.
I saw that interview, yeah.
But I wasn't afraid to say
because I knew that I could help protect the gays.
I went first, I went and tried to give my money
to an organization, gay organization
so they could hire a lawyer to fight that thing.
They went and got a lawyer.
The lawyer said they didn't have a case
so I filed my own damn case.
And that's how I said I was gay.
Wow.
Anyway, and we win the case.
They had to put, can't be used in first amendment settings
on the law so that kind of negated it
because parades are, almost everything is first
and has a first amendment component to it.
So.
Now, so going back when you were fighting for the,
when you did that fight for the gay rights in Tampa,
it was because they had banned the parades in Tampa?
Is that why?
Actually, they had banned some booths at the library.
Talking about first amendment.
Yeah, there was, they allowed displays.
They allowed students at South Florida.
It's a yearly thing to put up displays in there
with what they wanna communicate to the community.
And they had a gay, one guy had a display
with gay authors, not even gay about gayness.
Right.
With gay authors.
Right.
So these are gay authors.
And Rhonda Storms, who was on the county commission,
she took umbrage with that.
She didn't want them to do that.
She said it was glorifying gays and she passed the policy
where the city, the county could not help any gay thing.
I mean, just gay pride is the word they use.
They were not gonna facilitate it
or have anything to do with it.
And they used that to take these displays out of the library.
And I just, I've read on Nazi Germany and it just hit me.
This is what they did to the Jews.
It's the first fucking step.
Someone's gotta do something.
And that's what I thought, and that's what I did.
And I wrote a complaint, said I was gay.
We settled the complaint.
I didn't win the complaint.
I did win, but we settled it
where they added some verbiage to the policy,
the county commission policy.
It wouldn't allow it to be a use
for first amendment protected activity,
which those displays were.
Jesus Christ, Joe.
That's fucking crazy.
So how many cases have you won over your time?
You have to instigate me for me to remember.
I've lost some and I've won some.
But I've won a bunch.
It sounds like it.
I've won a bunch.
I know what I'm doing.
Right, seems like it.
I mean, they threw me into the law.
I spent 10 years in the law library studying.
Smoking a joint before I went and went when I...
I wish that a joint was fire up right now.
Rafal, cue the joint.
You got one for us?
It allows you to...
What was I talking about?
You got me off my butt.
You got a hot spot.
I was talking about smoking weed, sorry.
Oh, the cases you've won.
Oh, the law library.
Okay.
Yeah, concentrate.
When I'm smoking, it's like, if I want to be,
it's like I can be hypnotized
and really concentrate on something.
And I would go down, drive around the block,
smoke another joint, go back up the law library,
and sit in there.
I'd sit there eight, 10 hours a day,
sometimes seven days a week.
What the fuck?
Learning, the biggest deal with the law
is learning to research.
If you're going cold turkey
and you don't know how to research, brother, that's hard.
That is hard.
And if it wasn't for some nice, gay law library,
they kind of liked me and he helped me.
He never hit on me, but he was, Bill Wells.
And he helped me.
And he said I had more respect for those books
than the lawyers and the judges
that came in that law library.
And I did.
And I do.
Yeah, I really liked your commercials,
your campaign commercials.
I thought they were hilarious.
Yeah, Jeff and Adam did that.
Those were so freaking good.
That's awesome.
I love how your slogan was that you're not for sale.
Yeah.
I think that's strong.
Well, it didn't work.
Why don't you think it worked?
Well, let's say I'm an adult club owner
and I'm an atheist and I advertise both of them.
So, yeah.
So they're probably really scared of you.
What does that mean?
They call me the devil.
What is the actual definition of an atheist?
To me, it's someone that doesn't believe
in the concept of a God, of a supreme being.
Okay.
I know a lot of definitions get loosely thrown around,
so that's one.
Yeah, I'm atheist.
I don't believe in it that there's a supreme being.
I just, if there was a being that was supervising this,
he certainly wouldn't be supreme.
He's not supervising.
Yeah, he don't know what the hell he's doing, does he?
Do you believe in aliens?
I believe it's a possibility.
Do you see the thing about the raid on Area 51,
how everyone's gonna go raid and try to find the aliens?
Let's see them damn aliens.
Yeah.
Don't you think Trump would already told us that?
I don't know.
Hell yeah.
You think he would've?
Oh, he can't keep his mouth shut about it.
What do you think about Donald Trump?
Maybe for enough money, though.
What do you think about him in general?
I think he's got every bad habit that males have.
Yeah.
Every single one.
He doesn't hide them very well either.
He doesn't even try.
He doesn't even try, right?
And I kind of feel like the people that follow him
have every one of those bad habits, too.
Yeah, they cover it up good.
It's like the stove.
You put your hand onto the Burjee.
You learn not to put your hand on it.
So you don't hear from these people, but they're there.
And now he's embolling them.
And they're going out and killing people.
And they're killing America.
They're going out and he's embolling them.
And they're going out and getting their guns
and going out and killing Americans.
And the thing about it is,
they're not all brown Americans.
And that's who they're after.
And they just kill indiscriminately.
And this is Trump.
This is Trump's world.
This is Trump's America.
I don't like it.
I don't want to be here.
I don't want to be in this,
but I'm not going to leave.
I'm going to try and change it.
People say, if you don't like it, leave it.
That's what they say.
Right.
I'm going to try and change it.
Yeah.
What do you think about any of the current 2020 candidates
that anybody you like in particular?
I'm a Bernie guy.
You're a Bernie guy?
Yeah, Bernie's saying the same thing.
Now, 35 years, he's been saying the same thing.
He hasn't changed a bit.
They're coming over to him.
Eventually, that's the way it's going to be.
The way Bernie says it.
You think it'll get there?
It's either going to get there or get nowhere.
Yeah.
One or the other.
Why Bernie, though?
I mean, forgive me, because I'm like a five-year-old when
it comes to knowledge of politics.
I don't really know much about it.
I just kind of skim the surface.
I don't believe that for some reason.
You know, I try.
I'm trying to get smarter.
That's why I do this podcast, is because I
get to have people like you on here,
and I get to download all this info,
and it makes me a little bit smarter every time.
That's good thinking.
So from what I understand, Bernie
is the one that wants the closest to socialism, right?
Democratic socialism.
Democratic socialism.
It's where the government controls
the means of production.
Bernie does not want the government to control
the means of production.
He likes capitalism.
He likes controls on capitalism.
And that's what we like, too.
Because if you don't have controls on capitalism,
people will be made slaves of.
That's just the way it is.
And the socialism is the control.
And people don't understand that.
Socialism, socialism, no, it's not.
Democratic socialism.
Democratic socialism.
It's control on the means of production.
Police departments are socialists.
Any time the people get together to do something,
that's socialism.
OK.
It's just what it is.
In other words, we get together to build a road.
That's socialism.
We get together to have a police and fire department.
That's socialism.
Those are not capitalism.
OK.
The OSHA is socialism.
So OSHA says you've got to treat your workers a certain way
that you can't put them in dangerous positions
and things like that.
That socialism.
OK.
What do you think about gun control?
Like the shooting that happened in El Paso was yesterday,
I think, or two days ago?
So what's the best possible?
What is your feeling on gun control?
What's the best possible world about guns?
What's the best possible what?
World.
World?
Yeah.
No guns.
That would be the best possible world.
I don't know.
I don't know the answer.
So you think all guns take them away?
No.
I said that's the best possible world.
If they just did not exist.
That's not reality, though.
Yeah, that's not reality.
So what do we do?
We work to try and make it that way.
In other words, keep the guns out of hands
and people that are known, people that are dangerous people
and have gun control checks so that you
can tell if that's what they are,
maybe loosen up the criteria for taking a gun away
from crazy people who have been threatening,
loosen up a little bit of controls there.
I think that the amendment was worded the way it is,
a well-regulated militia.
I believe that guns are, what a question.
Yeah, sorry.
It's a constitutional right.
And it's just so hard.
But I do know this.
In countries where they've outlawed automatic weapons
and those assault-style weapons, they
have much less killings and maybe even none, almost none.
And we have them happening every single day, mass shootings
with those magazines.
There's a sensible gun regulation.
How about we don't let them have those goddamn magazines
that shoot 150.
Man-killing shells that there's no reason
for in the world for having.
You can have people have guns.
I was listening to an interview last night with Ted Nugent.
And he was pointing out how all the mass shootings take place
in, or statistically, a huge percent of the mass shootings
take place in gun-free zones, like Connecticut, for example.
And you think that's true?
Would you believe anything, Ted Nugent?
No, I would not.
I would not.
But I didn't actually look up the research.
I know there are places where they have a gun-free zone,
but they just go across the border and pick up their guns.
And they can do that legally.
So what good is the gun-free zone,
when the people from the gun-free zone that do the killings
can just go to boxes and pick up a goddamn?
Exactly.
So that's a joke.
That's a non-statistic.
It has no meaning.
He's against weed, too, I think.
Yeah, he's against weed.
Now, he's a good guitar player.
So where are you?
I don't know.
I can't even testify for that.
What a talent, huh?
So that guy can think because he can play a guitar.
Right.
What else was I going to say?
So I wanted to ask you, you sued the state of Florida?
Twice.
Twice.
One time for your company?
One time for the company to be able to get a license,
to enter into the marijuana business,
like the other companies that do it,
and one, to be able to grow my own at home.
So I can drink your smoothies that you're juicing.
Well, juice it, eat it, whatever way.
See, the amendment says, oh, you got it right with you.
Oh, yeah.
Medical use, which I'm with your immune for,
this amendment gives you immunity.
Medical use means the, now listen to this.
This is amazing.
And then they're going to tell me I can't grow.
It means the acquisition, possession, use, delivery,
transfer, or administration.
That means how you give it to yourself of marijuana.
OK, that's what I can do with the marijuana, right?
Right.
All right.
Here's what the definition in the amendment of cannabis
is, that I can do all those things with.
Right.
Any part of the, of any plant of the genus cannabis,
whether growing or not, the seeds thereof,
the resin extracted from any part of the plant,
and every compound, manufacture salt, derivative mixture,
or preparation of the plant, or its seeds, or resin.
That's what I'm allowed to possess.
Right.
That's what I'm allowed to transfer.
That's what I'm allowed to use.
So where's the argument?
That's the Constitution.
That is, this, there's nothing higher at law than this.
It trumps every other thing there is.
Statute, policy, whatever it is.
If it doesn't go by this, it's unconstitutional.
Therefore, it's invalid, and they're violating your rights.
Simple as that.
And then so that's the argument you take there, right?
Yeah.
And you win?
Well, no, this is on my homegrown.
No, I won in the lower court.
The appellate court reversed.
Now I took that one to the Supreme Court of Florida.
This one, the homegrown one?
Yeah, the homegrown is now in the Supreme Court.
Wow.
And they're going to say whether they'll
accept jurisdiction or not, which I think they probably will.
So why has it taken so long?
The state.
Why, I mean, what's the state's?
Assembler.
Ray Rodriguez.
What are their?
The Republicans in the legislature.
So what is their argument against you?
Well, they have to make, what is the argument?
They say it doesn't say what it says.
That you cannot, well, what are they saying?
They say it doesn't say what it says.
What is their actual argument?
The actual argument is there's a part of the amendment
that describes what an MMTC, which is a medical marijuana
treatment center, can do.
OK.
OK.
And the medical marijuana treatment center, let me get this,
means in the amendment, it means an entity that
acquires, cultivates, possesses processes,
including development of related products such as food,
textures, aerosols, oils, or ointments, transfers, transport,
cells, distributes, dispenses, or administers marijuana
products containing marijuana related supplies
or educational materials to qualifying patients.
That's what an MMTC can do.
OK.
That's not about medical marijuana patients.
That's about MMT businesses that go into the business.
It's separate.
They say, you'll love this argument,
they say because the word cultivated in there,
and they can make grow your own marijuana,
that it's the same as cultivating,
that that cultivating somehow takes my right
to possess a plant growing or not away from me.
Right.
So there's some very vague language in there,
and they're trying to say that.
Well, it's not even vague.
It just tells the amendment.
T.C. is what they can do.
It's very explicit.
Doesn't say a damn thing about a patient.
Right, right, right.
So I have my rights in one part of the amendment,
and the MMTCs have their rights in another part
of the amendment.
One has nothing to do with the other.
They both can exist by themselves without the other
and operate.
They do not conflict with each other.
How are they nullified my rights with the right of an MMTC?
That's the whole question.
That is the question.
That's the big question.
Now, what do you think is going to happen with the Supreme
Court?
Well, if they go by the Constitution,
I have a resounding win.
If they do what you're reporting.
Because your Supreme Court of Florida now,
it had three, four Republicans.
One of the Republicans went with the three Democrats,
progressives that were, or not progressives,
but more liberal justices that were there.
Those three now have retired.
They have appointed three more conservative Republican judges.
So now we have seven Supreme Court justices
that are all in the pocket of the legislature.
So it is such a flagrant, I think we may win,
because it is such a flagrant violation of every principle
that you interpret the Constitution with,
that I don't think they can get around it.
I think there would be a lot of public outcry if they
don't do it the right way.
And what do you think it would mean for you to win this?
For you to win this case and for the Supreme Court
to rule in your favor?
What do you think that means for people like yourself
in Florida and for patients, for cannabis patients,
or people that just want to grow their own weed?
Well, it means that people that can't afford it.
Because that's why I'm suing.
I know those people out there that are hurting.
I hear them from them every day.
They can't afford their medicine.
They can't afford to even go to the doctor
to get the damn card.
And then they can't afford to get the card.
And all they would have to do is grow some marijuana at home
and get their medicine.
And it is medicine.
It's not to get high.
It's medicine.
Get all that crap out of your heads.
It is medicine.
It's better than opioids.
It's better than all that stuff.
It does more for you.
It cannot kill you.
It can disturb your cranium for about an hour or two sometimes
if you take a little bit too much.
But that all can be dealt with for the benefits
that you get from it.
And you don't have to be that way anyway.
And when I eat the marijuana, it doesn't get you high.
It's not activated.
Really?
Yeah.
I've eaten some edibles that have sent me to farms.
No, no, no, no.
That's activated.
OK.
That marijuana is decarboxylated.
It's been heated up already to make it active.
OK, that makes sense.
OK.
Marijuana, in its stage, coming from the fresh flower?
The bud?
The bud?
Yeah.
The flower?
Yeah.
Will it not get you high?
Really?
They just eat it.
Yeah, that's why you smoke marijuana.
OK.
Because the heat activates it.
That's what gets you high.
Right.
That makes sense.
OK, so you're taking a very active stance,
and it seems like you're doing this for everybody else.
It's my right.
It's my right, and I have an interest in it.
So it was my right to have that new dancing.
I had an interest in it, so I did it.
I had property rights fights with the city of Tampa,
which I won.
They were my rights, and it was in my interest to fight,
so I fought, and I won.
You still own Mons Venus?
Yes, I do.
OK.
Do you own any other clubs as well?
No, I don't.
I don't really have the interest in adult clubs
like I used to.
Right.
That was when I wanted to open another one,
and then another one, and here I was fighting people.
All the time.
Right, it gets tiring.
Yeah, it does.
It really does, and so they stuck me in jail.
So 150 times you were arrested.
That's insane.
Well, you know, here's what I did.
I first started.
I'd go down to the jail, and I'd say, what are you doing?
Jail, blah, blah, blah, and I'm sitting in there
with the jailers, and I'm saying, look,
these guys got to be in here five days a week.
They're going to be in here five days a week
for almost the rest of their life every day, eight hours a day.
They got to be here.
Here I am in here.
I'll be gone in four hours.
No, that's not so bad.
Right.
So I just worked it out in my mind.
Yeah, yeah, look at the bright side.
When I went in for contempt, I went to school
or did something like that.
I've been in jail like three times for contempt of court
one time for five months.
Damn, that's just a memory.
That's a long time.
What does that mean, contempt of court?
Well, the court has ordered you to do something you didn't do.
They ordered me to close a business.
I wouldn't close.
Right, right, OK.
And then they put out an order to arrest me
and started looking for me, and I was running all over town.
It was funny.
Wow.
Yeah.
So are you doing anything else besides,
are you doing any other big business ventures?
Do you own any, do you buy in real estate or anything?
Continuously buy real estate.
What kind of real estate do you buy?
Business.
You just buy, you're buying businesses?
Commercial, yeah.
OK.
No, not businesses, commercial property.
Warehouses and stuff like that.
Warehouses.
Yeah.
OK.
Yeah, one of the warehouses I bought now is the IRS's office.
So I'm their landlord.
You bought the IRS?
No, I didn't buy it.
They came to me and wanted to put it in there.
Really?
My building, yeah.
Where is this building in Tampa?
Yeah, it's right on the Dale Maverick and Boy Scout Road.
Wow.
Now, do you actively buy and sell?
Or do you just sit and hold them for a while, just collect?
Do you just collect the income?
No, I don't sell any.
So you're not flipping stuff?
No.
And we have a brewery that's opening up in, very shortly,
probably in Wesley Chapel.
Really?
A Strotton brewery.
OK.
Florida Avenue Brewing.
I don't know if it's my new brewery.
Oh, we'll have to come check that out.
Florida Avenue Brewery.
OK.
Florida Avenue, yeah.
Is this your first brewery?
No, Cigar City was my son and I's first brewery.
It was all him except for my money.
Right, OK.
Now, Cigar City is probably one of the most,
except for Budweiser, one of the most well-known breweries.
Oh, yeah, definitely.
Highly, you guys made Highly and a bunch of other brands,
right?
Yeah.
Highly was what made it famous, really.
Now, all this investing, all these businesses that you're buying.
Actually, we out at the Denver, they
had the beer, whatever you call it, the beer things every year.
They give out awards and all that.
You enter beer and they give out awards.
And we outbeat for awards for gold medals and all the medals
we beat Cigar City this year.
So we're ahead of them.
Really?
We're the number 10 brewery in the country.
Wow.
For small breweries.
That's open now?
Yeah, the Florida Avenue Brewing is here in Tampa.
And then we're going to expand into Wesley Chapel.
Bought a nice piece of property up there.
Going to have a nice restaurant.
Brewed a lot of beer.
Oh, yeah.
Now, all this stuff started from just money
that you've made from Mons Venus.
And you just kind of started investing in other stuff
and diversifying?
Yeah, it all came from Mons Venus.
That was a start.
That's incredible.
Then we just sold Cigar City.
Not too long ago.
Made a lot of money there.
Yeah, that's nice.
So things work out.
Cool.
On to the next fight.
So when is the next date for the Supreme Court,
for that case or anything?
Well, we filed our motion for hearing.
And they have 15 days in order to answer that.
So nothing happens for 15 days.
And they'll probably ask for an extension
at the last minute, which tolls it.
The state, they just get in the way of everything.
In other words, they stall, stall, stall, stall, stall.
They don't want to go anywhere fast.
They'll try and break you.
Going to court is not cheap.
No, that's what they're trying to do.
You've got to be rich, very, very rich to do this.
Or be a big corporation.
Right.
Yeah, that's not cheap.
These lawyers don't do not come cheap, believe me.
You've got to have deep pockets to fight those people.
I'm over a million in these two lawsuits.
And just these two?
Yeah.
Wow.
What keeps the drive to keep fighting these fights?
They're attacked.
I have a right to do it.
They're attacking me by telling me I can't.
So I got to fight.
You do.
Roll over and die.
I think a lot of people probably would.
A lot of people definitely would.
Yeah, but they're not.
They don't have.
I was.
I didn't develop this or anything.
I was born with whatever I am.
I was born with in order to do anything else.
I'd have to mess myself up as far as I'm concerned.
Right, right.
So.
Yeah, you just have a higher purpose.
You have that burning, burning fire.
Somebody's got to do it.
Gets my interest.
Right.
It satisfies me.
It makes me feel like I have some worth.
Yeah, so.
People like you are needed.
I mean, if you don't fight the fight,
then who's going to, right?
I don't know.
Hopefully there's another guy, but I don't know where they are.
Yeah, you got to.
I have to.
I have no choice.
Well, we thank you for that.
Yeah, you're so welcome.
You're an inspiration to us and many others.
Thank you.
Awesome.
Well, thanks again for your time, Joe.
You're so welcome.
All right, Joe.
Talk to you again soon.
Really nice.
