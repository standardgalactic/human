Hello world. The following is a conversation between Sean Atwood and Matthew Steeples who
discuss what will happen to Ghislaine Maxwell during and after her current trial. I've had
Sean on this show many times. He's the notorious ecstasy kingpin who was exiled from the United
States and became a true crime author and podcaster. Sean has a very deep and comprehensive
understanding of the current Ghislaine Maxwell trial as he's been following, studying and
making videos about Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell for years. Please enjoy this conversation
with Sean Atwood and Matthew Steeples.
Currently I'm very focused on Miss Maxwell. I think you know that is the key thing for me.
Recently this book came out by my friend Kirby Summers. This is the book that I recommend you
all read. This is a book that actually delves into the truth of this story. I think it is far
better than anything else out there. She's going to be writing another book and you can buy her
book on her website and I think by Amazon and I would suggest it's well worth reading. It's a
book that goes into parts of this story where other people don't dare and she is very good at
researching it. She quotes a friend of mine Alexis Parr in the beginning and Alexis works for a
national newspaper and she says it is a wonderful highly original and wonderful sprint through the
glamorous global big business and high society. I think this book is the book that actually
explains the truth of the fact that this is a story about Ghislaine Maxwell rather than Jeffrey Epstein.
So you're constantly looking at all new sources of information on the Maxwell case to see if you
can glean anything perhaps that you are not already aware of. Did you glean anything from this book?
The book was very good because she delved into Ghislaine's past prior to her involvement with
Jeffrey Epstein and what was her motivations and her connections with other people who were of
high society who met mysterious ends including some Greek people that she was involved with.
No a Greek family and they were all linked to a certain bunch of people who in London met
mysterious ends and I think that's something we'll talk about another time when we can go through it
more properly. So the trial date is getting closer and closer what are we less than two months away
now? The trial is beginning allegedly on the 29th of November but I believe that could possibly be
delayed because she has tried to argue or her lawyers have tried to argue that it will be
unfair to the jury because they will miss Thanksgiving and Christmas and that will be
a problem and it probably will be moved into the new year but we don't know none of us know what
will happen next. For the moment the date is the 29th of November but you know the date has already
been moved once so it's possible it could be moved again. She doesn't stand a chance
at trial I believe. Do you think her lawyers are monetizing her arrogance to line their own
pockets? I think that Miss Maxwell is the most arrogant woman you could possibly imagine. She
barricaded herself in the prison conference room recently with a trolley. Her behavior is that of
an arrogant person she's angry she doesn't have enough computers she's got two she's angry she
doesn't have access to enough paperwork this is a lady who is not going to cave in easily.
She if she had a brain she wouldn't be in the position she was in for a start she would have
left the country and she'd have gone to France and she would have behaved like Roman Polanski
and she could have avoided being detained instead she bought a house called Tucked Away instead she
used a fake name to buy a house. She has done everything in her power she gets she complains
constantly she annoys Judge Nathan every day with stupid letters from her stupid lawyer who I think
is actually a poor quality lawyer because she's not doing her a service the woman is doing her a
disservice representing her in this way um I would if I were her I would try and do some kind of deal
but she hasn't tried that yet and we're still waiting to see that and as we get closer and closer
all she does is put more content on her website she uses the people who are helping her who I
won't name because I don't think they deserve the publicity to harass people who have tried to say
things that she doesn't like her brothers are you know I don't blame them wouldn't you protect your
sister and that's one thing he said Kevin and and and he he is right in that regard of course I
if it were my sister I would behave in a similar fashion to him but it doesn't mean it's the right
thing to do what kind of threats and cyberbullying and attacks have you come under from covering
the Maxwell case I receive a number of threatening messages I've had threats of lawsuits I've had
threats that are more personal um I'm kind of used to this from having been involved in the
vicar at St David's case I know what level of threat is very dangerous and what isn't and most
of them are cranks but um you never know what maximum sentence is Maxwell facing if she loses on
all counts at trial and what will her fate be after she is sentenced to such a big hefty amount
um she would be facing between 45 and 60 years I would say from what I've gathered from what I've
read elsewhere um so she would die in prison there is no there is no way out once she is in prison
if that happens she will be there for the rest of her life and it will not be a pleasant experience
for her and she is not doing anything to minimize that from what I see yet she she's been totally
uncooperative to date so she hasn't done herself any favors so people are going to be just you
know absolutely wondering what happens to her next when she's sentenced and from my experience
I was in Arizona State so people with crimes of that nature would get sent to a sex offender's yard
whereby they would not get attacked by the general population now we recently interviewed one of
the Nat West 3 one of the Enron 3 Giles Derby who got sent to a mafia prison in the federal
system Maxwell is going to be in the federal system so he's at this prison where there was
predominantly a lot of mafia characters but there was also pedophiles so it seems that there are some
federal prisons that have mixed populations do you think that she will be classified as such a
high profile case that she would have to go to a special prison for sex offenders because
Giles said that the sex offenders in his prison they're given a story by the guards you know I
wasn't they're going to say that they weren't doing such and such they were doing bank fraud for
example that's their cover story do you think because she's so high profile they will have to
classify her to a yard where she's going to be other people with similar crimes to reduce the
likelihood of her getting killed by the inmates I think it would be absolutely impossible in the
world of social media and the amount of press coverage she has had that anybody would be able
to pretend she wasn't who she is it's absolutely impossible to hide her identity because she is
who she is and the acreage of coverage has been so vast so far and it will get more and more and
more that she's not safe anywhere so they will have to create some way of keeping her safe you
know in the same way in England I suppose you know you have Rose West and you have Myra Hindley and
people like that had to be dealt with in a different way you know the the Bolger case you
know those two boys that committed that terrible crime you know you have to treat people like that
in a different way because they will be attacked and whatever she's done you know I don't think
someone should be able to kill her you know I think that would be a terrible thing or you know abuse
her as was said this morning in this talk she was allegedly abused by her own father but that
doesn't make it right what she's done to other people but it doesn't make it right that other
people should then be able to abuse her again in prison so I believe that if she does receive the
double digits that Matthew proposes the maximum sentence she will be fast tracked a suicide watch
immediately because she will be in shock right now she's clinging on to the hope of getting out
that desperation is being monetized by her lawyers who are just going to max every motion out as
we've seen I've lost count of the bail bond appeals now which are completely futile over
than the money we're talking we're talking five five attempts at bail and all sorts of other
things that she's technicality she's tried nothing works because the problem is that she's
proven to be a liar like her father you know in in in this book one of the quotes is I have a
beautiful daughter and she's just like me and that is what sums her up she has the same arrogance
as Robert Maxwell she's so arrogant she thinks that this will all still go away she still thinks
that Prince Andrew could come riding in on Shergarda racehorse you know and save her from
everything it is a completely ludicrous state of affairs her friends have mostly deserted her
there are friends out there who I speak to a lady we both know she continues to say you know
Gillain is somebody who just got into the wrong crowd and it wasn't her fault and she didn't do
anything wrong and poor her but she did she was there it's proven the flight records prove it
she tried to say that that GM wasn't her on the flight records on one flight it was GM and Kevin
Maxwell now the the chances of it being someone called George is pretty low um she she continues
to lie she claimed to be a citizen of Teramar when interrogated by the FBI this is a woman who lives
in fantasy land she is completely crackpot she's mad and she's been indulged in her entire life
and now it's finally caught up with her and it is time that she and Prince Andrew and all the others
answered some questions and behaved themselves and took responsibility in society we have rights
we also have responsibility and she committed crimes I believe now the jury will decide whether
she committed those crimes and the level of those crimes but frankly it is time she answered
to justice so if she does go to trial and there's still quite a good chance that there'll be a
last-minute plea bargain or if she does go to trial and which she will lose because the public
opinion is just insane on this she does have a wild card obviously which I'm going to ask Matthew
about next well let's just say the normal course of events she gets sentenced to decades in prison
there's a period of adjustment of the brain whereby she's going to go through a period of shock
where she will be on suicide watch in a suicide watch part of the prison the prison will be pretty
burr stripped out you know nowhere she can hang herself and every so many hours guards will come
and check on her she'll have a major psychiatric evaluation they may put on some kind of medication
to stabilize the shock that she's in during that period of time because it's that period of time when
if she is going to self harm or go all the way a prison is most at risk after receiving a life
sentence and the federal bureau of prisons knows that so they will try and handle her accordingly
once she is determined by the psychiatric professionals that she's no longer at risk of
suicide then she will be reclassified to a different prison she will be classified I believe to a
prison that houses people of like crimes a security status will probably be very high in the beginning
she will have to prove herself over time to move down in security status so the likelihood
is that she's going to be locked down for a considerable period of time whether they give
her a cellmate or whether she's got neighbors I mean the costs of maintaining a whole floor for
this woman are astronomical so she will end up on a run of prisoners these prisoners may not be
allowed out of their cells because the security level is so high but there is a chance that after
suicide watch she will have a cellmate they may just let go from suicide watch to single cell
first to see how she behaves but at some point she's going to have to adjust to living with a
cellmate so as she comes out of this shock phase and just starts to think you know I've got to make
the most of this situation I've got to get through each day I'm going to launch my appeal now I'm
going to cling on to the hope of this appeal getting me out as she that that will be the next
swing of her brain because right now all of these lawyers that are milking her dry have pumped her
up with this idea that she can win at trial which is preposterous while they're making millions off
the back of that notion but the next thing that they will do they will come at her and they'll
start to visit her in the prison through the legal visitation room and they'll be telling her
the appeal now we've got to work on the appeal this is how they can line their pockets again but
also if the wild card comes into play this is a way that she could get out so what often happens
in these very high profile cases that are PR dynamite for prosecutors they want to get a
headline making sentence everyone goes home from that sentencing hearing you know watch
the headline news that she got the maximum aggravated sentence this woman is convicted of
the most heinous crimes in society she's got what she deserves all the public are satisfied by that
and the you know the need for blood is satiated but two or three years down the road when this is
no longer the biggest reported true crime story in the media when you kick the right amount of
back sheesh to a appeals court judge she could slip through the cracks and the way that road is
greased is through her connections to the current administration so we know about the
relationship with the clintons we know the clintons have got many people embedded in the
present administration we know going way back to the boys on tracks and you know the CIA
operation through Arkansas the drug trafficking that the clintons have got massive ties to
intelligence and though you know those relationships rolling forward to the present day could be
utilized to get us some kind of backdoor exit down the road so satisfy the public for now
but let her out early so many years down the road when there's not so much interested the case
thoughts let's look back at some of the cases I've previously written a lot about Max Clifford
Rolf Harris people like that the public wanted a certain result they wanted those people locked
up and Rolf you know Max Clifford didn't ever get out so you know you can't compare that but
Rolf Harris you know he's out and they all try the appeal route the first thing she is going to do
if she loses will be to appeal appealing is the natural course of action of her lawyers if she
loses they'll want to make some more money and they'll lead her further up the garden path and
they'll hope that they get a better judge because it's all about who you get
and at the moment she's got a judge that she's annoyed she really has annoyed this current
judge you know her behavior has been annoying she she keeps going after this bail she barricades
herself in the cell she moans about her conditions all she does is send stupid letters well her lawyer
sent stupid letters um that calls irritation and frankly I don't think her choice of behavior
is going to help her in this first instance but even if she were to lose she would continue down
the same path because she's got this arrogance about her I've seen it from other members of that
family and you can see it from the way the father behaved now the father the father was a megalomaniac
and he molded her to be like him and she has had every connection in the world she's lived in
in utter luxury people call this a gilded cage but you know she had complete freedom she didn't
have to do anything bad nobody ever forced her to do anything bad her brothers were able to reinvent
themselves without committing crimes of this nature in the wake of their father's crime you
know that they lived in mansions in Oxfordshire that that didn't seem to come to an end everyone
says poor you know poor her she lived in poverty she never she never lived in poverty she still
got powerful friends there was still money floating around she didn't have to go into the
world of being involved with a taxi driver who suddenly became a man who lived in an 80 million
dollar house and nobody forced her into this and everybody who says we must have sympathy for her
is completely wrong you know the last time I encountered her I didn't know I was in the same
place she was at a car rally for victim women that were sexually trafficked this woman has no
sense of what is right and wrong and equally the lady that ran that charity called cash and rocket
I've written to her on multiple occasions and asked why she was involved with her given she
knew that she must have known that this lady had been involved with Jeffrey Epstein you know what
is wrong with all these people at the end of the day we all have to make choices in life and there
is the right thing to do and there's a wrong thing to do and this lady will will continue to go down
the route of being crazy she will not ever take responsibility for what she did and that is why
she'll immediately launch into an appeal if she loses so if the case does go to trial and the
Clinton name does not is not mentioned would that be an indication that some
behind the scenes deal has been struck the mention of the Clintons I don't believe will occur because
she knows she knows who to upset and who not to upset I think she will mention other people
I've been sent various lists of people she will mention I think they'll probably be the people
we don't expect they will probably be actors and minor politicians rather than the most powerful
people why do you think Donald Trump said I wish her well
so let's just have a look at the you know we're trying to analyze every scenario
of what could happen at trial here so there is the possibility of her being found innocent
there is indeed I give that point zero zero I would say that's less than one percent if she was
found innocent what what what would that indicate to you that the fix was in beforehand if she was
found innocent all hell would break loose because there has been so much about this and there have
been so many people dragged into this and there are so many people who have been able to prove
things that are completely true and things that she has said already that are complete lies you
know she's lied about so many things including you know the flights and there are many other
people who've lied like for example mr president Clinton who claimed he'd only been on the plane
four times but he'd been on over 20 it would be a truly I don't want to use the word no it would be
very it would be a disaster for many people it really would because this has ruined a lot of
lives and these victims are not prepared to shut up and the photograph I think is the key thing
the photograph of Prince Andrew which he has continually tried to discredit and to his
shame has said I've never met this woman I know I've spoken with lots of people who are elderly
and they are very big supporters of the monarchy and they they say without what every single one
has said to me this this man should be ashamed of himself for embarrassing his mother by pretending
he never met this woman it is a very disrespectful thing to do he could he could he could do the
right thing and say I met this lady but nothing happened that would be the correct way for him
to behave equally with her she could say I was brought into this and I didn't really know what
was going on whatever her excuse could be but instead she pretends nothing ever happened
that Jeffrey did nothing wrong she did nothing wrong nobody did anything wrong well some of
the people who've made allegations could be telling lies but equally there's a lot of evidence to
suggest that a lot of it is true and it is time she took some responsibility
what about Prince Andrew taking responsibility we've seen this indictment or whatever legal papers
he was served with was it are they asking him yeah could you explain what has he been served with
Prince Andrew has been served with legal papers that relate to a civil case it is not a criminal
case and if he settles the case it does not mean he did anything it's absolutely a matter of payment
for civil damages the the alleged victim Virginia Roberts she has already been paid by both
Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell they have both reached civil settlements by doing so they did
not admit that they did anything to her the public may take their own view but they made a payment
instead Prince Andrew has tried to avoid even being served with the papers he has now accepted
those papers after a game of cat and mouse in which he's hidden away trying to hide behind
his mother's coattails at Balmoral and again bringing you know unnecessary attention to his poor
mother who is a grieving widow and he hasn't even bothered to go and see his own grandchild
he thinks that avoiding it is the way forward he is not helping himself through his actions
okay so there is yet another possibility it's not just a case of guilty and not guilty a third
outcome is a mistrial and from speaking to I think it was Giles Derby recently he was telling us
about federal court system mistrials if you have a mistrial then you have to have another trial it
just all starts with scratch which is an absolute windfall for the lawyers and in cases where people
don't have much money it is a strategy that will wipe you out financially because you cannot you
know you may have all this money for your first trial pay a high price lawyer hundreds of thousands
and you're wiped out millions in this in this case and then you have a mistrial and then your
lawyer says right we've got to start from scratch here's my bill for the new trial and you're like
but now I'm you know hundreds of thousands in debt for the first trial I've got no assets left and
the lawyer may just walk away and you're stuck with a public defender which won't happen in
Galen's case because she's got this 20 million legal war chest but there is the possibility of a
mistrial she has 28 million dollars in assets but but some of those assets are tied up it's going
to be very hard for her to get financing I knew somebody who the family approached to try and
get her mortgages and they were told no people do not want to finance her and yes you are right
if there is a mistrial it could go the same way as this particular case Lyle Menendez Eric Menendez
you know a second case is another very costly thing the Menendez family were very wealthy like her
and the money is gone it's all gone because law law firms eat money I've had personal experience
of law firms and I've spent a lot of money on legal fees it is a very costly exercise
my friends who've gone through the legal fees I'm sure Sean you've spent your family spent
considerable money trying to help you in your case it is it is something you can't Jeremy
Bamber you name the case these people spend fortunes and once the money's gone it's gone
and in the legal system even if the second trial might lead to a verdict for which she prefers
getting back that money it doesn't it takes years and years I have a friend who went
he lost his home he lost everything in in a court system and he was eventually able
to get something back but it took it took her 10 years and that's 10 years of your life and you
you don't get that back so and and she is a 60 something year old woman by the time this is all
over if there were a second trial she'd be in her late 70s and frankly you know you lose the will to
fight what does a mistrial mean what things could trigger a mistrial in this case and what do you
think the likelihood of a mistrial is in this case I think the likelihood of a mistrial is
very low a mistrial would be based upon perhaps one of the alleged victims having told lies that
there are discrepancies I will admit in certain elements of certain stories
people have made allegations about certain people involved you know in the case of Prince Andrew
one of the victims said that something occurred after they'd been drinking cocktails together
Prince Andrew doesn't drink you know if there is enough of this that builds up into something
in her case then maybe something could be done for her but I don't see how that would happen
do you believe that Ghislaine will be called to the stand and she will accept that she will agree
to testify I actually believe that Ghislaine will want to be on the stand she's got the same
attitude as her father she loves as a public stage she is the only member of the family who
was alleged that their father was murdered this is a girl that does not follow the rules she
doesn't play by the rules and that was why she was the favorite daughter that is why the boat was
named after her and not her sister Isabel or her mother I think that this is a woman that will want
her moment because she's so angry with the world and why do I say that she's created a website
most people who are awaiting trial don't go around creating websites where they talk about
reading Boris Johnson's book they don't talk about how they share a cell with a rat that you
know they they keep themselves humble they don't go around annoying the judge by slamming themselves
into a prison conference room and blockading the door they don't do five bail attempts when
they've been told no four times already this lady doesn't sound to me like someone who will give up
she wants her moment and she doesn't believe that any of this is going to be lead to her conviction
she she she does what she wishes so in pre-trial you can't show any remorse as it would be taken
as an indication of guilt at trial what do you think her strategy will be if she speaks on
her home behalf is she going to protest her innocence is she going to blame it on the dead guy
um I believe that she will go down the route of blaming Jeffrey Epstein saying she didn't
know what he did um she wasn't so closely involved with him she continued to support him as a friend
because he'd been kind to her when her father died there'll be a bit of that um um she will
claim that these girls she doesn't know anything about them you know it wasn't her fault
she she is somebody who will have every angle covered so she can just blame everybody but herself
she is a selfish lady who has been over indulged for her entire life I've met many people of her
type once you once you are so spoiled and you're the daughter of somebody so rich you only have
to look at someone like like say Philip Green his daughter his daughter you know another example of a
spoiled young lady who just misbehaves she took up with a convict who I actually had a child with
and now she's around now he's been chucked out and you know these people they do as they wish and
they have no concert they have no acceptance of the consequence of what their families have done to
ordinary people will the prosecutor be calling survivors to the stand I would think that Virginia
Roberts will be there I think perhaps Anushka Desjardins who I've met on a number of occasions
who subsequently went out with David Hasselhoff there may be others the Maria Farmer there will
certainly be the key person in my view the man who did the technical things on the island who
I think he is somebody who seems to know a lot more than others there will be a lot of staff from
the home in Palm Beach the home in New York perhaps the ranch
I don't think there'll be anybody from Britain
so doesn't that have the possibility of opening Pandora's box because you mentioned earlier
that Ghislaine under no circumstances will mention the Clintons and I assume Prince Andrew
but the survivors have no such restrictions so if Virginia recounts the episode on the island
whereby underage East European girls were I'm just going to say to you for my
engaging activity with Prince Andrew Maxwell and Epstein all participants if Virginia recounts that
in the federal court system isn't that going to just like the world's going to go crazy the news
is going to be crazy there's going to have to be you know investigations launched more indictments
pending I I think those people were capable of saying whatever they wish to say but Prince Andrew
will just simply refuse to travel to America and that will be that and the British government will
not want a diplomatic incident and the American government will not want a diplomatic incident
but there are other people who are less important you know you only have to look at the fact that
the French were so easy to arrest this Jean-Luc Brunel they got him you know there are certain
people who can be sacrificed so if Epstein was suicided to prevent
what Maxwell presents right now this very same threat is there a fourth possibility then we got
guilty not guilty mistrial is there a fourth possibility that she may not even survive
before this trial commences I am not a conspiracy theorist I don't know whether Jeffrey Epstein
was killed or not killed it seems from the likelihood of possibilities that he was allowed
to get himself to a position where he could do that kill himself I would think the man realized
his time was up and he thought I better go I think that is highly more likely than him being
killed but he could have been killed I I don't know I I'm not a conspiracy theorist I don't think
she will kill herself because she is somebody who has the arrogance of her father she is a survivor
I don't know whether Robert Maxwell killed himself I think he fell off the back of the boat and he
probably just gave up on the will to live because he knew his time was finished but I don't think
she actually has reached that stage she is somebody who continues to cause trouble from her prison
cell she is still a nuisance she doesn't accept her situation yet and she has a website she has
PR people she has a man called Brian Basham who is that he ran the dirty tricks campaign for
British Airways and a man whose name I won't mention who trolls me continually who was involved
he was chucked out of UKIP to end up in the Conservative Party and he has a website and
these people are completely under her thumb they do as they're told and they spin her lies
this is not someone ready to give up I don't think she's prepared to go yet
so again then the situation that was remedied by Epstein's death is now imminent because of the
possibility of trial these big names that could potentially come out must be feeling a bit um
embarrassed embarrassed and we've got to do something about this before it's too late kind
of thing because well they're all they're they're the the famous names are are all trying to spin
their way out of it you know Naomi Campbell um we talked of earlier I have a quote from her here
somewhere yes I knew him I was introduced to him my 31st birthday by my ex-boyfriend Flavio
Briatore a good friend of Bernie Eccleston he was always front row you know I've stood next to
hundreds of people to take a picture what he's done is indefensible I was sick to my stomach
I didn't know about him you know I stand with the victims this guard for life they all have
a they all have a little story as to why they um you know were with him and some of them unfortunately
have stronger connections the pair of them than others so the address book
you know if you are Bernie Eccleston you're in the um you're in the address book with
with a phone number and a fax number that's it the address if you're Prince Andrew you have 17
phone numbers if you're the Duchess of York you have about the same um there are people who are
very closely aligned with them and then there are people who are just pure acquaintances I've
spoken with people who the general public wouldn't know of English aristocrats people like that they
were people that she'd known when she was at Oxford University they were her friends you know
every one of us has met people and we've given them our phone number and then we've never ever
heard from them again and if they were to go on trial the police could come to us and say
you're in the address book you're a danger you could be what did you do and you could say well
I met this person once and that was it and then there are other people who were like the Clintons
they went well Bill Clinton he went on that plane over 20 times how can that man say he
didn't have a friendship with that person if you are if you're going on someone's private plane 20
times you have developed a relationship with that person it's slightly different to just meeting
you know if we just met at a party in this very room last night and then we'd sat down and had
a drink today that is a very different thing do you think that Naomi Campbell was just present
when these trafficked girls were being abused or do you think there is a deeper involvement
I think that Naomi Campbell is probably in the same position as Lady Victoria Harvey
that she spent considerable amounts of time with Jeffrey Epstein
probably Naomi Campbell was not his type but maybe Naomi Campbell introduced other people to him I
don't know whether that was the case but I think that was the motive of having her in the room
and I'm sure for Ghislaine it was probably the same thing and there was probably the
connection with Leslie Wexner and Victoria's Secret so Lady Colin Campbell who we recently
interviewed caused massive controversy on I think it was breakfast TV in the UK
and one of the themes was eberphile versus pedophile I didn't even know what an eberphile
was until recently what comments do you have on that controversy I personally think that
she made a very grave error I don't know the lady I've never met her I've been in the same room as her
I think what what Ghislaine Maxwell is alleged to have done and what Jeffrey Epstein was convicted
of having done is reprehensible disgusting revolting evil sick and wrong and I can go a
lot further and I think people like that it doesn't matter what label you attach to them
they are disgusting and they should be punished for doing something so reprehensible and wrong
to children you don't abuse children and there's no excuse for it so I have very strong views on
this sorry so do you think that at trial Maxwell will throw some people under the
bus but they will be lower level people and we know already that the legal quagmire of
investigating people who had been procured who later became procurers has been solved because
all those procurers now those alleged procurers have agreed to testify against Maxwell so who's
left for her to throw under the bus if she can only go down and not give up any of the bigs
well I have been sent lists but I don't know what list is true of course I know as much as
the magician at the end of the road you know who who has a clue who she's going to actually go
after but it's it's been mostly actors and minor politicians people none of you would ever have
heard of it will not be the big names it won't be Donald Trump it won't be Bill Clinton it won't
be Prince Andrew that one person who has written to me has who claims to know has suggested Prince
Andrew will be thrown under the bus but no I don't see that happening she she is not a stupid
woman I will say that she's a very very bright lady and she knows where her her allegiances lie
and she is still in connection according to one of my sources with a former wife of Donald Trump
in prison I don't know whether that's true or not because obviously none of us know we we don't
know really what's going on but the person who has given me that information is somebody I believe
um she she is more likely to destroy people she thinks won't be able to fight back
so the possibilities we've roamed over so far are guilty not guilty mistrial
and last minute plea bargain the sixth possibility then is that the trial date is moved to next year
which side would request that do you think upon what grounds and is there a possibility that that
may happen um Gillian's lawyers have already requested that the trial be moved because they
think it's unfair to the jury that they miss out on Thanksgiving and obviously Christmas could get
in the way you know she she uh she wants her turkey and she wants it now you know she wants
everything she's a bit like Eloise at the plaza hotel you know but she's sadly in the Manhattan
detention center but um she is the one trying to have the date moved the judge wants to get on with it
so concluding this interview then I think up the title will probably be what next for Maxwell
or you know what's going to happen at Maxwell's trial do you have anything to say in conclusion
on this matter I think that um Gillian Maxwell would be wise to do a plea bargain I don't believe
Gillian Maxwell will do a plea bargain I do believe Prince Andrew should go and face the FBI and
answer some questions I don't believe he will and I believe all the other people who are trying to
spin their way out of this would do well to try and be assistant but do the right thing and that is
all I have to say really so a huge thank you to Matthew Steeples for sharing his information
