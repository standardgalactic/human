What's up, Matt? We're back. We're back with Matthew B. Cox, the con man to the stars,
aka short king.
The last video did good. What?
The last video did good. Did it?
Oh, you did it here? Yeah. Yeah, the one that you did here, yeah. How about the podcast
that you and I did together on your channel?
That was good. That got, you know, from my channel, that got good results. Like, everybody
liked it.
What kind of comments were on there?
Everybody liked, everybody liked Danny. They were like, he was way more interesting than
they thought. It was a good interview. Like, oh, I didn't know that. Hey, wow. Ooh, you
know,
Give us a like the whole fucking time.
No, they don't know anything about him. And then there was a whole thing like, bro, you
could tell more was going on with the whole Ben thing. Danny totally like, you know, he
totally avoided the.
I swerved it.
Yeah, just, they were all, it's, you know, it's funny listening to the comments or reading
the comments where the guys start getting into arguments and they get pissed off and
that's the first podcast I've ever done as a guest.
It was good.
So thank you for popping my cherry.
I don't like the way that sounded, but yeah, yeah, it's good.
You popped my podcast, cherry. Cheers.
Oh my God.
So what's going on, Matt?
What's going on in your world? Where did you just went to that conservative coffee shop
to show off all those fucking absurd Trump paintings?
Yeah.
Did you sell any there?
No, I didn't even show them.
I didn't.
Okay. So there were, there was a woman that watches my podcast, her name's Noreen and
she bought a couple of paintings like a few months ago.
She'd seen like the Trump painting and she bought two of them and then she was coming
down.
I forget where she's from.
I don't know, Ohio or Michigan or something and she came down and she said, Hey, I'd like
to meet you at, and I'm going to conservative grounds coffee, would you want to meet me
there?
And I was like, sure.
So she wanted me to give her a signed book.
So I met her there, gave her some signed books and that was it.
Do you know, we did a whole documentary on conservative grounds.
You saw it?
Yeah.
I saw it.
That's how I, as soon as she said it, I knew exactly what she was talking about.
Oh, really?
I was like, oh, no problem.
I'll meet you there.
That was a pretty funny documentary we did.
He's pulling up the comments of your podcast with me.
They're pretty positive.
Yeah, they are positive.
I think, I think this is a podcast that we were all waiting for, especially if you're
a fan of concrete and Matt.
That's right.
I love all the positivity in here.
So Don Pierce says, I have respect for this guy now.
For me?
You got to respect it.
He didn't respect you before that though.
Respect.
No, that's what I got from him.
Not before that.
So you look at the negative.
I look at the positive.
I look at it.
I look at it as a glass half full.
You look at it as a glass half empty.
Woo!
Glass.
Woo!
Glass is full of shit.
You want to hit?
Goddamn, those smelling salts are strong.
All right.
So was this lady dressed up, decked out in MAGA gear?
No, she's the retiree.
She was really nice.
I had a friend with her that lives somewhere around here.
She was really nice.
And she won some of your books?
She bought some of my paintings and then she asked me to bring a book so I brought several
of my books and I signed them and that was it.
Yeah.
Nice.
What kind of paintings did she buy?
Two Trump paintings.
Okay.
They're big sellers.
She's got to get back to her hotel room just in time for Tucker at 8.
You know, Jessica Kent when she did my podcast, she asked me to take the Trump painting down
Really?
Yeah.
Why?
You know, she's just not a fan.
She said take it down?
She goes, can I get you to take it down?
And I didn't know how serious she was and I was like, absolutely, of course.
No problem.
I mean, you know, I'm not, you know, I'm not married to it.
I was like, yeah.
You mean, was it in the background of the video?
It's in the background of all my, all, well, I've got like, usually I have four paintings
up because I've got some paintings they're called modified, they're modified screen prints
so I paint them, you know, I paint them, then I do a screen print over them and then I paint
other stuff on them, you know, and then I, you know, put a couple coats of varnish on
them and the whole thing.
So, but Trump was up there and it's a big seller.
That's so funny.
Like, I'm not, you know, I'm not.
Is a big seller bigger, bigger of a seller than Biggie?
The Biggie one is dope.
The Biggie one is pretty cool.
I love the purple and the gray one.
Can you see these on the camera?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Okay, cool.
Yeah.
Those are badass.
The Biggie one's cool.
Yeah.
I don't know how to push them.
People see them in the background and they'll randomly send me an email saying, bro, is
that painting for sale?
I'm like, like, yeah, I want the Marilyn Monroe and I'll sell them a Marilyn Monroe
or they'll say, hey, do you have one with like green hair?
I do have one with green hair.
Funny, you should ask.
Say that, you know.
So I sell them every once in a while.
I don't push them.
I need to start pushing them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sure.
What was that?
He told, you told me the most epic story about Trump the other day about the guy that
was golfing with him.
What was that story?
I was on a golf podcast.
He was a pro golfer.
He went, he was golfing with Trump and they were on, it was just like him and Trump and
they had all the Secret Service or whatever out there, little ways behind them or whatever.
And they were, they were golfing and they're like, all the Secret Service like rushed in.
They were like, we have an air breach.
They were calling it an air breach.
So like somebody was flying into the airspace where they're at.
So they're like, I don't know.
They got all together to protect him or whatever.
And they see this little fucking Cessna putting through the air over the golf course.
Probably some old guy and then like 10 seconds later, they're watching that Cessna and they
said two fucking bomber fighter jets.
Just zoom in, shooting flares at the fucking plane, turn out of there and get the hell
out of there.
And so they fly by, they shoot flares at him, get him out of there and they're like, okay,
Mr. President, there's it's safe.
Now you guys can go back to enjoying your golf game.
And he said he walks over with Trump and Trump looks at him and he goes, that's power.
And then tees off and then fucking hits the ball dead serious.
You're safe now.
I was always safe for overreacting.
You know, Trump loved that though.
Oh yeah.
Super handicap.
Oh my God.
You know, he's fucking counting.
He's shaving hell.
He shanks into the woods and the Secret Service probably grabs it, tosses it back out to the
green.
Yeah.
Did you see that movie?
Did you see that movie?
Yeah.
What is that from?
Yeah.
I've never seen that before.
And that was great.
Is it Richie Rich?
Who goes to this little town and he, you know, he hit the ball.
He would play golf and they would be Secret Service agents in there.
I've seen that.
That was an epic movie.
Matt, what's this fit you're wearing today?
This is brand new.
I've never seen you dress like this before.
I know.
He came like this shirt.
He came here last time.
You got these.
You got like semi baggy khaki pants on and you got some brand new boots like you just
bought them today.
They don't have a scuff on them.
Not true.
I wore them a month and a half ago.
He was wearing the same outfit.
Yeah.
How many times you wore them?
I wore them.
I wear them every once in a while.
What did you do today?
I wore them a few times a week.
I mean, I had to meet these two women.
I had to come over here.
Today I painted.
You just wanted to stomp up in conservative grounds.
You know what else?
You know what I did today?
Get up.
Get up.
Stand.
Take your headphones off.
Step back.
We want us to see your outfit right now.
It looked like you just started working at the Pinellas County Nature Park or something
for the county.
Look at this guy.
Yeah.
You're fine.
Look at this guy.
This is not the normal Matt Cox attire.
Look at this guy.
He's got the belt to match.
Look at him.
Matt, you're glowed up, bro.
There's more behind this.
What is going on here?
Who took you shopping?
No.
Did you go muddin' today or something?
I don't know what to say.
All right.
He's got the tight, breathable shirt tucked in with the belt.
Yes.
This isn't normal Matt Cox attire.
No.
I'm trying to figure out what's going on here.
I had, you know, I stepped up my game a little bit, but I can't keep wearing the same white
shirts all the time.
So you know, periodically you got to throw in, you know, something, a green one.
And it was kind of form fitting and looked good.
Makes you look buff.
Makes me look good.
I lost about 10 pounds.
10 pounds?
How'd you lose 10 pounds?
You weren't fat before, were you?
No.
I don't think I was.
I mean, I just, I had some issues going on.
I wasn't hungry for a couple of months.
I lost some weight.
It just caught up with me.
Weren't hungry for a couple of months.
I just, I don't know.
I was just emotionally fucked up.
It was a bad time for me.
You're depressed.
I was a little depressed.
There was some depression.
She's raising her hand.
It's just his fault.
There was some depression.
So you weren't eating?
I wasn't eating very much and I dropped, actually I dropped probably 15 pounds from
like 175, not, down to actually like 158.
So if you weren't eating, you're saying you weren't eating before, but now that you're
not depressed, you dropped, or you dropped weight?
No, I dropped weight then.
Now I'm up to, I've gained three or four pounds.
No, no, I gained three or four pounds, I'm like 162, 161.
Wow.
Actually, I was 160 when I got out of the shower today, but still.
You weigh the same amount as I do.
I weigh 165.
You're like six foot tall, or 5'11", what are you, 5'11", 5'10", whatever.
If you're over 5'6", you're a giant.
Oh, fuck.
Hey, well look, you dropped a few pounds and Jess is back.
Right, well, yeah.
You should've did this months ago.
Yeah, well, that's a story.
We're proud of you.
Unbelievable.
You're doing great.
Yeah.
You're doing really good.
Fuck.
By the way, you were commenting on my phone, you want to know where I stole it from?
Where?
Vice.
Vice.
I did it for you, Matt.
Nice.
Nice.
I stole it from Vice.
They gave Matt his credit.
No, they gave me.
They also gave me.
I love how he said in the last pocket.
They paid you.
They paid me.
He said, I don't even need the money.
I just want the credit.
No, I know.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They got the credit.
And now we got the money.
Love it.
Love it.
Nice.
And they got him on a gag order, so now he can't say nothing about you.
I feel like you do about Ben.
You do.
Very accurate.
Good times.
Good times.
I mean, you don't have anything.
What do you want to talk about?
What do I want?
I want whatever you want.
I don't care.
What are you doing?
What's going on?
I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm paining.
What did you do today?
Today, I, I printed out cute cards.
I mean, I really wanted to eat a couple gummies and just see where the podcast went.
I printed out fat flashcards for the 48 rules of power.
What are the 48 rules of power?
48 laws of, 48 laws of power.
Robert Green.
Robert Green.
Yeah.
I have that book.
So I, I made flashcards.
I made flashcards with the 48 laws of power and made flashcards and I cut them out and
I glued them on the flashcards and, and when you're like studying it, trying to memorize
it.
I don't know.
I think I'm thinking about maybe trying to memorize them.
It's got to be fun.
It's a cool book, but after I read that book, I didn't even read the whole book, but it
makes you want, it makes you, it changes you a little bit and like how you think is it
makes you want to apply those laws into your general life.
And then I noticed I started doing fucking mean shit.
I didn't.
Yeah.
Kind of mean stuff.
Not shitty shit, but like you just kind of, you just, you kind of use people a little
bit from that.
And I don't know.
It's weird.
Yeah.
Why?
How?
Explain to me.
I don't know.
It's hard to explain, but it's like, can you explain it?
Just even like if somebody was coming, I remember that like when, if somebody was coming
over, I'd think of a reason for them to stop somewhere and get me something and bring it
on the way.
Something, you know what I mean?
They're vicious.
They're vicious.
They're total psychopath.
That's cult shit.
You get things out of them.
That's cult shit.
No, no, no.
It's weird.
It's cult shit.
It's power.
They're like power.
Have you heard of nexium?
Okay.
So it's basically their rules to apply to help you succeed in life, but it's not like they're
nice rules.
No.
There are some harsh, harsh rules.
Like it's like, give me one.
Well, one of them is like, I think rule number one is don't, don't never outshine the master,
which means your boss never make your boss look bad, never look better than your boss.
Because although you think you're trying to impress him, what you may be actually end
up doing is he may become jealous.
He may become, you know, upset about it, fearful, fearful of you.
So it's like manipulation strategy.
It is.
Oh, it's very manipulative.
There are tons of manipulation strategies in the word for it.
Definitely.
Yeah.
There's, there's a bunch of them.
But it is a cool book.
There's 48.
A bunch of them.
There's 48 of them.
48 manipulative laws.
Yeah.
That what's so funny is what's great about it is when you, when you read it, you start
seeing it not just in yourself, like I definitely can see some of them myself.
And then there's some things I think, you know what, I need to start doing that.
Yeah.
I'm not harsh enough.
Like I'm, I tend to forgive people that screw me over and I, and I, and I, in this it's
like crush your enemies, not only physically, but in spirit.
Like don't leave one in bur burning or it will reignite the person and the person will
come back and destroy you.
I mean, they're, they're vicious laws.
But I always, you know what I'm saying that there's, there's little tiny, they're little
tiny things that you think, you know, like I really actually kind of need to do that.
Cause I tend to get people in little pieces.
I think it's a good.
Yeah.
And you notice things in other people, like you realize that's why he's doing that.
He's behaving like that because of this.
That's law number 22 or not law number 31 and you start going, that's why.
Okay.
Now I know what he's doing.
Now I'm going to do this.
Have you ever heard of, I'll ask you again, have you heard of nexium?
I don't, I've heard the term nexium, but I don't know, or I don't know what it is.
It's a drug, right?
It's a, no, it's a cult.
It was a cult run by a guy named Keith Ranieri.
Oh, is this where the, the sweat blog, large things or no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
It was a, it's basically a cult where they stole basically everything out of, out of
Scientology and they stole all kinds of shit from Tony, Tony Robbins.
One of the founders, they taught like all the strategy of all the strategies of Tony
Robbins, all the shit that Scientology teaches you, like get in there, better your
life, push out all the negative influences, figure out how to work your mind and be successful.
And, and all of their victims were super successful, wealthy people.
A lot of them had money.
A lot of them were like, came from royal families.
And, um, this guy was just like, he was a crazy, super successful entrepreneur.
First, like he started a Ponzi scheme, made fucking tons of money.
It was not a Ponzi scheme, it was an MLM.
And he, uh, he got in trouble for that.
He didn't go to prison for it, but he got in trouble and they had to dissolve the
company, but he made millions of dollars.
And like this guy was just like a hustler.
And he was like a very like short, fat, awkward, look proportioned human being.
He was like a, he looked like, he was like Charles Manson stature, but like fat,
kind of chubby.
And, and he was just fucking just driven successfully, like driven to like make
money, to like build this big company.
And he created this company called Nexium, where it was all about like personal
power and it was like one person will recruit another person, just like a
multi-level marketing scheme.
And, uh, they would bring them in and eventually it turned into sex trafficking.
It turned into this.
Wow.
That turned left.
Eventually it was like women getting branded.
He could, he, he, he mind fucked all these people to believing that they were a
part of this great thing.
And, uh,
Well, so did that Scientology.
Yeah.
He's a fuck shit.
Like that's him.
They were branding each other.
All the women were branding themselves with him at his initials.
Um, and, uh, he was like raping, raping 12 year olds and shit.
Like convincing them that was their pathway to enlightenment.
Was to have sex with him.
Like he would convince the higher, the higher ups in his, in his company, the
cult that convinced, like tell them, like to tell the women, like, Hey, if you
really want to, to get up in this, you know, and really like elevate yourself in
Nexium, you have to seduce Keith.
This was like his plan that he would tell the higher ups to convince the lower
level women and then they would now be trying to sleep with him to like raise
their status and their spiritual enlightenment.
And it was just this craze.
I just watched the whole documentary on HBO.
It's fucking bananas.
What's the name of it?
It's called the vow.
The vow, the vow.
Yeah.
And, uh, he, he fucking paid the, he paid the Dalai Lama, like a million dollars
to have a meeting with him.
And so they can videotape it and make himself look legit.
And the Dalai Lama met with him.
The Dalai Lama was like questioning him.
He's like, well, he's like, I don't know.
He's like, a lot of people say a lot of negative things about you.
You've been a part of some weird shit.
And he convinced the Dalai Lama.
Well, don't they say the same thing about you, Mr. Lama?
And like, Mr. Lama, this guy played himself off.
Like he, he projected himself as just like this super high IQ, genius
of a man who was a judo master at age 12.
He was like, could play the piano like Beethoven.
He knew he was a mathematician.
He was a scientist.
And in reality, he was none of this stuff.
He just projected himself like this and all these people were in awe of him.
And he just fucking took control of all these people over all these years.
And now he's in prison for life.
Would you consider him a con man?
Oh, bro, he was the definition of a con man.
He was the fucking most, he was the purest form of a con man you've ever seen.
He ripped off everything, everything from Scientology, from Tony Robbins
and made it look like he fucking created all of this himself.
And anyways, it was, it reminds me of that book that you were just talking about.
A lot of the same kind of shit.
When you introduce people to those kinds of ideas for the first time.
Well, they'll say stuff like in that book, it's like Law 31 or whatever.
And it's like, you know, create large scale like acts of, you know,
to make yourself seem godlike, you know, emphasize enthusiasm over, over, you know,
you know, facts or whatever, you know, over reason, you know, do you?
It's got all these different techniques on how to make yourself seem huge.
And, you know, amazing when, in fact, it's it's just bullshit.
But it's really, it's a lot of what you're saying right, right there
seems very much right out, taken right out of that, those laws.
And it's the same thing as Scientology as well.
No, I don't know.
One thing they do, one thing they do to the women that go that joined that company,
it's like they have this relationship to where the person above you is your master
and you're considered their slave.
So there's this thing called collateral.
So if you want to elevate in the company and make more money,
you have to give them collateral, meaning you have to give them
like your darkest secrets or send them like nude photos of yourself.
So that if you ever come out or want to leave, they have this against you
because they're like, oh, we're giving you access to all this high level information.
We need collateral from you.
The same thing is like, you know how Scientology does the auditing.
They do like those auditing sessions where you confess, confess like your deepest
darkest secrets and thoughts and ideas and everything.
And they make notes of everything, like everything from your past or whatever.
Okay.
It's the same kind of thing.
It's called auditing and Scientology.
This thing it was just called Inexium.
It was just called collateral where you just give them dirt on yourself, basically.
Seems like a bad idea.
But these people were brainwashed enough to do it.
I like the branding part.
I'm good with the branding.
Yeah, just brand all your women.
I'm thinking about, yeah, I'm definitely thinking about doing that.
Yeah, I'm thinking, I'm thinking about having Jess get a tattoo on her arm that says
Property of Matthew Bevin Cox.
Yeah.
I think that's reasonable.
I was this close to having her talking into it the other day.
Brands are cool.
Brands are cooler than tattoos.
We know a couple of tattoo artists who can make this happen.
Brands hurt.
Do that?
But at least it's all at once.
Yeah, yeah.
It's over quick.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, you're gonna-
It's not an hour session.
No.
We're talking five seconds.
Four to eight hours of the course of two weeks.
Fuck that.
Let's get this over with.
Where did this guy do all that stuff at?
It was in New York.
Like, I think it was Albany, New York.
That's where that shit was based out of.
Albany.
Albany?
Albany.
Whatever.
Albany.
Albany.
You think Frank Almedao likes the 48 Laws of Power?
He, listen.
You think he follows all 48 rules?
Absolutely.
Hey, pull up a picture of Keith Ranieri.
I want to show him a picture of him.
Or like an interview with him or something.
He could be Almedao.
Yeah.
He is very, I mean-
Bro, you know what's weird though is like all these people, like this guy,
Charles Manson, who else?
Who's another big-
Who's the leader of Scientology?
Miss Gavage.
They're all short guys.
They're compensating for something.
They're all short guys.
Compensating for the shortness.
I don't know, but is that a thing?
Like, they're not only are they short, but they're like oddly proportioned.
Like, you know what I mean?
I feel like this is-
I don't know.
I don't know.
Is there a connection?
Maybe that could drive you to one of-
Is there a connection there?
Shed that image of yourself.
Why can't you see me?
I don't know.
I don't know.
We're having a conversation, Matt.
I don't know.
He's implying you're one of those people.
I was gonna be your one of those people.
Keith Ranieri, R-E-I, just type in like N-E-X-I-V-M.
You'll find him.
So why did he go to prison for life?
They got him for like basically like cooking the books of his company
and sex trafficking and I forget his actual charges, but they nailed him down.
I love that you got-
You have the same image of, you know, God and Adam that you used to have the painting of.
I like that you're the consistency.
Yeah.
It's nice.
As soon as you make-
So you should have framed the TV.
What's like that gold frame?
I know, I wish I could have done that.
Like the picture.
You could do that.
Yeah, it would have looked like a picture, so.
That'd be cool.
The frame TVs are expensive.
Maybe you could frame this one.
Yeah, yeah, I could just like custom make a wood frame.
Michael's gonna do it for you.
Damn, Austin, what's going on, bro?
Yeah, he's gonna have-
Jesus.
Why would he do that?
He'd buy you a six-pack and grab you some two by fours.
Right, right.
You'll not get-
Bar the drill from the next door.
We built this table.
This guy looks like a-
He doesn't look oddly proportioned.
Yeah, you gotta see a full body shot of him.
Like this is just from the chest up.
Okay, look at it.
Yeah, look at that picture of him.
You can blow-
I don't know if you can blow that up.
Look at him.
Looks like Spielberg.
You know, does he look like a fucking dork?
I just think it looks like somebody from the 1980s or 90s.
Yeah.
Yeah, a bad suit.
And baggy-ass suit.
And he has like the mo hair cut.
Maybe it was very Christmas-
Have you ever heard of Heaven's Gate?
Of course.
That's another crazy cult.
That guy was nuts.
Never heard of it.
Oh my-
What?
You've never heard of Heaven's Gate?
Was it a hundred?
Oh my god, you gotta watch that documentary, bro.
Sixty-
Was it 60 people?
Thirty-five people.
Thirty-five people that-
wearing Air Jordans.
Air Jordans, no, and the full jumpsuit.
They did like a Nike jumpsuit and like Nike tennis shoes
or Air Jordans.
Yes.
And they all took poison and killed themselves.
Because there was a comet coming by the-
What was the comet named?
Halebop.
Yeah.
But coming close to the-
Close to Earth.
It was like a hundred million miles from Earth, which is close.
Which is close.
Pull up the trailer.
They're the ones that-
Pull up the trailer.
No, no, that's-
No, no, that's Jim Jones.
That's Jonestown.
Pull up a-
That was almost a thousand people.
That was a lot, right?
That was a thousand people.
That was a thousand people.
No, the Heavens Gate, they thought in the tail of the comet was a spaceship.
Following it.
That was-
No, wrong one.
And they were gonna go-
And their souls would go up into the spaceship.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
What if they did?
Yeah.
That's Heavens Gate.
Heavens Gate cult documentary trailer.
What if-
What if their spirits did?
I know, that's what I'd say.
Maybe.
They could have.
Maybe.
They could have.
But, bro, they-
I mean, it's as silly as-
It's as silly as Christianity.
Hmm, you're-
Why not?
Who's to say?
But still, the Nikes-
No, it's a little bit-
I didn't understand-
Some kind of Nikes where they-
It's a little bit sillier.
Like where they Jordan ones or what?
The Cult of Colts, this documentary.
This is the leader of it.
This guy?
Yeah.
Did he-
Watch this, watch this, watch this.
Did he cut his-
Did he cut himself?
Oh yeah, they tried to castrate each other.
Because they-
May or may not, you think they just decided to fucking-
Nikes.
Nikes, they weren't Jordans.
What kind of Nikes are they?
Air Maxes, I think.
They convinced them all that they were aliens,
destined for a hire to transcend their bodies.
Beam me up, Scotty.
Definitely an alien.
Sold.
How?
Probably never.
Tim Doe, we're hearing what Ann constantly on the move,
and the FBI said there's really not much we can do about this group.
Dove said we're gonna proceed during the castration.
But who's gonna go first?
Do exactly as I say, and you will not know better.
By killing themselves, they insured their immortality.
They signed out, lost all of Easton, maybe.
People say, who do you think you are?
Is this the Cult of Iberhead?
Yes, it is.
It's the Cult of Colts.
Oh man, that was a good documentary, bro.
You would like it, bro.
You should get high and watch it.
You think it worked?
You want to get some Nikes?
Convince them that if they wanted to be immortal
and transcend into a higher level of existence,
they had to commit, they had all killed themselves at the same time.
Did they all get castrated?
No, after the first guy got castrated, it went so wrong.
It went really, it went left hard.
And the castration is so wrong.
Well, they had one of the, one of the cult,
one of the people in the cult was like a ex-nurse or whatever.
She's like, I kind of know what I'm doing or whatever.
So she helped.
So I know what I'm doing.
Kinda?
She assisted.
I got a fucking knife.
Yeah, so she, I guess she helped with the first castration.
And it went so bad, they had to rush him to the ER
because he was like bleeding out.
And after that, they didn't do any more castration.
Castration.
We don't really have to do this, you know?
I mean, we thought we did, but we actually don't.
Felt like a good idea.
Yeah.
Well, because aliens, the alien, humanoid alien beings
that we're all accustomed to seeing or accustomed to being familiar with
from like sci-fi films or whatever, they're genderless.
They have no balls or dick or vagina.
So that's what they wanted to do.
They all wanted to become genderless.
Now you don't have to cut your nuts off to do that.
Yeah.
Now you don't have to cut your nuts off to do it.
True.
They were ahead of the time.
They were just ahead of the curve.
All right.
What else?
That shit was wild, bro.
The hell?
Jonestown.
Jonestown was.
That was a while.
I did watch the documentary.
I have not watched that one yet.
Oh, man.
That one's dark.
That's the darkest one of all.
Listen, that he, he, they,
they, they were made it right though.
Some of them didn't drink it.
Ran off into the woods.
Wasn't there like a senator who flew down there?
Yeah.
They killed them.
And they shot them.
Yeah.
They shot them.
I mean, him and his, and his whole kind of staff that went down,
like they went to Jonestown because there was,
they had called them to what, Ghana.
And they'd moved there and they'd created Jonestown and they were building this utopia.
And, you know, they're all not doing well and they stopped talking to their family.
And so finally the senator who's been petitioned by tons of family members
flies down there to set, just to kind of check, inspect the whole thing.
And everybody's saying everything's great.
Everything's good.
And they're like, oh no, we're happy.
We're, they're shaking.
Oh no, look, hi.
How are you shaking his hand?
And then people are putting notes in his fucking hand saying,
help me.
Give me out of here.
I'm being held against my will.
I don't remember that part.
Right.
So then they, whatever, I forget.
What's the name?
It's Jonestown.
What's Jones?
His last name's Jones.
Jim Jones.
Jim Jones.
Yeah.
Jim Jones finds out.
Well, he tells him, just before I think the senator tells Jones,
Jim Jones, listen, I got issues.
There's some issues.
Like some of these people are being held.
We got a problem.
Yeah.
We got a problem.
We're going back to Washington.
We'll let you know what we come up with.
And they go back to the airport.
And Jim Jones sends his private peep, his private security.
Sends his private security to stop them.
And they have a shootout and they kill them.
And then they come back.
And they now know that the government's good.
Like the US government's going to come in.
They're going to come in and grab him.
So he convinces everybody that it's the end of days,
you know, and that they're coming.
And he convinces everybody to drink the Kool-Aid.
It wasn't even Kool-Aid.
It wasn't the brand.
It was a knockoff brand of Kool-Aid.
And it was laced with cyanide and some other stuff.
Isn't that how that whole analogy drank the Kool-Aid started?
Yeah, that's where it came from.
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Listen, bro, I ain't drinking the Kool-Aid.
That's crazy, bro.
That was the biggest.
I used to say that in RDAF all the time.
That I ain't drinking the Kool-Aid.
What's RDAF?
It was the drug program in prison.
It's like a cult, practically.
You get in and the guys start, they start saying stuff.
And I'd always say, listen, bro, like I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Cults are interesting.
Super interesting.
They're so interesting, because they're just like religions,
except for a couple key things, like the whole disconnection thing.
Like you can't associate with your family,
or like you have to disconnect with them.
If they call you a suppressive person,
like that's how it is in Scientology and with Anexium.
Like if somebody talks to you.
They would remove, like most cults try and get you away
from all your family to be in one place.
Like in that way, you're so rounded by everybody else
who has the same thought process.
Before you know it, you just become brainwashed.
Right.
Crazy.
And it's all like, a lot of them are smart people,
which is crazy too.
Have you, did you ever read, I think it's Chuck,
he wrote Fight Club.
I want to, I'm going to butcher his last name.
Oh yes, I love that guy.
I love that guy.
Well, Chuck, Paul in the check.
I want, and I'm probably butchered his last name.
He wrote a story called Survivor.
And it's about a guy who was in a cult who gets out.
And it's, it's great.
Really?
Great book.
Great book.
And it talks about all, all the cults as you're going
through the book.
He's talking, he talks about different,
they keep bringing up different cults.
I'm looking this up right now.
It's a hilarious, but listen, he's got,
Chuck Paul in the check has better books than Fight Club.
And of course you know.
How do you spin that, pronounce that?
P, P, A, L, A.
Paul in the check.
P, A, L, A, H, N, I, U, K.
Yeah, come on.
How are you going to say that?
How do you say that?
Palinuk.
I really, I really wish.
Story of Survivor being developed for TV.
Which, what, which one is it?
Dark comedy from Palinuk.
Folks is on Tender Branson,
and member of the British cult who has survived
his religion's latest mass suicide,
only to hijack a plane by himself
with plans to crash it into an Australian outback,
into the Australian outback after he tells his life story.
Whoa.
Whoa.
It's good.
It's a good book.
I mean, it is a girl.
I don't know what the.
I'm going to check that out.
That guy is fucking cool.
I love that guy, Chuck Palinuk.
Yeah, Fight Club, honestly.
That's a good book.
Yeah.
But he's got other books.
You read the book?
You've been, what, Fight Club?
Yeah.
I read almost all, every book he's read.
I was in prison.
Really?
Yeah.
How many books did you read while you were in prison?
I mean, I read for like,
probably the first three years straight.
Wow.
So I don't know.
It was probably a book, maybe two books.
Probably two books a week for three years.
God damn.
It was ridiculous.
A week?
I guess you have nothing to do.
What do you think the difference is between
reading a book and listening to a book?
Have you done both?
Yeah, but I mean, I'm a horrible reader.
Horrible reader.
I'm a better reader now than.
Well, you told me that you just highlighted
the speech thing on the phone to listen to articles.
All the time.
So, but do you think there's, I mean, obviously,
it's quicker to listen to a book,
but do you think you grasp it?
Everybody's different.
Do you think you digest it the same way?
No, I think for me, listening to it,
I retain more listening to it
than I do reading if I have such a hard time reading.
I think the opposite.
But you're probably a great reader.
No, but I'm not.
I'm a slow reader.
It takes me four times the time to read a book
than it would for me to listen to a book.
Because sometimes I go back and I reread it.
I have to go back.
I can barely read.
Like I read one paragraph.
I'm like, did I get that right?
I got to read it again.
Yeah, I just listen.
But I had no choice in prison.
You just got to read it.
Right.
There's no way to get audiobooks in prison.
You can't get like a little iPod or something.
For a pretty penny, you can.
Yeah, if you want some guy's suitcases for you, maybe.
I mean, fuck it.
No, no, no, no.
You know what's so funny is like in the county jail and stuff,
you know, in the count, like now in the county jails
and most prisons, they're giving you iPads
and all kinds of stuff.
Like they're turning it.
It's a money-making venture now, more so than it ever has been.
How do you think, how do you think, how many books
do you think you read while you're in prison total?
I don't know.
I think two a week is probably.
So total.
It was definitely two weeks.
It was definitely two a week in county.
When I was in the county lockup, I was for a year.
So that's over 100, over 100 right then.
Really?
Um, and then I would say, let's say 70 when I got to prison
for about two years, 70s.
I don't know.
So about 250 books within three years.
Wow.
How many books do you think you've read in your lifetime?
Single digits.
But I was the same way.
I was the same way before prison.
I was the same way.
I probably read 10 Dr. Seuss books.
Run to the back.
Same way.
If those count.
But like big books.
No.
I remember one time in middle school, they were like,
they took the whole class to the library.
You got to pick a book.
You got to read it.
You got to write the fucking whatever.
You got to write something on it.
I'm like sweating, walking up and down the aisles.
Where's the smallest book?
And I had the best idea.
I'm like, you just buy a book that's about a movie
and you watch the movie.
Take a couple of notes, write a paper.
I got fucking E.T. out of the library.
When I watched the movie, I already seen it a hundred times.
I'm a kid.
Easy.
Nailed it.
Didn't read a page.
Not one.
That's genius.
Well, I'm like, what are you doing taking notes,
watching E.T.?
Got a report.
Miss Willis, I got to turn this in tomorrow.
Miss Willis.
Crazy.
You know how they'll take the book
and then they obviously they have to adapt it.
For like a, for a movie.
So you got a 300 page book.
You can, unless you want a 12 hour mini series, you can't.
So they chop it up, right?
But there were two books that I've read
that when I saw the movies, they were almost identical.
One was Fight Club and one was Catch Me If You Can.
Almost identical.
Because they're so small.
Fight Club was like 190 pages.
Did you hear what China just did to Fight Club?
China has changed the ending.
What?
Why?
You know how China manipulates all their media
and all of their internet and everything?
Right.
They just changed the ending for Fight Club.
So if you watch Fight Club in China,
it's no longer like the city falling.
Now it's, the FBI comes in and arrests Tyler Durden.
Wow.
I'd like to watch that.
Yep.
Why?
I wonder why, which is because they don't like the idea.
They don't like the idea.
Take it down.
Take it down.
They don't like anarchy.
Right.
It's frowned upon there.
Yeah.
Yeah, you could say that.
They've been embraced it like we have here.
They're not, they're not, they're not trying to take the capital.
They'll be no, they'll be no Russian Congress in China.
Could you imagine video footage in China
of people taking over the capital?
Oh my God.
That'd be a hell of a movie.
Bro, I mean, they already, they already made a bunch of documentaries
about January 6th.
Good times.
The QAnon one, what was the QAnon one?
Into the Storm.
That's a fucking crazy documentary.
Talk about a cult, bro.
Politics is like a cult.
Close.
It's kind of like a cult, right?
It's like the fine line between cults and religion and stuff like that, right?
It's the same thing, like cults, religions.
Cult just in a tip over the line, do some weird shit.
Politics.
This podcast sucks.
Does it?
We can stop it right now.
And I'm a part of it.
If you're not having fun.
Sell something.
If you're not having fun, we can turn it off.
I'm having fun.
Well, I mean, you're, I mean, how much stuff do you guys have in front of you?
I have marijuana.
We have smelling salts.
We have scotch.
We have coke.
The cola cane.
No cocaine.
If maths probation officers listen, it's no cocaine.
Just coke, coke, coke, coke, coke, coke, coke.
China changes the Fight Club film ending.
So the authorities win.
The ending of the cult 1990 cult film Fight Club has been removed for viewers in China
and replaced by a screen with a message saying the authorities won.
Scroll down a little bit.
They're not even, they're not even trying to be subtle about it.
No production value at all.
Just fucking text on a screen.
Scroll down Austin.
All right, hold on.
Yeah, I want to see Paul, what Chuck said about it.
He says, this is super wonderful.
Everyone gets a happy ending in China.
Do you think there's a pun in that?
That's great.
He said this is super wonderful.
Everyone gets a happy ending in China.
That is fucking, he is fucking so smart.
He is so funny.
Bro, I'm subscribed to his sub stack.
Bro, I'm subscribed to his sub stack.
I don't know what that is.
You know what a sub stack is?
No.
Sub stack is like a email subscription thing.
So like, like reporters or journalists or writers like him who write all the time,
like you subscribe to their email list.
Sub stack is like a, it's like, it's like think of like YouTube, but for also for like writing
shit and people subscribe to it and they pay you like a dollar a month or five dollars a
month or ten dollars a month or whatever.
It's like a Patreon kind of, but for like people like him.
So they don't have to be tied to like, you know, they don't have to like depend on
big mainstream corporate media to pay their bills.
They can just have the people pay for their shit.
Just like you do.
Get a subscription to the articles.
Right.
So you pay like five bucks a month and you can get all of his content that he writes every
single day that he's interested in.
I'm trying to think what another one I read was a choke.
They actually made a movie about choke.
Which was another great, great book of his.
Monster.
Monster was good.
There was one called monster.
Wasn't as good as choke and survivor was great.
I've watched both of his, but he did a couple of podcasts with Joe Rogan.
I just watched those.
Okay.
And you know, that's how I became a fan of his.
Well, obviously after watching Fight Club,
I think he got like $10,000 for Fight Club.
Like he sold the really?
It was, he said at the time, I was thrilled to get it because he said,
like I had written the book.
He said, I mean, nobody was interested in publishing it.
He found the publishers and said, look, we'll give it 10 grand for it.
That's all you get.
No royalties out here.
10 grand.
He's like, I'm sure he sold a lot of books from that though.
Well, yeah, but he didn't get any royalties on his book on the other books.
You're right.
No, no, he didn't even write the book.
No, like he's pretty sure he sold it for 10 grand and never got any royalties.
I thought he sold like the movie deal part of it.
No, no, no, and I could be wrong.
But, you know, keep in mind that that's what turned him into a massive,
you know, paid off.
Right.
I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure I got that right.
But yeah, because he said, I remember him saying, look, it wasn't,
at the time it was a ton of money for me.
And I was thrilled to be, I was now a published author or whatever.
You know, he was like, I was thrilled.
You know how he got the idea?
He said he had gone camping and the guys at the other campsite were playing
loud music.
I think he said, I got up, you know, and was just disturbing everybody.
That he got up and went over and said, hey, can you guys turn your radio down?
And the guy mouthed off to him and they mouthed off back and forth.
He said, and we ended up getting into a fist fight.
He was like, I got beat up.
He said, and that's when he sat down and he thought, you know what, I'm like,
I've never like been in a fight.
Like, and I just got beat up.
Like, I don't even know how to defend myself.
And he said, and that's, that was that sparked the whole concept for Fight Club.
Wow, that's awesome.
Yeah, it's really cool.
That's crazy.
Do you know that, um,
I'm going to say I lost my train of thought.
I hope you have the camera on Matt for that pause.
That was like, hey, you know what?
I need a hoodie.
I got hoodies.
I got smalls.
Yeah, smalls.
What color do you want?
I want a large, I want a large.
Because I can, you gave me a medium.
Last time you gave me a medium, it was tight.
Was it?
Yeah, it was too small.
Oh, but you know what?
I've lost some weight in my work.
It probably worked out good now.
Look how you got some muscle going.
This is all for show.
This is, I'm weak as a small child.
Are you okay?
Bro, I'm trying to remember what I was going to say about Chuck.
I had something funny to say, but I forgot what it was.
Lost it.
He's a good shake.
Oh yeah, he's pretty buff.
I'm trying to think of the other books I read of his.
God, there was another one.
Oh, I remember what I want to say to you.
Have you ever read Stephen King's book on writing?
No.
Pretty interesting.
You know what's funny?
The only Stephen King books I like are the serious ones.
Like all of his books that are scary or about, you know, aliens.
Kujo?
Yeah, but Kujo's good.
Okay, sorry.
I'm saying typically like the ones where they go off on, you know,
whatever, the strain or, you know, like those types.
Like I don't like any of those, but when he, you know, like Misery
or the Green Mile or, you know, those are Shawshank.
I think he wrote Shawshank.
Like those are amazing.
And then, but everybody's known for all the horror books and stuff.
And I didn't really like any of that.
I don't really like those.
The more fiction it gets, the less you like it.
I don't like them, but the serious ones, he's, you know, those are like amazing.
His book.
No, he did Shawshank.
I'm pretty sure he did Shawshank.
I don't think he did.
No, I didn't really did the Green Mile either.
Who wrote Shawshank?
Redemption.
No, but he did Misery, right?
I don't know.
You guys make me second.
You're so sure about it.
No, I'm not sure.
I'm just saying I didn't know I was surprised.
All I know Stephen King 4 is like it.
Shawshank.
Bro, he was broke like late into his 40s.
Like he had no money.
And he hit big on, what was the girl's name?
Yes, Stephen King Shawshank Redemption.
Okay.
That's cool.
Yeah, I didn't know that.
What was his first one?
His first big one, his first big sale where he made it.
He got rich off was Annie.
Annie?
The little red-haired girl?
Yeah.
The girl who goes to prom and then, and then.
The hard-knock life, Annie.
Is that what it's called?
No, no, you're thinking.
No, I know.
I know you're talking about where she can set fires and right.
Well, the girl gets made fun of in high school and they go to prom.
And then she sets the whole building on fire.
Right, exactly.
Didn't they just remake that?
Is the Shawshank by, is that him?
Or no?
Oh, it is.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.
Carrie.
Carrie, Carrie.
Yes, Carrie.
Andy.
You said that right.
Andy.
Andy Dufresne.
Oh, here.
Oh, you did?
Sorry, we can't hear with the headphones on.
Yeah, Carrie.
That was his first, that was his first hit.
Yeah, Misery, Misery, the novel by Stephen King.
Yeah, he wrote that too.
That's it.
I saw the movie.
That's a good movie.
Yeah.
Bro, he talks about-
What's that lady's name?
Oh, God, what is her name?
Oh, she was so scary.
Oh, she's so scary.
Oh, and, you know, in the book, like they, you know, they hobble him in that,
like she just breaks his, again, in the book, like she cuts his feet off.
You know how they, like when slaves would run away,
they would cut the first part of your foot off.
Who plays the guy in that movie?
Is that fucking Vince Vaughn?
No.
And some guy looks like him, isn't it?
No, no, it was, um, no, I forget.
What is his name?
How old is the movie?
It's some, it's somebody weird.
You wouldn't expect to play that role.
Yeah, yeah, I can, if I can...
What's that lady's name?
Rosanne.
No, no, it's Kathy Bates.
Kathy Bates.
And James, uh, James...
Franco.
Can't, uh, James Cain.
James Cain, I have no idea that was.
C-A-A-N, am I saying that wrong?
C-A-what?
C-A-A-N.
I've never seen that in that movie.
I've never seen that.
Oh my god, bro.
He's a, you love it.
He's a writer, he writes novels, like, like love novels, or romance novels.
And she loves the characters and novels.
And then he, like, has his, his manuscript or something with him.
And she knows where he goes to type his manuscripts.
And when she's coming back, she actually, I think, whatever she does,
she calls it an accident or something.
She finds him, brings him to her house.
I think she make, calls it the accident.
And she reads the manuscript and she's disappointed,
because in the manuscript...
Oh yeah, she makes him rewrite it or something, right?
Yeah, she didn't like the way it ended.
Yeah.
She wants him to rewrite it.
She traps him in the house, fucking makes him rewrite it.
He talks about this whole thing in the book,
his own, uh, his own autobiography book, on writing.
Oh.
I remember hearing about that.
Yeah, that was fucking crazy.
And then he tries to get away.
Yeah. And she cuts his feet off, right?
In the book, in the book, she, she hobbles him.
She takes, cuts the first portion of his foot off, right?
So he can still, he's got his heels.
His toes.
Yeah, it cuts basically a little bit behind the toes.
Cuts the toes off.
The bunions.
Right. So you can't run.
You can't really, you kind of like, you know, you're like on stills.
Yeah.
Cut half your foot off.
But in the movie, she just breaks his legs.
Oh yeah.
So she kind of breaks his feet, like.
And she's like a hardcore fan of his.
Oh yeah.
Knuckles.
I mean, you're, I gotta watch that movie.
Ankles.
Oh yeah, it's a good movie.
Classic.
You should listen to it.
You should listen to his audio book.
It's fucking good, bro.
Who, Stephen King?
He talks about his whole process on writing and how he writes.
And like how he has to set up his own little space where he does it,
how he's learned.
Because you know, he was at one point when he was writing
shit like Kujo, his best work,
he was locked in a room,
fucking doing rails of cocaine,
drinking tons of fucking whiskey,
eating pills.
He was fucked up.
Is she writing?
Maybe I should try it, huh?
I mean, that's all you're missing, bro.
Is a fucking couple of books.
He was doing mountains of coke and writing these stories.
Like how crazy is that?
Give me a pen.
You gotta say.
Yeah, that's a problem.
You just don't have a pen and a piece of paper.
Yeah.
Like it's fucking, that's wild.
Could you imagine, I couldn't imagine trying to be productive
doing that kind of shit.
I mean, I don't know.
Some people are crazy.
Like who's that guy that did fear and loathing?
He was crazy like that too.
Oh yeah, Hunter Thompson.
He used to take all sorts of fucking gnarly drugs.
Same shit, yeah.
A lot of those guys.
What was the stuff called that we were talking about?
Adrenochrome.
Adrenochrome.
Have you ever heard of adrenochrome?
No.
It's when you, they take it out of babies.
They like take the blood out of babies.
Not necessarily babies, but typically younger humans.
It's adrenochrome.
So it's like adrenaline, like pure adrenaline from young children.
And it supposedly makes you.
Who thinks this crap up?
Like, hey, you know what?
Bro, go to Behemoth.
Really jack us.
They say it's real.
It's real shit.
No, but I'm saying, that's what I'm saying.
Who thinks, hey, you know, it would really be good?
Let's take some adrenaline from small children and inject it.
That's what they do.
That's what I want.
Adrenochrome.
Horrible.
Yeah, he wrote Green Mile.
Yeah, I didn't know he wrote all that stuff.
Oh, I knew he wrote Green Mile.
Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Bro, he's, all of his best shit was done when he was on Coke.
He says it in his book.
Same.
Fucking wild, bro.
Oh, my God.
Wild shit.
Now he's like, what is he worth?
These weren't like a fucking billion dollars.
It's outrageous.
Then he got hit by it.
Didn't he get hit by it?
Oh, yeah, he got hit.
Yeah, he got hit by a car, right?
First of all, he was like jogging along like a road.
Like, what are you doing?
You're jogging.
You're on the country fucking road.
You're jogging along or something like that.
And some guy like veers off the road and runs you over.
Like, I get it.
You live in the country, but...
He was in another country, wasn't he?
I had treadmill.
No, no.
He was like, I think he was just in the country side.
Oh, really?
I think.
And it was like a minivan ran him over.
Like, oh, my God.
Wow.
I mean, it's just embarrassing.
Nobody deserves...
Probably turned that into a story.
Nobody deserves to die by a minivan.
I feel like some people just do their best work.
Like, there's a certain point in their life
where they just like create the best shit.
Like, people like Hamlet created people.
And then it's over.
And then after that, there's like a,
it's like an uphill, uphill, uphill.
They hit a peak and then there's like,
it's downhill from then on.
Like, there's a certain point.
That's where I'm at.
The money.
That's where I'm at.
The money comes in.
Where are you at?
You're on the down?
On the down.
Yeah.
But sometimes you can find another little,
another hill after that.
I just need a little one.
Yeah.
Well, let's sell some paintings.
I mean...
Austin, you having trouble?
Yeah, it's pretty hard.
Adreno Chrome.
Adreno, A-D-R-E-N-O Chrome.
Jesus.
Adreno Chrome.
Oh my God, did I, I didn't bring any Marilyn Monroe's.
I have some Marilyn Monroe's.
Those are big sellers.
You didn't bring my Gucci man either.
The biggies are good.
No, I, I'll, I'll do that.
I didn't know you were serious about the Gucci man.
I wasn't positive.
Of course I was serious.
I mean, we don't know how big do we want Gucci.
Am I ever not serious?
Well...
All right, Adreno Chrome.
Read this for us, Matt Cox.
Can't read that.
I can't even say it.
Adreno, Adreno Chrome is a chemical compound
produced by the oxidation of adrenaline, adrenaline.
It was the subject of limited research in the 1950s
through the 1970s as a potential cause of schizophrenia.
Cause of schizophrenia.
While it has no current medical application,
the related derivative compound, what does that say?
Carbazochrome is a hemostatic medication.
What does it say?
Small children.
Despite the compound's name, it is unrelated to the element chromium.
Right, but well, how do you get that?
I don't know.
I mean, I, I immediately pictured like a couple of doctors like
cuffing some kids to a bed and they're squirming and there's...
Well, I think it gets, it gets a play into cults and shit
where they say, you know, people do shit like that.
You know how they say Hillary Clinton needs babies and drinks their blood?
That's what they're getting from it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But.
Oh my God.
And this is, what happened?
What about this, the Hillary Clinton, the sex ring that was being run out of the...
Oh, you mean, you mean, Jeffrey Epstein?
The basement.
Oh, Comet Pizza.
Pizza gate.
Oh yeah, Pizza gate.
Yeah, that's just...
Yeah.
A lot of that is based around this.
Yeah.
It's like they're, they're, they're harvesting kids for this adrenochrome.
And then they get freaky like Epstein and he builds a whole damn island.
Bro, I'm watching this documentary right now called,
It's the craziest fucking documentary I've ever seen.
It's called, uh, 9-Eleven, The New Pearl Harbor.
And they go, it is the deepest dive on all of the little things about 9-Eleven.
And basically, bro, it, it will fuck.
It, they, they, it's very objective where it's not just like a one-sided thing where they say
conspiracy, conspiracy, conspiracy.
They take all of the conspiracy theory debunkers of 9-Eleven.
Like all of the people around the world who say 9-Eleven,
it is what the government said it was.
Right.
It was, it was Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden.
That, that...
I'm not sure Saddam was part of that.
No, they, they did.
That's what they said.
That's what they said.
The war on terror was that they implicated Saddam Hussein.
They, they tried to.
There was never was any proof, but like there's no, there's no proof.
But that's how they justified.
Yes.
That was one of the ways, one of the ways.
Yeah.
Just like the weapons of the master's dress.
Right.
Just, just like, uh, um, Pearl Harbor justified going into Germany, right?
Or Japan.
Japan.
Yeah.
Um, anyways, they make all of the connections, all the, they, they, they,
Pearl Harbor was, they were attacked and then, and then because they were allies,
Hitler then declared war in the United States and he had already been at war.
It's all connected.
Yeah.
There's, yeah.
I'll go with that.
That's cool.
So they, bro, they go all the way down to like, they go, is granular as to where they're in the
Pentagon with Dick Cheney and they have a little Dick Cheney Dick Cheney in the Pentagon with his
chief of staff, the, uh, all of like the, the lower, the lower wrong people who are like in
there and they're, they're tracking the airplane that's had the last plane that's headed towards
the Pentagon, right?
They're tracking it from like 80 miles away and it's like 80 miles out.
The kid comes in the room, sir, 80 miles out.
Does the order still stand?
It goes away.
Sir, 70 miles out.
Does the order still stand?
The footage?
No, this is all documented on the report.
Okay.
And then he comes back in like every 10 miles, he comes in and tells Dick Cheney.
It's like, sir, 10 miles out.
Does the order still stand?
What does it order?
Not to shoot it down?
They don't know, but they're, they're, uh, assuming that it's not to shoot the down,
shoot it down because at 10 miles.
Because they're not shooting it down.
Right.
And they're not shooting it down at 10 miles out.
Dick Cheney snaps his net back and says, of course the order still stands.
And the kid is obviously distraught and there's multiple people in there that,
that testified to this.
The kid goes back away.
Five minutes later, the plane fucking crashes into the Pentagon.
Okay.
Another, another big thing about the whole Pentagon thing is the Pentagon is a giant,
like what?
It's like four stories.
It's not a very tall building, right?
No, but it's like the largest building.
But it's, it's 30 acres.
It takes up 30 acres, but it's only like four stories tall.
Right.
So think about it.
If you're a hijacker and you're going to take a plane and crash into the Pentagon,
are you going to take it?
The thing took out like four power lines while it was going 500 miles an hour,
fucking 50 feet above the ground to just to crash into the side of the Pentagon.
If you're a hijacker, a fucking low level pilot who's not a very,
not an expert pilot, you're just going to crash into the roof of that thing.
Cause you're going to, you're going to do way more damage.
You're going to cause way more destruction.
Rather, you have to be like, they make, they make the case that you have to be like,
they show flight simulators with trained pilots and they show exactly how hard it would be
to fly that plane 50 feet above the ground at the, at the, for the distance he did
to crash into the side of the building.
Any, any fucking hijacker would just crash into the top because you do more damage.
And it'd be way easier.
So that's just one of the examples they make, which is fucking when they lay out
all of the reasons why it's, it's, doesn't really match up to like the narrative.
It fucking really blows your mind.
That you should watch this.
I'd like to see what you think about it.
They still hit the building.
I mean, yeah, he hit the building, but it was, there was nobody in that part of the building
as well. No, there were, there were, there were like a hundred people died.
They said that area was under construction.
No, that, that, that part of the building was the only part of the building that had
just finished construction.
They just redid that whole part of the building to make it
like they, they, they insulated every single wall with Kevlar.
They made it fireproof.
Oh yeah.
They had just the windows.
Yeah.
They just put in new windows.
Yeah.
So listen, I was locked up with a guy named Chris Marrero.
Chris Marrero got, I think 15 years for filing income tax return or filing something to get,
to get money back for people because it, Chris is one of these, he's a sovereign citizen
and he believes that the government uses our social security number to borrow money against us
and the money doesn't exist and that you get a, listen, it's, it's total like insanity.
And he was filing paperwork for people to get them the money back that the government gets for
whatever. It's, it's insanity.
And he ends up obviously, then he goes to trial and he ends up getting like 15 years.
He believes in every single conspiracy out there.
I've never met anybody that can tie conspiracy theories together.
And he, he was so entertaining for me.
Like we would just, we would sit, Boziak and I would sit there and go,
you know, fuck, what are you doing?
I don't know, man.
What are you doing?
I go, let's go find Chris.
You go, oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
And we'd go and we'd talk to Chris and Chris would go on and on and on.
I bet you he's got conspiracy theories with 9-11 that would blow your mind.
I'm desperate to get him on my podcast
because Chris will go for 10 hours straight.
And, and the great thing about him is you can kind of mock him and he doesn't bother him.
Like he's not going to flip out on you and start swinging.
He's not going to throw, you're not going to body slam you.
You know what I'm saying?
So like, but Chris will just go on and on and, and they're, they're amazing
because he's like, oh, I can prove it.
I got the book so and so.
And he gets so jacked up and excited about it.
He, he's hilarious.
Right. But here's the thing.
What, what do you think makes it a conspiracy theory?
What, what defines it?
Like, do you think like the whole, everything I explained to you, the whole 9-11 documentary,
you like, can we call Chris?
What makes it a, I'm asking you, what makes it a conspiracy theory?
That is not an official report.
What's your definition of a conspiracy theory?
That basically you're saying that it's not what it appears to be.
Like, you know, you're saying it has an ulterior storyline or it's something,
it's something more, it's something more sinister than what they're telling us.
That's the conspiracy theories.
They're saying, this is what it is.
It's pretty cut and dry.
It's pretty simple.
And you're saying, no, no, what really happened is something super sinister that they're hiding.
Like JFK, what do you think about JFK?
I mean, I think he got shot.
He got shot.
Do you think Oswald acted alone, acted alone?
Some, it depends on what documentary I watch.
You know, unfortunately.
I think now, I think now is accepted.
The documentary that said he acted.
I think now is accepted narrative that he didn't act alone.
Right.
I don't think that's any longer distributed.
We talked about this last time, like UFOs.
Like the government basically came out and said, yeah, there's UFOs.
We don't know what they're.
Nobody flipped out.
Like nobody jumped off a building.
Like nobody, nobody, people aren't going nuts.
They're not stormy.
Because they didn't say anything else but that.
But I mean, they slowly kind of let out over the course of what, 50 years.
And now people are so, had basically come to the conclusion that they believed they were USO.
So when they finally said, there are, there are, and we actually have some footage.
Well, look at it this way.
We were like, yeah, I knew it.
Look at it this way.
And they go to work the next day and pay their mortgage.
Look at it this way though.
Like, we got to call Chris.
Why do you want to call Chris?
Chris is so entertained.
If you got Chris on this, on this podcast, bro, you can't, I want him on my,
I've never meant to really mention him before because I want him on mine so bad,
but he's on an ankle monitor.
You got Andrew Bustamante on this podcast.
I know.
No, he, listen, he blows Bustamante.
Bustamante is like a, he, he just, he's a, he follows.
He's a CIA shill according to the comments.
Oh yeah.
I love that.
But, but he's, he's going with the, he's going with the standard line.
Yeah.
Bustamante is going to go.
He's not going to go.
He's not going to go.
This guy will go nuts and he believes in giants.
He's tied in Christianity with aliens.
He's got, I mean, it's.
The Anunnaki.
Oh my God.
We got it.
Chris, we have to get, we, oh, Chris ain't lying, bro.
Chris spit Vax.
I would love it if you.
I would love it if you watch this 9-11 documentary.
I want, I want to watch it.
I want to know what Chris's favorite number one conspiracy theory is.
I'm, I'm asking him about the number one.
Ask him about, specifically about the plane, the crash to the Pentagon.
What do you know about it?
Okay.
What, what do you do?
Which, where's the, hold on.
Where's the speaker on this?
You can tap him right into the, to the, to the headphones.
What?
No, it has to be.
Hey, listen, I'm doing a podcast and I have a quick question for you, Chris.
What?
My question is, what do you think happened in 9-11?
What really happened?
We're having a discussion about it.
There's a total inside job.
Did Cheney ask him this?
Wait, so this guy has this thing about chain, what was, what's the question?
Did Cheney have a do not shoot down order for the planes?
Yeah, Nora, he made Nora stand down.
Because there was a bunch of, there was a bunch of training games going on on like,
in like the Midwest, United States.
So all of the fighter jets.
And at the same time, there was a training going on, correct?
So they were confused as to what the hell they were supposed to do.
Was he really confused?
Where's this guy live?
I need to get him on here.
Oh, bro, he's, he's,
There was also, if you realize, there was also something called the new American.
And the new American was a, was a group that got together.
One of these, you know, mind together groups.
And they said they needed an incident like a new Pearl Harbor.
Have you watched the documentary at 9 11, the new new Pearl Harbor?
They needed an incident like a new Pearl Harbor.
Because they needed to get rid of Saddam Hussein.
There were no weapons of mass destruction, as you know, it was all bullshit.
It was all sold by CNN.
And they needed to get rid of Gaddafi, but that had already happened.
But anyway, it was all an inside job.
If you look at building seven, building seven fell down on its own imprint.
And there was no plane that hit it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But the building seven thing that that, I don't know about building seven,
the building seven thing that wasn't building seven full of like some sort of like chemicals
or gap, wasn't it full of like, no, it was full of files and information that they didn't want to get
I heard that it was stored.
They were storing all kinds of like chemicals and shit in there.
No, no.
And if you notice, there was a camera on that building for hours.
Now I was in TV and video, it takes time to set up a camera with cables.
And that camera was set on building seven and recording for hours.
What about the plane that hit the pentagon?
The pentagons, what four stories tall and it's a 30 acre mile wide footprint.
Why wouldn't they crash into the roof?
Wouldn't it be easier to like like crash the plane to the roof cause more destruction than it would
just to be to like fly the plane 50 feet above the ground and hit this.
First of all, it was a cruise missile.
There was no plane.
There was no tail.
There was no fuselage.
There was no wings.
There was no baggage of people.
There was no dead bodies, 250.
There were no, to your point, there were no images of any plane remnants or anything.
Like there was no video.
There was no plane at Shanksville, Pennsylvania either.
Right.
You can see the planes flying into the towers,
but there's no footage or photos of a plane flying into the pentagon.
Right.
Okay, let's scratch this.
Let's go to something else.
Wow.
And there were cameras at the nearby Marriott that the FBI confiscated.
They didn't want anybody to see them.
We need those.
We need those.
Listen, I have something completely different.
I got a completely different one.
What about, what's going on, bro?
I got to get you on here.
Listen, what about this?
What about Oklahoma City?
The Oklahoma City bombing.
The Alpha B Marriott building, yeah.
What's your take on that?
There were three bombs in the building that never went off.
That was put in there by the CIA before, what's his name?
Did the, the truck bomb.
You got to get him on here.
Okay.
One more.
I have another one.
What was, what, what is the thing?
You guys have got to see 9-Eleven, The Road to Tyranny by Alex Jones.
I'm watching right now.
I'm watching right now 9-Eleven, The New Pearl Harbor.
Okay.
Yeah.
Have you seen that?
You got to see 9-Eleven, The Road to, write this down.
9-Eleven.
The Road to Tyranny.
The Road to Tyranny.
I was talking about Bohemian Grove.
By Alex Jones.
I don't know if it's still on YouTube or if they took it down.
What is it?
I was talking about Bohemian Grove.
What do you know about Bohemian Grove?
That's.
It's out in San Francisco, 150 miles out on the, on the woods.
They, they worship this big owl called Malik,
which is in the Bible on Leviticus.
This guy's Alex Jones.
Oh, yes.
You were sacrificing your children into the fire to have good luck in,
in, you know, farming and things like that.
Is there any homosexuals there?
They have what's called a cremation of care,
which is this really sick fucking ritual that they supposedly have an effigy of a child or a
human that they, they burn in, in the fire.
Supposedly it's an effigy and it's a place where they have all kinds of weird sexual things
and all that.
You should get a book by Catherine, Kathy O'Brien called the transformation of America.
And in there, she was a sex slave for the, for those people, for the, for the elite.
And a guy named Mark Phillips, who was the age and got her out of it.
Right.
But she had been a sex slave for years and she wrote a book called the transformation of America.
He can do this with any fucking thing.
What, watch, watch, listen.
What about the moon?
What about the moon?
Okay.
What, what about the moon?
What about the moon landing?
What do you think about that?
And he'll have books.
I don't think the moon landing happened in the first ones,
but the other ones did happen.
And guess what?
Guess what?
What happened when it rang like a bell?
Basically, you're gonna flip on this one.
When they took off the, the module that was discharged from the actual takeoff and it
hit the moon and the moon, the moon rang like a bell for hours.
That means it's hollow.
And they now, a lot of people think that the moon was actually towed into place centuries ago.
And it's that it's that it's actually hollow.
So I have a question real quick.
You know, the, the, the Navy, the Navy jets that got all those, that got those UFO things on,
on tape.
The tic-tac.
Yeah.
What do you think those are?
What's, what's.
The UFOs.
Are they extraterrestrial or are they, are they Russian cruise missiles?
Oh no, they're extraterrestrial, dude.
They're 25,000 miles an hour.
Yeah, they're extraterrestrials.
And they, and they stop and they go, they, they come down to the water and then they
shoot up to the, to the sky 80,000 feet or whatever.
How do you know it's not China or Russia?
Nobody has a technology for that.
So I, I, okay.
One, I got another one.
What, what about this?
And no, listen bro, like he'll, he'll have books and listen, you should have seen him in prison.
He, he, he had tons of books, like all kinds of pictures, books.
And this is in prison.
I can only imagine what he's got now.
But wait, one more thing.
One more thing.
Listen, this is another.
So what is the thing that, what's the number that you always look for the, the, what they're
borrowing money against our social security number and you can get, if you get your, what
was the name of the, the number you were trying to get that you got?
Your.
Oh, you mean the Q-SIC number.
Q-SIC number.
And what, what is, what is that number good for?
Why, why do you need that?
All right.
Well, every number that you get from the federal government is attached to a Q-SIC number,
which is an international trading system that they have set up through Fidelity and the SEC.
You just look up Q-SIC number.com.
You can even read about it or go to Wikipedia.
You can read about it.
But Q-SIC number, everything you get from the federal government, like your social security
number, your driver's license number, passport, and Matt, even the federal ID number that we
had in prison, all those numbers have a Q-SIC, a major Q-SIC number attached to it.
And if it has a Q-SIC number attached to it, it has what's called a pulling and servicing agreement.
And what they do is they add a bid bond, performance bond, and payment bond to it.
They, they actually securitize them and sell them as asset-backed securities on the stock market,
which are, you know, later connected to REITs and, and mutual funds and things like that.
So you understand at one point, hey, at one point you got in trouble in the state
and didn't you file something against the judge?
Or you tried to get your, your, your.
Oh no, I filed something against the judge to make her the trustee and she didn't like that.
She put me in jail.
Does he?
And you're, are you, did you ever get, uh, become a sovereign citizen?
Did you, that ever go through?
Yeah, yeah.
What is a sovereign citizen?
Yeah, what does it mean?
These guys are asking.
All right, basically, all right, there's the United States of America and the United States.
If you look up the United States go to title 28 section 3002 subsection 15a,
you will see the, the United States in capital letters as a federal corporation
that was actually incorporated just after the civil war.
The United, it's what's, it's what we have now, which is a, a fascist corporate military democracy.
What we had was the United States of America incorporated in 1787,
which it was a De Jure Republic.
And that's where you want to get back to.
That's where you want to be sovereign.
You're above the actual, uh, uh, of government because you have, and they pronounce it this way.
They say unalienable rights, correct?
You've always heard that.
Well, it's not unalienable rights.
If you look at the, what the word unalienable in the dictionary, there's no meaning to it.
Because the word is not unalienable.
It's pronounced unalienable rights.
Key word being lean, where the government cannot lean leviercies against you.
Yet we have now a fascist corporate military democracy.
And a democracy is the worst form of government before you have total tyranny,
which is what you've seen on the news and what's happening now.
Does he think we should have an autocracy?
So what real quick, sorry, Danny wants to know if you think we should have an
autocracy autocracy autocracy.
Should we be like China?
Should we be like China?
Fuck no.
No.
Then what else will their options we have?
You need a capitalistic system based on on on trade and that all that.
And what they have is pure communism mixed with capitalism right now,
but you don't have freedoms.
You don't have the freedoms we have here, even though we're losing those freedoms slowly.
Well, hey, listen, Danny wants to, we got to wrap it up.
But I'm going to talk to Danny.
Danny's the guy who's running this.
The podcast is called Concrete.
But we got it on YouTube.
Yeah.
But I'm going to, I'm going to contact you.
I'm going to give you Danny's information and see if we can try and get you on here.
Are you able to travel or?
No, I can't.
I got an ankle monitor.
You know that.
Where's he at?
He's in, where are you at?
Anyway, right now I'm in Marguerite and I work six days a week.
What's that near?
Marguerite is near Pompidon Beach.
Pompidon Beach.
Can you come to Tampa for a day with a probation officer?
Yeah.
If you get okay from the probation officer.
Well, hey, let me let me call you back.
Let me call you back.
I'm on foot.
Bye.
All right, bye.
Yeah, I know a lot of people who know all the shit that he knows.
There are a lot of people like that around here.
Bro, he's something else, man.
And he's got a great memory.
He's red-pilled.
He got red-pilled, like in the Matrix.
Yeah, he's great though.
We would go into his cell.
You could sit there for an hour and just, anything you could come up with.
What did he go to prison for?
He was running, he was charging people.
Like he would literally get your taxes.
He would do that thing where all the money you had paid in and interest and everything else.
He would, they'd come up with some calculation.
They'd apply to the government to get the money back.
And the government would cut checks for like $1.5 million.
They borrowed something like $30 million.
And guys were getting the checks.
And they were cashing them.
They're going through.
And then they'd get 10% of it.
So when they got caught, you know, they're saying,
well, no, no, it's perfectly legal.
You understand, you're on or this, you're on or that.
Look, and then this code and that code, they went to trial.
He and all these guys went to trial.
They lost.
Guys are getting 25 years.
He got like 15, 16 years.
Wow.
He was making phone calls.
He was just making phone calls.
What's dude's name?
Chris Marrero.
It's awesome.
He's wow.
Chris Marrero.
We got to get him on here, bro.
Listen, and he gets super animated too.
Like he gets all like, no, what happened?
He gets excited.
He's like, no, I'm tough.
It's exciting shit.
Hell yeah.
And he's, he's super smart.
Like you're like, but you know, he, he believes like every can,
everything out there, he has, there's a conspiracy.
What is the, what do you think about people?
Do you believe in any of the shit he says?
No.
None of it.
No.
You don't believe any of it.
Why, why, why don't you believe it?
You're not interested in that.
You don't think not one of them could be true?
No, I'm some sense thing.
There's some semblance in some conspiracies.
I'm not saying there's not, but I mean, not every, like,
not everyone has, you know, sometimes people just, they,
they, they, sometimes they, they blow up a building.
The guy's pissed off.
He puts, he gets some fertilizer and some diesel mixes it up.
He blows up a building.
He's an asshole.
There's just assholes out there.
Yeah.
I mean, everything like, like these kids shoot in schools,
he'll have a whole conspiracy behind it.
What do you think about the unibomers?
I've seen those too.
Like the Sandy Hook.
Yeah.
Oh, what happened was they were being crisis actors.
LSD by the CIA and they were in and you'll be like, what?
Well, the CIA LSD thing is real.
It's actually even pretty.
I know, but not for like Sandy Hook.
Right.
Like, I mean, he'll, he'll, he'll, there will be a conspiracy.
Give the CIA my phone number.
Doesn't take anything.
If he didn't take anything, do you know anything about,
about Columbine, about those kids?
Did you read anything about that?
I mean, did I read anything about anything about like,
I don't remember when that happened.
Yes, but I don't know anything that was Marilyn Manson's fault.
Yeah.
They listened.
Those kids were actually listening to Marilyn Manson
and that's the reason they did that.
I mean, they were, it's Marilyn Manson's fault.
Oh, come on.
They were deeply disturbed kids and they could have been listening
to Cindy Lauper and probably done the same fucking thing.
I mean, you know what I'm saying?
It's like, you're just disturbed and you're going to come up
with a reason to do something really sick
because you're being picked on.
Did those kids write some sort of like manifesto
before they did that?
They wrote some like.
I don't know.
I think they had written like journals and they were,
I think they've written about it since then.
Yeah.
Because I know Jordan Peterson has talked about reading their
like those kids lived.
No, they died.
They killed themselves.
Oh no.
Which ones, which ones are the ones that live?
Like now they're all like got life sentences or something.
Oh, I don't know.
Yeah.
He, because he, oh no, no, or wait, he read,
I think he read their journals or something.
Yeah, that's a Columbine.
Yeah.
Okay.
Then he had read the journals and stuff and he was like,
you know, here's, they were upset about this and this
and they wanted to go out and away.
But here's the thing.
Do you, like he talks about it, but like,
do you think they believed that they were doing the right thing?
Or do you think they believed they were doing the wrong thing?
I have no idea.
I haven't read anything.
I don't know enough to, all I know is
that they killed, they shot a bunch of their, of their own.
I feel like they think they were just saying, fuck it.
I mean, I don't think they thought they were doing the righteous act.
But I mean, think about it.
How many times in high school were you, you know,
or middle school, you know, were you, if you're being picked on or,
you get frustrated and you lash out.
Yeah, I never thought about killing everybody.
No, I never thought about going and getting an AR-15 and just
mowing anybody down.
But maybe I hate everybody or something, you know what I mean?
Right, but you get frustrated and angry and pissed off and, you know.
Some people snip.
Yeah, but these guys were like, they were like super premeditated with it.
Like they, they thought about it and wrote about it for months.
Yeah, but they, they, they, you know, got themselves into a,
They, they apparently from their, whatever they wrote about it,
they truly believed that they were doing the world of service
by getting rid of all these people.
Yeah, well, they were, they were assholes, you know.
Some people are just assholes.
Some people are just assholes.
That's true.
You know, especially if there's three or four of them together
and they've got access to weapons, you know,
and they're awkward teenagers with pimples that aren't,
don't have girlfriends.
And, you know, they were like, they were super young too, right?
They were still like teenagers.
They weren't even in their 20s yet.
Right.
They started thinking in their 20s.
What do you mean?
They were in their teens and they were all like teens.
Weren't they like 14, 15?
That happened.
I was like 10 years old when that happened.
Yeah.
I mean, I think they ended up, you know,
then they got upset and then they went in.
They just started executing people.
Yeah.
They're just little scumbags.
They had that documentary, Bowling for Columbine,
that one guy made.
What was it?
Well, he did Fahrenheit 911.
Yeah, Fahrenheit 911, yeah.
What was that guy's name?
Yeah, he was huge.
He did Michael Moore.
Michael Moore.
Yeah, I assume.
Yeah.
He interviewed Marilyn Manson in the documentary.
Did he?
Yeah.
What did he say?
Because they all blamed him.
The news blamed him for it.
They like banned a bunch of his shows, whatever.
And they were like, don't you promote this kind of stuff,
this imagery and this kind of thought process
and your music and everything.
He's like, what would you say to those kids
if they were here right now?
And Marilyn Manson said, I wouldn't say a word to them.
I would listen to what they had to say,
and that's what no one did.
Nice.
Boom.
Mic drop.
Well.
All right.
What are we doing?
Matt Cox.
What's going on?
What's up with your love life?
Let's talk about it.
Since we always do.
Yeah.
Nobody's got to listen to this.
You're back in love.
Yeah.
What is it?
30, 40%.
Back in love.
What is love?
I was always in love.
Matt's riding the roller coaster right now.
Usually, Matt comes in a little crying, a little sad.
Matt's riding a little hurt, a little hurt, a little hurt.
A little hurt, a little hurt, a little hurt, a little hurt.
A little hurt, a little hurt.
Last time.
A little hurt, last time.
Now he's feeling good.
I am feeling real good.
He's coming in.
He's got a new swag.
He's feeling cocky.
He's got a new outfit.
He's happy.
He's a new outfit.
Uh-huh.
Matt's feeling cocky.
This is Matt.
Every time he comes in the podcast.
What a classic song.
It just reminds me of the Beats and Bowman movie.
Matt's feeling good right now.
He's riding the roller coaster.
Yeah, exactly.
The roller coaster of love, Matt.
You're on the up right now.
That right there?
Copyright strike.
He's on the part where it goes.
Climbing up.
You're at tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
You're climbing the roller coaster right now.
You're on Space Mountain, Matt Cox.
We'll see.
You're about to run through the loop.
Listen, and she's on her best behavior.
Nothing in life is steady, Matt Cox.
Like the last four, five weeks.
If you were on an even line right now, you'd be dead.
Just like the heart monitor.
You don't want that.
I don't want that.
It's all about ups and downs.
Yeah.
It's all about ups and downs.
So my ups and downs are way worse than most people.
Like, you know, it's like 26 years in prison.
Dead broke, you know, tons of money.
You know, totally in love.
Your girl's long gone.
She's mad.
You're in a movie.
You're in a movie.
They steal it from you.
Place doesn't give you your damn credit.
But then you find out they have the credit in there.
Then they're cutting you a check.
Then they're back.
And it's like up.
And that's just, yeah, it's bad.
Matt, you're riding it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Well, that's good to see.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's hope life is good.
We don't have any more crying.
Me coming back here.
There will be.
I just didn't work out.
It's inevitable.
There will be crying.
Tears of joy.
When you putting a ring on it, man.
Are you gonna propose?
I said six months.
I said less.
So let's just six.
Matt is like the hopeless romantic.
Matt.
Can we go six months?
We'll do a ring.
Six more months.
You'll do the wedding.
We'll do a wedding.
Nice.
But just let's, you know, it's not that I don't believe you.
You and Jess.
It's not that I'm not in love.
Not that I don't think that you're all in.
Let's just.
Matt's got it all planned out.
Let's make sure.
Matt's got it all planned out.
Yeah, listen, listen.
I love the Mike Tyson thing.
Everybody's got to play until they get punched in the mouth.
That's right.
Like, listen, my plans, I'm getting punched all the time.
That plan ain't never gone my way.
So we'll see.
Are you guys, are you never going to have any more kids?
I'm a hundred years old, bro.
I can pick up a child.
What's your sperm?
I don't think I could outlive a dog.
Like his hairline.
What's your fucking A1?
I mean, I don't know what the sperm counts look like,
but I got them pills.
Everything's good.
That's different from the sperm count.
Everything's all right.
I don't need the sperm count.
Some women want babies.
Listen, we're good.
I'm good.
They got dogs.
You get a dog.
Yeah.
Not really a cat person.
Not that I don't like them.
They're nice.
I guess they're okay.
I just not a cat.
Bro, what is that thing that, uh, toxoplasmosis?
You ever heard of that?
Oh my God, bro.
How did you just come up with toxoplasmosis?
Look up, toxoplasm.
Sounds interesting.
So there's this shit that people get
that are around cats a long time.
People that own cats, they develop this fucking,
this thing in their brain called toxoplasmosis, right?
That comes from cats.
And it's a, it's like, uh, okay, here it is.
Toxoplasmosis is a disease that results
from infection with toxoplasma.
Wow.
A Gandhi parasite, one of the world's most common parasites.
Infection usually occurs by eating
undercooked contaminated meat, exposure infected
from infected cat feces.
That's why pregnant women can't go around cat litter
because of toxoplasmosis.
She knows.
Or mother to child transmission during pregnancy.
So it's this shit that you can get from cats.
So there's this thing.
It's this fucking parasite.
It's like this super fucking smart parasite.
It gets into rats, right?
Listen to this.
It gets into rats.
And the way that it gets transmitted to cats
is it makes the rats fucking dicks get hard
and get, it's fucking, gets super horny,
gets hard dick whenever it smells cat piss.
So all these, all these rats get super fucking horny
with hard ons whenever they smell cat piss, right?
So these rats are attracted to the cat piss,
which brings them near the cats.
Then the cats see the rats,
the fucking cats eat the rats.
Now the rat is in the cat.
That's how the fucking disease.
This sounds like a Dr. Seuss book.
Bro, that's how.
The rat is in the cat.
That's how the disease gets fucking transfers itself to the cat.
And now the cat hat, you mean the parasite.
The parasite, right.
And now the cat has the parasite.
And the cat.
Now the cat has the parasite.
And the parasite knows that humans like to keep cats as pets.
Yes.
So it goes into the cat.
Imagine if that was for like.
That's a next level parasite.
Imagine if that was like humans and grizzlers.
I don't know about all that.
So then the cat licks the mom and she gets the parasite.
That's what he's saying.
Passes it on to her.
That's smart.
So people get, find out what the, find out.
These quincements.
Find out like what the symptoms are like,
what the effects of toxoplasmosis is on humans.
Yeah.
Like what does it matter?
Like what is it?
Like do we have parasites all through our body?
What does it do to humans?
But this is crazy though, because a lot of people like,
a lot of cat owners get this.
Swollen lymph nodes.
Especially around the neck, muscle aches and pains,
headaches, fevers, generally feeling unwell,
inflammation in the lungs.
I have all that.
That's it?
Cure that with a joint.
How do you know if you have toxoplasmosis?
Doctor can do a blood test to see if you have those antibodies.
Anyways.
Your cat definitely has that.
Do you have a cat?
Your cat's out there roaming around eating,
eating all sorts of stuff.
I got to cut a kid.
For the first time.
You what?
I got a cat for the first time a year ago.
But my cat's an outdoor cat.
Okay.
My cat, at night, we let him out.
He fucking roams the streets.
He goes from, he neighborhood hops all night long.
He shows up at the doorstep at 7 a.m.
He comes in, he eats, and then he goes back out.
That's how I want to live in life.
Yeah.
Show up to somebody's house, eat.
You don't have to pay for fucking shit.
Roam the neighborhood all night.
Come back in, eat.
That's living.
Get up and do it again.
And he's not fixed.
He's humping the whole goddamn town.
He's humping all the cats around town.
And all the rats are getting hard balls and dicks
and eating his pee.
I am not, the hard balls, I don't know how that entered
in this whole next level parasite.
I don't, I mean, we got to get, I'll bet if we,
I'll bet Chris has the whole thing.
Imagine if there was a version of that
with humans and grizzly bears.
Where a human just got fucking horny and fucking,
grizzly bear piss.
Grizzly bear piss.
The grizzly bears just fucking ate us.
What is happening?
I got a driver crossing bridge, bro.
We got to wrap this up.
Sell some paintings, man.
I mean, listen, I sell paint.
How much is the painting?
They're not even, they're inexpensive.
How much?
$2.95 and I ship it to you.
That's a deal.
Show us the gray, the gray purple biggie.
You'll be like that one.
The gray purple biggie, this one's pretty cool.
Hold on.
Oh my God.
This one?
No, the other gray and purple biggie.
That's a good, that's a good one.
That one's fire.
How long is this process of making one of these?
That's a fine arch degree right there.
Look, you even put the X on the edge of the painting.
It wraps the sides.
I got more, I got a few more.
I got like three more of these.
Not, I mean, they're, they're all different.
They're all different colors.
I want to picture a Trump with two stealth bombers
flying above his head as he's sitting on the fucking,
on the ninth hole of Mar-a-Lago.
I'm telling you, did you watch that video?
No, I couldn't find it.
I was looking through the fucking DMs.
I couldn't find it.
Unreal.
I want, I want like a fucking fish eye angle
of Trump holding his putter
on the green on the ninth hole of Mar-a-Lago.
You should put that scene in a movie.
Two stealth bombers over his head
and like a little, a little like caption quote,
that's power, baby.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Except it should be Trump and John Bailey.
I could do that with him holding,
yeah, holding the putter
and the planes going behind him up.
And, and, and do the, uh, uh, that's power, baby.
Yeah.
Did he say baby?
No, I don't, I don't know.
That's power.
That's power.
Try to find it and send it together.
That's perfect.
That's good.
You got to find it, bro.
Pull it up on there.
I can do that, I can do that like three foot by,
maybe three foot by, three foot by two foot.
Matt, have you seen that we created an Instagram group chat
between the three of us?
Have you seen it?
No.
Because we just pulled a little shit in there all the time
and you've never said anything.
Because he didn't, he just told me tonight.
You want to get a notification?
But it's been, it's been going for like six months.
We've been sending you shit for like months now.
We send shit all the time in a group chat.
You got to, you got to get in there and remember,
but I've never seen you respond.
That's because I didn't even know, because you know what?
So I have two Instagrams.
One's the pop art one, which I run.
No, we send it to the regular one.
Then you have the Instagram.com.
Right, that one, I don't respond to
because I've got a guy who takes care of that.
Well, how do we respond to you?
How do we get to the one that you'd look at?
I mean, the Cox Pop Art, that's my Instagram.
We got to add that account in there.
Yeah, because then I would get on.
It's called concrete, but spelled C-O-N.
What's your thing called?
Cox, C-O-X.
Cox, C-O-X.
Pop art.
Cox Pop Art.
I found it.
I found it.
Follow back.
All right, I'm on it.
All right, how do I add them to the...
There's a group chat.
All right, group chat.
Group chat, group chat, group chat.
I thought you were just ghosting us.
All right, can I add, how do I add them into this?
Go to...
We don't have to follow, I don't...
Yeah, that, click add.
You even follow you back.
I think I, don't I take all followers
if you just follow me?
Try adding them.
Is it the Luke's kid?
Cox Pop Art.
Add.
All right, you're added.
But he's probably not gonna see anything we already said.
That's it, got it.
Oh, no, no, I can see it.
I'm gonna remove Inside True Crime,
because fuck that one.
I got, oh, I, oh, look at what.
Can you see all the old stuff?
Are you serious?
Yeah, look, what's what?
What are you guys doing?
What is it?
I didn't see that one.
This is how we communicate all day, every day.
So you have to respond to us on that.
I didn't know any of this was happening.
Now you do.
Oh, there's Danny with his little boy.
Where?
That's your picture.
Oh, my profile picture.
Yeah, yeah.
Bro, what do you think about all this Joe Rogan
controversy going on?
They're trying to ban him.
Joe Rogan began right before the Spotify earnings report
causing problems for the CEO on the call
and contributing in part to the drop in its stock price.
Spotify officials say in the earnings call
that they did not expect their subscriber numbers
to be affected by the uproar over accusations
that Joe Rogan has spread misinformation about COVID
and the vaccines.
Misinformation.
Misinformation.
I bet you Chris doesn't think it's misinformation.
No, Chris.
No, Chris, Chris, Chris.
You should have had him going on the COVID.
The problem with COVID is that everything,
how could you say it's misinformation?
They changed the fucking, we don't know what's going on.
Everything changes every single month.
He's not pro vaccine.
Yeah.
Are you vaxxed?
Me?
Yeah.
Oh, man, let me tell you.
Okay, yeah.
So I had to go to Amsterdam, right?
And what happened was just before I went to Amsterdam,
like you either had to have the vaccine
or you'd take a test within 24 hours of getting on the plane.
So I went in and I got the vaccine.
You know?
But you had to have the vaccine 10 days prior to going.
And I got it on like day five.
And I didn't know that till I got it.
And then it was like, fuck.
So now I got it.
So then I went home when I went back when I saw her.
And I told her I got the vaccine.
Fuck it.
Which one did you get?
Johnson and Johnson?
Johnson and Johnson.
Oh, no.
She's like, yeah, you know which one.
Oh my gosh.
You're the fucked one.
You don't know what that is.
You don't know what's wrong.
That's the worst one.
I'm like, I'm fine.
It's going to be fine.
And she's like, now 15 years from now, when you end up, you know.
You're infertile now.
You're sterile.
Yeah, you didn't.
Stop.
You're sterile.
I'm 100 years old.
I'm probably infertile anyway.
So you know, nuts.
And then I ended up having to get tested anyway
within 24 hours of me getting on the plane anyway.
So you got it for no reason.
For no reason at all.
What's the whole vax controversy about, Matt Cox?
Me?
What's it boiled down to?
What is it?
What is it?
What's the whole stink about?
I mean, it's just that basically.
The whole vaccination controversy.
What's it all about?
They're trying to make you get something.
They're trying to make you get the vaccine,
even though getting the vaccine doesn't stop you from getting
the virus.
It makes it a little bit more difficult.
And then they're saying that because enough people don't get it,
the people that did get it are still getting the virus,
even though they're supposed to be protected.
Like, it's a halt to me.
It's just none of it makes sense, but whatever.
What's the point of it?
Why is the government pushing it so hard?
I don't know.
I'm sure that Chris will tell you they're putting
tracking devices in it.
What do you think?
That was going to ask you that.
I'm sure you're having a pity.
You've never even thought about it.
I mean, I've thought about it.
But I just don't care.
I just don't.
I just don't.
It's just the other thing.
You're not interested.
I just don't think I'm going to come up with the answer.
And it's not worth worrying about something that I can't control
and don't have the answer to.
And in the end, I don't know that it's, I don't.
I just, even if I knew the answer right now,
what would it change?
I could, what, go do a podcast and talk about it.
And then YouTube would shut me down immediately.
I could go on.
What could I do?
Yeah, but there's some people done.
There's some people on here who are listening to you
that respect what you say and think you have a valid opinion
and think that you're a thinking person.
What I think is, I think people value your opinion.
What are your thoughts?
Like if you actually had a, a took time to think about it,
what you would come up with.
There's people that actually value your opinion
and what you think about.
I mean, well, they're, they're, they're sorely mistaken
because I don't really have that much of an opinion.
And I don't think my opinion means that much anyway.
And I don't really, and it doesn't matter.
There's so much bad information out there.
Don't you think the government has our best interests in mind?
Like they really do care about our health
and they want us to be healthy and like they're,
they're not corrupt and they actually, you know.
There's a bat in a thousand.
They do care about us.
They don't lie.
I don't believe any of that.
Why?
I mean, I think that I'm sure there are decent people
in the government, but I also think that there are people
that are put in positions and they take advantage of
power, their power and their situation.
I'm, you know.
And Pfizer and those companies, those vaccine,
those are good companies, you know, with high moral standards.
He's trying not to get banned.
Right?
I mean, I mean.
He's getting brownie points on YouTube right now.
I, I, I think.
And, and the only reason that YouTube censors the people
that talk shit about them is because, you know,
we, they, YouTube cares about the health of the Americans.
And Danny just got another plaque.
Oh yeah.
It's in the mail.
It's in the mail right now.
I mean, I'm being serious.
I mean, I'm not a CIA shill, but.
Poor person.
Well, if you don't believe they have your best interest,
then you have to believe in some conspiracy theories.
Right?
I mean, I believe in some.
They're good.
The government is full and the CIA is full of good,
honest people.
No, you can't trust them.
You know what?
Once sometime, one time, what my grandpa said is he said,
if I wanted to watch somebody lie, I'd turn on the news.
Nice.
Yeah, I, I, I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't have the answer.
Do you, do you have the answers?
No, I'm just curious.
I'm asking you questions because this is my guest.
I don't, I don't have the answers.
Listen, man, I just, you know, I'm, I'm like everybody else.
I just want to watch some, some, some sitcoms
and eat some TV dinners and.
TV dinners?
Yeah, I do.
What kind of TV dinners?
Have you watched those arcs?
What do we eat?
Fuck those arcs.
Linguazine?
You eat the Linguazine?
A lovely Linguazine.
They're cheap.
They're like 350.
Wait, what do we get?
Oh man.
Just like they served us in, in the state feds.
Three for.
Chipotle closes in 20 minutes.
I'm fucked.
Three.
We, we ordered three.
We get, buy three, get one, three.
Or is it?
Yeah, it's like three.
They're like $3 in change and you get them.
And I, I love them.
I love them.
I've been eating them for like two years now.
Really?
Yeah.
How was it compared to prison food?
I mean, it's 10 times better than prison food.
Although I made one for Juan the other day and he was like,
are you guys living together now?
No.
And I was like, I was like, I was like,
that's pretty good, right?
Pretty good, right?
And he looked at it and he, he, he goes,
yeah, no, it's good, it's good.
I go, see, I told you, he goes,
what are you talking about, bro?
He goes, this sucks.
Because you're eating these twice a day.
And I went, yeah, he goes, it's horrible.
This is horrible.
Got all upset, but I think they're actually good.
I like them.
And they're low calorie.
No.
I'm concerned about my, concerned about my calorie.
Wait till you guys get to it.
Low calorie.
Shouldn't you be more worried about like sugar and carbs
than you should be worried about calories?
Bro, I eat a ton of sugar.
What about carbs?
Hey, he's going to Starbucks.
I think I'm moderate in carbs.
I try and eat as much protein as possible, but you know,
and I, and we work out, we work out at like,
I mean, I'd been getting better.
I was waking her up at like four o'clock,
three o'clock, four o'clock in the morning.
And but there was a lot of, a lot of.
For what?
To go work out at, be at the gym at five.
Three or four?
Yeah.
Well, I don't sleep, but maybe four or five hours
a night.
And so she gets upset because apparently she's
insisting that you need like six or eight hours
a night or something.
So I need at least seven.
That's nuts.
I could never sleep seven.
I can't, I can't function without seven to eight hours.
This morning I woke up at three, 30.
I woke up at three, 30.
I went to, we went to bed at like 11, 10, 30, like 10,
like 10, 30, 11.
I slept till three, I woke up at three, 30 in the morning,
laid there for about 10 minutes, went back to sleep,
woke up before 30, laid there for a little bit,
woke up at five, 30 and finally rolled out of bed
because I was like, I just, just can't.
That's like how my wife sleeps.
Yeah.
I can't sleep more than straight, maybe four hours straight.
Same thing with my wife.
Yeah.
My wife or like the same.
You and my wife are like very similar in a lot of ways.
That's odd.
This was an odd thing to say.
Yeah.
Let's, let's end it on that.
Yeah.
I'm not, I'm not even seeing that.
That guy you didn't reach over.
Because I sleep, I sleep fucking.
I don't wake up.
I fall asleep at 11 o'clock at night and I sleep uninterrupted.
I fucking snooze 11 to seven, 30 or eight.
Oh no.
I don't wake up once.
She wakes up every two hours.
I wake, I listen, I wake her up with coffee.
I go get her coffee.
I'm like, Hey, here's some coffee.
Come on.
Let's go.
We got to go to the gym and she's like,
Are you fucking serious about this?
I'm like, come on, let's go.
Let's go.
We're doing legs.
We're new legs.
We did.
Come on, come on, come on.
And she's like, are you really?
I'm like, come on.
I let you sleep in.
She just let me sleep in.
It's 5 30 in the morning.
I'm like, right.
I've been up since three.
Did you work out this morning?
Yeah.
What is your workout routine?
You do like a lot of cardio or do you just do a lot of weightlifting?
We're really just doing cardio because I'm doing,
I mean, we're really just doing weightlifting at this point
because I do cardio like pretty much every day at this point.
Because we just, huh?
What kind of cardio?
I mean,
I said sex.
I mean, that burns a lot of calories.
That burns a lot of calories.
That's the only cardio?
That's my only cardio.
But listen, trust me, you want to see my abs.
I mean, it's working, bro.
I need more than three minutes of cardio a day, man.
Stop, stop, stop.
That's not what's happening.
Lucky you.
So anyway, yeah, so we're just working out.
Congratulations.
We're working out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good.
I'm sure at some point in the diet item,
I'll have to start doing,
I'll start to start doing the elliptical again.
Yeah.
But your new hot yoga.
No, I don't even know what that is.
What's hot yoga?
It's yoga.
That's hot.
Yoga.
And it's basically yoga in a sauna.
You know what yoga is?
I mean, I know what yoga is.
Okay.
And they just turn the heat up.
It's like yoga in a sauna.
I don't do that.
But me just try.
I don't want to do yoga.
I definitely don't want to do it
without the air conditioning.
I don't want to do anything without air conditioning.
They turn the heat on.
I hate being outside.
You like, do you ever use a sauna?
I mean, I've been in a sauna like a long time ago.
I never really liked the sauna.
Why?
It's just very sweaty.
Yes.
And naked.
That is true.
That's just very, it just doesn't feel, it's just weird.
It's good for you.
I know, I know, I don't think so.
I disagree.
You disagree?
And I don't have anything to back that up.
I just feel disgusting.
He's not tall enough for that, right?
That was fucked up, bro.
That's very mean.
Take it back.
Take it back.
Very mean.
Take that back.
Take that back.
You're both mean peers.
Both of them.
That was him, not me.
Take that back.
Like that's the first time that's been said.
So yeah, I don't have anything to back it up.
But I just feel like they're just
disgusting saunas in general.
They're probably pretty unhygienic.
They're more sanitary than most things, I would think.
I'm not sure.
What other things?
Bro, the sauna's so hot, it probably burns up all of the bacteria
and parasites and shit.
They say that the sauna kills COVID.
They say COVID can't survive in that kind of heat.
Then why aren't all the hospitals filled with saunas?
Like, you got COVID?
Put them in the sauna, Jim!
You know, no.
I disagree.
Yeah, do people in really warm climates not get COVID?
Then how come you don't step into a sauna?
Really warm climates, bro.
The sauna is not so real.
Why aren't we all just having saunas?
Like, why didn't they just issue everybody's saunas?
That's too easy.
Why am I wearing a mask?
You can't make money off a sauna.
Bacteria can live in hotter and cooler temperatures
than humans.
But they do best in a warm, moist.
Sounds like a sauna.
Routine rich environment.
That sounds exactly like a sauna.
Google, does a sauna can COVID survive in a sauna?
It says it grows between $40 and $1.40.
Bullshit.
Can COVID survive in a sauna?
Google that.
$140?
Are saunas $140?
No.
Hell no.
Hell no.
I was going to say, okay, so if they can live-
No, they're close.
I think the saunas are typically like,
$110, maybe.
But bacteria lives up to $140?
It says it grows up.
It grows up.
What is the bacteria?
COVID is not a bacteria.
What is it?
COVID is a-
COVID is a virus.
A virus.
Yeah, so that's different.
So what kind of-
What's the max temperature for viruses?
Yeah.
Can sauna cure COVID if that's what I would say?
Bringing the sauna temperature to at least 160 degrees
throughout the space, including floria,
should be effective to disinfect any virus.
Including humans.
Who's going to live in 160?
Yeah, a buck 60.
Can I survive in 160 degree temperature?
How hot do saunas get?
You might as well-
Can you step in?
That's an oven.
That's how you slow roast some ribs in a buck 60.
That is like a Traeger.
You guys slow cook some ribs on a Traeger at 150.
I guess it'd probably take a good six, eight hours.
Maybe you're all right for 10 minutes.
Yeah.
You just cook yourself, bro.
I don't want to go into sauna.
Okay.
We go into sauna.
Do you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was in 100.
Couple times a week.
Really?
I spent probably a total of two and a half hours a week in a sauna.
That's a lot.
Two and a half hours a week.
Five times, 30 minutes a time, every time.
You ain't popping 30 minutes a day every day.
No, probably two, maybe two hours.
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm good.
I don't want to.
I'm not really a sauna person.
I'll let you go in there.
Unless I do the hot yoga.
You do hot yoga?
Yeah.
Why?
Because it's really good for you.
It feels fucking great.
I feel good.
I don't do hot yoga and I don't go to the saunas.
I feel great.
In pretty good shape.
You reach there, bro.
Yeah.
It's all mental.
It's all placebo.
What's the diet thing you're doing?
Are you still doing this?
No, I'm on regular diets.
Keto-Rama.
No, I try.
Yeah, I try it all kinds of crazy diets.
I fuck around with all the different types of diets.
What was the one we were starving yourself for like 12 hours a day?
No, I did it all fast.
Every year, I fast.
I don't eat for like seven days.
I do like a seven-day stint with no food.
Is that good?
He'll probably usually make it about four to seven.
I make it five, at least.
I've copped out, one time I copped out at four days.
One time I copped out at five days, and then one time I copped out at six days.
So I've actually never done the full seven.
I fast pretty much every day until I get hungry.
Yeah.
I mean, it says, yeah.
So, where does a guy work out at?
LA Fitness.
There's LA Fitness is still a thing.
Really?
There's LA Fitness.
It's in Wesley Chapel.
There's a guy who fasted for 380 days.
How's that possible?
What's that guy look like?
What's that guy look like?
He's all bones.
You can eat like beef, like bone broth, and you can drink water.
You don't eat, bro.
That dude, yeah, he's got to be all fucked up inside.
That's like, actually not really.
He is like probably one of the healthiest people in the fucking world.
That's how you can cure anything.
That's why they say a lot of animals, when they get sick,
they don't eat for a couple days.
Man Angus Barberry.
Somebody named that does some weird shit like this.
Fasted for 382 days.
Jim Jones doesn't do some stuff like this.
Look at that guy.
He did on tea, coffee, soda water, and vitamins.
Bro, the amount of fucking discipline it requires to not eat for five days is
un-fucking-godly.
Can we see a picture of this guy?
Is that the fat guy, the diet?
That's him?
I mean, if I had a better picture of this guy.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, what'd he look like after?
He was nothing but bone and ears.
It says he lost 265 pounds.
Click the picture.
Austin, you're really fucking shitting the bed today on Google.
Yeah, bro, can we see a picture of Austin?
You had a picture.
Austin's usually on it.
He had too much Man of Shabbos tonight.
That's before and after.
Whoa.
This is a long time ago, huh?
Whoa.
You know who Kelly Slater is?
He didn't look good, bro.
He didn't look good.
Do you know who Kelly Slater is?
No.
He lost a lot of weight.
Kelly Slater does seven-day fasts.
Slater.
It's good for you.
You know what it does?
So you know your digestive system, your stomach and your intestines.
Over a lifetime, over 20, 30, 40 years,
you build up this shit inside your gut that lines your intestines.
It's called a mucoid plaque.
And basically what it is, from decades of eating shit or eating food, whatever it is,
you develop this shit or food.
You develop a lining of just plaque, shit that comes from your food,
that lines your intestines, which inhibits your digestive tract's ability to absorb nutrients and
shit.
You should just take fiber?
Just like plummeting.
Bet a mucile.
Get rid of it?
No, no, no.
So what happens when you fast for that long is that shit starts to strip off the insides
of your gut and your intestines.
And that shit starts to come out of you.
So that's what prolonged fasting does, like three, four, five, six days does to you, 10 days.
And it's basically like, what do you use to clean out your plumbing shit?
Draino.
You know how your plumbing in your house gets coated with grime and you use draino?
This is like, fasting does the same thing.
Like it cleans out all the bullshit in your intestinal tract and your digestive tract.
And it enables you to absorb the nutrients from your food again.
It's crazy.
It's like a fucking, it's what fiber does too.
It cleans out your entire system too.
No, fiber doesn't clean you out.
Fiber just makes you shit.
I don't think it does it that well.
Yeah.
No.
Fiber.
To that extent.
Right.
This is like, this is like.
I'm going to look into fiber because I don't feel like not eating for seven days.
Right.
Of course you don't.
But that's why.
Well, you just said you didn't eat for like a month.
You already, you just did it fast.
Oh yeah.
You told me you went into depression fast for a month.
No, I didn't never said, I just wasn't eating very much.
I didn't say I didn't eat at all.
I just wasn't eating like I what looked like when I'm super happy.
I tend to eat more.
So when I'm depressed, I literally, I feel sick to my stomach.
I, you know, it was like heartbroken.
So I was, you know, it's pathetic.
Oh, stop.
All right.
So you went from two lean cuisines a day to one every two days.
No, it was like one a day and maybe a little bit of snacking and then just a lot more sleeping.
So I got like five hours sleep instead of four, you know, and just depressed.
It was just to probably just.
I don't think it's good for you to get four hours of sleep.
But I can't sleep any longer than that.
I mean, really, I'll just lay there.
I'm like, there's plenty of people do that.
Really?
Yeah.
You ever try Ambien?
No, I don't think Ambien is good.
Hey, you're taking an Ambien and just fought it and trying to stay awake.
No, I've never taken an Ambien.
Oh, you should try that one time.
I recommend.
No, and write a book.
I mean, I have to, I have to take it, piss test and stuff.
I mean, I'm not, I can't be experimenting with drugs.
Well, Danny said it would be okay.
You're on it.
Danny can come visit you because you said Stephen King did it.
So I mean, yeah, Stephen King did it.
All right.
Well, how long have we gone?
I don't know.
Where are we going?
I forgot.
It's 10 o'clock.
Let's end it.
Let's wrap this up.
We've been going to 730.
Or no, we started at 8.
We started at 8 o'clock.
