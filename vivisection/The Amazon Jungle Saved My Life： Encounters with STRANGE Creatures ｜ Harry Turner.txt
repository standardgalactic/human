your documentary is amazing it was I love the way you give a really unique
perspective on on the Amazon and what you guys you and that girl what was her
name again Sam yeah what you guys were doing down there rehabilitating those
animals and you know after talking to Paul Rosalie about the Amazon I had this
like really dark scary picture of that place and like what it was but after
watching yours it was like oh no this place is nice it's not that it's not
that scary it seems kind of fun yeah I don't know people kind of make their own
decisions on you know how it is and if you haven't been there it's kind of hard
to kind of read other people's kind of ideas of it like it is hard it is scary
it can be you know this mean and ferocious and vicious place you know
whether you're struggling with mental health or whether you're struggling
with Leishman ISS or dengue or malaria you know like any of these things that
can make the jungle awful but at the same time it can be one of the most
incredible experiences that you ever you know have and I remember being kind of
scared before I went down there I was I was like 20 coming on 21 when I first
went down there I kind of went down there for a reason of I went down there
to commit suicide and I ended up just like falling in love with the place but
you know prior to that I was thinking like damn like I don't know anything
about this place and you hear all these things about you know dangerous people
loggers minors all these things you know and you know and they are dangerous
don't get me wrong but like once you're there and you wake up to the howler
monkeys and the birds and you can kind of like I don't know bathe in the sunlight
through the canopy and just like you can close your eyes and be barefoot and just
feel so peaceful but at the same time you know it's a dangerous place and I
think that you know depending on who you speak to they'll tell you many many
different things but if you've spent a lot of time down there you'll find the
beauty in it 100% so we should let people know right up front about your
documentary Wildcat that won an Emmy that's correct yeah and what year did
that that movie got released what two years ago that's correct yeah so I had
been filming it for well to start off I didn't film anything for a documentary I
was just filming because I was young I was walking with these Wildcats I was
struggling with my mental health and I thought you know if I do make it out of
this place alive I want to have some memories to show potential children in
the future I want to have some footage to show my family when I get home if I
go home if I get home and I was filming all these things because I was like man
like I don't know anyone that's you know my age who I went to school with who's
doing this like this is just crazy and I was like writing down diaries of
everything that I'd done that day like you know I woke up at this time and I
went to you know check the boat and I went to go do this and you know then I
went out with the ocelot and then I you know caught a lizard and I fed this you
know lizard to him and I was just you know documenting whatever I could because
I was like this is really cool like nobody apart from me has ever reintroduced
an ocelot into the wild and documented it there could have been people you know
native people who have you know hunted an ocelot and they found the kittens and
they were like yeah whatever we'll just like raise it and let it go back out
into the wild but no one's ever documented it so I'm the first person in
the world to do that and so like of course I wanted to you know document it
and I just continued to do this and continued and continued and after years
and years and years of just collecting footage and collecting hard drives worth
of stuff had enough stuff to make a documentary and yeah and apparently
that was enough footage to to win an Emmy did a film crew ever come down and
and it's film with you guys I mean a lot of the footage is just self is like
self-shot right I could tell that you filmed I don't know what GoPro or
something like that but at what point did a film crew come down and start
following you guys around yeah so about 75% of the film is actually just filmed
by me and a film crew kind of came down after the first ocelot and there's
actually a previous guest of yours Paul Rosalie he introduced me to a guy
called Trevor and he was in that geo photographer and you know these things
and Paul was like show some stuff to Trevor and I was like you know what I
don't really I don't care like I'm this is my footage you know yeah what it is
yeah and then I basically was just like yeah okay all right I'll show you know
some footage and I showed him some stuff of like calm killing the caiman and all
these things and he was like this is really good like we need to make
something out of this you know for whatever reason we just need to do it
and and then yeah it was just like about a month after we were about to like plan
to do something the second ocelot came into my life and it was like send me
down a bunch of stuff and I'll film because I you know lived there for
years and years and the film crew would come down every now and again and they
would kind of get like snippets and they'll do update interviews and they
would do all these other bits and pieces that were important for the film but
they were never really like a hundred percent there you know they'd come
forward and backwards and they'd bring hard drives and we'd back things up
three or four times because humidity can kill anything in the jungle yeah and
yeah and then that's how we we got into making the documentary did you meet Paul
down there yeah so actually one of my first trips I was down there and he was
doing a tour with Tamandua and I was with another group called forna forever I
just you know gone down there to help for a month with reptiles and amphibian
surveys and I remember seeing this dude I didn't know who he was at the time and
he was just an absolute asshole and I was like oh my god who the fuck is this
dude like walking around with his top off like doing press-ups and like chin ups
in the trees and I was like well and he didn't say a single word to any of us I
think the only thing he like he like just dead-eyed stardust and it was because
there was a mix up between the two companies he was meant to do his tour
there we were meant to have moved out you know and I didn't know any of this I
was I just gone down there to volunteer so he was angry at the
organization but not individuals then when I went down there the second time
you know I'd had this epiphany my first trip there I was like I don't want to
die anymore I love this place this is really incredible I love the jungle
what can I do to help this so I went home I sold absolutely everything I
could my cut you know everything and came back and and basically that worked
and volunteered with this other group and I met Paul again during that and I was
like yeah I met you that first time he goes oh sorry I was such an asshole like
I didn't really mean to like I was mad at the organization I wasn't mad at you
guys and I was like yeah you know like is what it is and then yeah like for the
you know duration of my time on last p address I you know I would see him quite
regularly that's amazing yeah so going back to the first time you went down
there what can you explain like what was going on in your life like before you
decided to go down there and what were you like what made you want to join the
military and how did that all play out yeah so I I was born into a military
household my dad was in the Navy he was a chief pay officer he served 12 years
and so you know I was always bouncing about from you know place to place
barrack to barrack and I guess that was just kind of like installed into me my
great uncles were in the military my granddad was in the fire service so
everyone has always been you know kind of lever like a first responder or a
military person and my dad had come in like my dad's very like he's not
disciplined like to a point of where it's like you know scary but he's like
disciplined to the point of where it's like you don't want to like do anything
wrong or you don't want to like you know cross boundaries with him because you
know you've got to be respectful that this is his house and I'm living under
it rent-free and you know all these things and so I was sat on my bed one
day like listening to some music and my dad came in and he was like you're gonna
be 18 soon like what you know what are you gonna do with your life and I was
like I don't know you know at this point I'm just skateboarding smoking weed and
working at like some restaurants you know I'm just like earning a little bit of
cash here and there just to pay for some weed and and some skate trips and
and that's about it that's about enough and he was like I'm not like joking
about here but like why don't you join the Navy and I was like I'm not gay I'm not
joining the Navy I'm not gonna be like stuck on a submarine with like so many
blokes with nowhere to go I was like you've done that like you know we had a
laugh about it and we joked about it and he was like but no in all seriousness
like I didn't know what to do when I was younger so and you know my dad spent a
while actually trying to get into the Navy he kept failing some of his tests
because he wasn't you know like clever enough or smart enough to like pass these
like initial first tests what you have to pass to get into becoming an officer
right and and yeah and he was like well just think about it and I was like okay
so I'm a mummer's boy right I didn't really listen to my dad much but I'm
going to speak to my mum so afterwards I was like mum like dad spoke to me about
this I don't want to and she's like you don't have to do that like that's fine
you you can you know do whatever you want but like it's a it's a it's a route
that you could go and it doesn't have to be the Navy you could join the Air
Force you can join the Army like whatever Marines you can do whatever so I
thought about it and I was like do you mind coming with me to like take me to
the Army kind of like sign up place and just like talk to them because I'm no
I'm good at a few things I'm good at being on time I'm good at running and I'm
good at just being like this person which you know just is adventurous when
I was younger I used to like run away from home to like climb trees and like you
know there's not much to do in England but I would always find a way to get
outside I always find a way to go to the local park and find snakes and find
frogs and you know I caught this like crazy spider which wasn't you know not
meant to be in the area and all these things I always do this research and my
grandparents were always kind of like recording things on VHS for me and I'd
like go around and watch like Komodo dragons in like Indonesia and I was like
driven to be outside you know and I was like if I do join the Army maybe I'll
spend way more time outside and I'll get paid for it so I went to the
recruitment center I spoke to them you know they want to recruit anyone I looked
like I was you know 12 years old and they're like yeah yeah yeah you know like
it's perfect you know child labor basically so I was 17 at the time what
year was it this was in 2010 okay 2000 and yeah 2010 2011 and they said you
got to do this barb test then you got to go do these you know physical tests and
then you know we will you know see what you're able to do and you can go off and
do whatever you want so I did the barb test and I honest that like out of a
hundred and something jobs I could have done like 85 of them you know and I
hated school I hated any of that I was never good at any of them things so for
me to be like way above board on all these things I was like damn like I
actually could be good at this like this is this is crazy there was dog trainer
there was you know medic there you know all these things mechanic obviously I
chose infantry because I was naive to the fact that you know war was this
horrible you know I just naive I was 17 I did all my tests I turned 18 two days
later I went to cataract ITC cataract which is up north in England and I
spent six months doing basic training there it was some of the most brutal
training I've ever done you know and I was young and I was fit and I could do
all these things but the intensity and the mental break you down to build you
up again and the you know everything that was going on it was absolutely brutal
like I could definitely do it again don't get me wrong but it was mentally so
taxing it was really really hard what kind of stuff that the guys that they
have you doing it was you know up at five in the morning going to bed at like
one o'clock every night you would you know make everything as neat as possible
you would do your bed they would come in at like six in the morning and
absolutely just trash everything like every day and if some if someone was
you know doing something wrong they would stand there and we would get
completely beasted like it would be like two in the morning will be running
hills in in like minus two you know Celsius and it was like it was like just
six months of just horrible brutal shit and I was I you know I did my passing
out parade I'd you know completed it I was I won an award actually for best
fitness because I even though I was small even though like I'm not a big
person I have this like drive in me to just be the best that I can when I'm
like doing something physical and I got to a point of where they realize how
good I was at running and how good I was at carrying like my own weight and
running that I would be the one in charge of the person that was slow at
the at the back and I would have to carry them with their weight and my weight
and I'd have to run and I would do miles and miles like carrying these people and
it it was physically very very demanding passed out I did my you know six
months I did all that and I you know I was going to my battalion and when I got
to my battalion I I just saw these buses leaving and I was like what where is
everybody well they were already on their way to Afghanistan and I couldn't go to
Afghanistan yet because I had to do like a weeks or two weeks worth of like
desert training so I had done all this training in for the six months in in in
in a my recruitment but that was for like cold warfare I then had to do all
this training of like you know sweeping for you know IEDs and all these
different things in like a hotter setting in my mind so I did two weeks of that
and then they flew me to Afghanistan so now this is I mean forgive me because I
don't know the names of all the different divisions of military in England so
look what is it what is the proper name of the division of the military that
you're in well I was in the the British infantry the Royal Anglian regiment
okay and so I yeah I had you know completed my training which was a
training of basically a whole variety of different things to then go to my
battalion and the battalion was the one which was my infantry regiment and
that's the one I was gonna be serving with really so how many how many English
troops were in Afghanistan throughout the years I couldn't tell you there was a
lot though really I see when I always thought about those wars I always thought
it was just American troops that I didn't realize that a bunch of our allies
sent boots on the ground there too I maybe I'm just I worked with American
soldiers on the ground so I actually went to Afghanistan as a battle casualty
replacement so I went to fill the boots of someone who was either injured or
dead and when I went there I was this 18 year old boy one of the youngest to
ever go to Afghanistan and I was there dropped off in the middle of nowhere
basically as a battle casualty replacement to then just join this you
know family of brothers I didn't know a single one of them because I had my
military training ended as they were leaving so I didn't know who I was meant
who was gonna have my back they didn't know if I was gonna have their back they
had no idea who I was I was this like black sheep like I was this outcast and
it was as an 18 year old kid going to Afghanistan one not knowing if you're
ever gonna see your family again and then to joining this you know brotherhood
but you're not a brother was was that was hard and then within the first five
days I saw someone get shot in the head and I was just like what am I doing here
like I I was holding this guy's hand and I was just like talking to him and he
was an Afghani soldier but he was working with us as like translator holding
his hand and I was like are you okay like and he was talking to me but you
could you I couldn't even like replicate it because it was just mumble
like he was dead but he was still living his brain was completely gone
because he'd been shot in the head but he was still holding my hand and he was
still trying to talk to me and he was still alive but I knew that is he wasn't
there his soul was leaving and I just remember kind of like sitting back and
being like what am I doing here why did I I had your 18 I had all of these jobs
that I could have chose and I chose infantry why did I choose infantry and I
just remember like I went to the bathrooms like there was these big
shower blocks and they're basically like who's shipping containers I remember
going in there and sitting on the toilet and it just stinks of shit and it's
just like so hot in there because it's like it's hot it was you know in
Fahrenheit I think it was like 110 115 that was outside inside the shipping
container is even hotter and so I'm sitting there just dripping with sweat
but I'd just seen someone die you know and I was just like I couldn't I couldn't
like place myself I was just like what like what am I doing here I just remember
sitting there thinking like my friends are at home just having beers and
chilling out you know it's like why am I here you know I couldn't I couldn't
figure out what led me to this point and then I did another you know so my tour
was six months long I then you know I saw some horrible stuff and what kind of
things were you doing like what kind of what were your tasks yeah so I work with
the Afghan National Police and Afghan National Army and my job there was to
teach these people how to run their police and army better so that when the
British and the US troops left Afghanistan they were able to kind of like do
their job without the assistance of you know us obviously that didn't really
work and it's sad you know because like I I was training these troops to you know
do these different do these different things which were going to help their
country and at one point I was doing like weapons training and we had AK-47s and
we're on the range this guy turns around points the AK right on my head and starts
talking and the translators like whoa whoa like calm down and you know I was
just like I'm dead I'm gonna die and what had happened is they had recruited
someone who was Taliban and so we're training these people how to run their
army and police but we're training the enemy so now the enemy knows all of the
freaking tactics that we're meant to be training them it was chaos how did what
and he pointed the gun at your head then what happened translator kind of told you
know hey like he has nothing to do as well I don't know what they said because
you know they were talking in different tongue and I I was just like once
again what the fuck am I doing here like I'm 18 years old I am being put in
situations which are just chaos nobody knew what they were doing nobody was
doing anything correctly we were going out there was casualties all the time
that there was you know and it was collateral damage it was people doing
things and you know you know innocent people it exactly I can't tell you the
amount of dead children I saw and that is one of the things which haunts me the
most and it's the one of the things which caused me to have the most severe
PTSD that I've ever been through and it's the reason why I went to the jungle
to commit suicide is because I couldn't face the fact that I had been a part of
a huge genocide even though you know I didn't even though I didn't kill
thousands and thousands of people I was part of that I was part of the British
Army and I was working with the US Army and I was doing horrible things to
potentially try and make this country better and I've spoken to people in you
know different countries I've spoken to Afghanis I've spoken to a lot of people
and there's actually operation called Operation Snow Leopard that you know I've helped
volunteer with and they bring Afghan nationals to the US who are seeking you
know a better life this last year I think I spent like $600 on this family who came
over and they had nothing I went and bought them all brand new clothes they
had a brand new baby I bought them brand new baby clothes because they had
nothing and I I think it's survivors guilt I really do but I wanted to do
something to help them and when I spoke to him I said look I'm gonna be straight
up and honest with you right now I went to Afghanistan and I was in Op-Hyric 16
you know in 2012 and the Afghani man said to me he was like it's not
your fault you were there trying to do your job but our country was not able to
accept the help and that made me feel a lot better you know because he knew that
that his country was messing up this opportunity to seek help but then again
if you look at it on the other hand like I don't judge anybody really but you
look at it on the other hand if a country came over to my country whether
it be you know in the UK where I used to live or the US now where I live mm-hmm
and they were driving tanks through you know through places they killed my
uncle you know they done all these horrible things like you probably be
putting bombs on bridges too right exactly oh I would be mad if someone
killed my uncle or someone killed my mom or dad or you know my sister or you
know I'm not saying that the US or the UK military did that but I'm what I'm
saying is that they there has been bad people and there has been bad things
happen in the British and the US military overseas mm-hmm this episode of the
podcast is brought to you by Verso have you ever tried fasting or intermittent
fasting if so you may be aware of the sizzling energy and mental clarity that
you get if you do it long enough the scientific data validating the health
benefits from fasting for weight loss is overwhelming but what doesn't get
talked about enough is the longevity benefits you get from fasting when you
fast your body turns on all its defense mechanisms to help your body hunker down
to fight off illness and disease but the problem is it takes three days of
starving yourself to activate this process scientists like David Sinclair
have recently discovered molecules to help your body turn on this process
without having to fast if you've ever heard this podcast before you've heard
me talk about Verso many times and I've had world-renowned nutritional
scientists like Dominic D'Agostino on the show who is the guy who actually
introduced me to Verso and I've been taking it every day for the last three
years cell being is always the first thing I take in the morning after dragging
my carcass into the kitchen which wakes me up and gives me energy I even use it
for pre-workout and clean being is the product I use every night before bed
after taking clean being for some time now I have actually noticed a huge
improvement in not only my hormone regulation but my vision has improved I
know it sounds insane but this stuff actually can improve your vision my
lipid regulation has gotten better and another huge thing is all of a sudden I
don't get affected by all the pollen in the air I don't have any of these
reactions and clean being has actually been scientifically proven to alleviate
these things other clinical trials have proven healthier skin less inflammation
healthier hair lipid regulation enhanced cognitive function and improved
metabolism on top of that Verso always publishes third-party testing on each

would be horrible I'd be I'd be mad you know I would be for sure innocent
people died yes for sure people lost their loved ones yes and kids lost both
their parents and what happens to those kids when they grow up like how what is
their view on America and what is their view on the UK after they come after
this huge army comes in with all these tanks and airplanes and weapons and your
fucking family dies now you're all alone and it's not just over the last you know
20 30 years this is over centuries you know the British army were there and you
know I can't remember the exact dates but they were there hundreds of years ago
I was actually in a it was a it was a forward operating base called
short cap and there were like these you know it's this really cool place you
know 400 you know people could live there and they had in the center like
this huge rockery it was this huge you know mound of rocks and it was really
cool and inside you know there was these caves and the bats every night would
come flying out of it and I'd love you know if I wasn't on duty I would sit
there you know and just watch the bats and the birds fly in and out of them
caves and I remember thinking like that cave isn't natural like what where is
that cave from and I went and spoke to somebody and they said yeah like back in
the day the British military came here and they'd use these places to sleep at
night and I was like well you know being 18 as well I had no idea that they were
there hundreds of years ago but they were there killing innocent people again
and it's like if you are brought up in a in a country where foreigners have come
over and they have killed your family and killed your loved ones and cause you
madness are you gonna love them and you're gonna respect them and are you
gonna if you can get into their kind of like Afghan National Army and police and
try and you know yeah it's got to make it hard to progress and develop as a
culture in a society when that keeps happening yeah to you yeah definitely
yeah and I left Afghanistan and I just remember thinking that I had failed in
what I'd set out to do and I didn't set out to do anything really I'd set out to
go and serve my country and I'd set out to try and change another country I've
always seen the world is this like did you ever feel any sense of any sense of
purpose or mission when you were there or did you just kind of feel like you
never really got your never really figured out like did you did you ever
feel like you were a part of that group or that brotherhood when you when you
finally got there and spent some time there and did you ever have any kind of
like drive or motivation to get this done or you know get this mission
completed and save these people or whatever it might be or was it all just
kind of like a whirlwind of you questioning everything feel is as a
hard word because I honestly don't think I felt anything when I was there I
didn't cry the whole time I was there even after seeing you know people die
and missing family and all the and not knowing if I was ever gonna make it I
didn't cry once I did feel like I became part of the brotherhood because after
some time after some time you know you're spending every single day with
with one another you're seeing you're seeing guys 24-7 you're you're walking
with them 24-7 you're making sure that they've got water you're making sure
they've eaten you're making sure they're alright you're making sure they're
showering I had this one that dude that slept next to me fucking stunk the guy
just never no he was a British guy nasty dude but he he stunk and I was like
look I'm not gonna I'm not gonna like I don't know what you're going through
you've already he'd already done a tour as well he'd done one tour before me as
well so I can't judge him I don't know what he's dealing with but I was like
look dude you are making this fucking tense stink and we need to be hygienic
in this place like this is one of the this is our safe space when we're out
there you can stink all you want but when you're in here we need to be clean we
need so after I kind of like put across like I'm not this guy that's just gonna
come in and be a burden I'm good I'm this guy that's gonna come in and yeah I do
look innocent but I've got a head on my shoulders I'm gonna try help you out where
I can I'm not saying I didn't fuck I fucked up a few times you know but I was 18
it's trial and error I'm in a new country I'm in a new place I don't know what
I'm doing I'd spent the last six months of my 18 years you know of life learning
a different terrain and then I come to this desert and I'm like what am I doing
you know this is crazy and I think the the reason why my PTSD really really
hit was because during my 18th birthday and you know doing my tour and all of
these different things and turning 19 and and doing I didn't stop for a minute
I was constantly on the go constantly like I'd I'd celebrate my 18th I got
absolutely obliterated I went to train in I did my six months of training I went
to my battalion they did two weeks I went to Afghanistan I did six months I
went to my barracks afterwards and then you know we had R&R and we were just
like rest and recovery and we didn't do anything we stopped and then when it was
like you know get on parade you know we're all dressed up and we're you know
we're in a parade and yeah we don't have anything for you today so just go back
to your rooms play your PlayStation I'm not a gamer I'm not all these types of
things you know so I went back to my room and I just sat there and I was like
what like how am I meant to process what I've just done for the last 18 months
when I'm just you know not doing anything I started drinking heavily I'd
wake up and drink vodka I'd go to bed drink what you know like I was drinking
heavily because I didn't know how to deal with it I hadn't been taught how to
deal with it I was struggling with the things that I had done as struggling
with the things that I was battling in my own head and I then got medically
discharged they said it was recurrent depression I went to a specialist after
I actually got discharged and they were like no I've seen this time and time and
time again you have PTSD but if the military discharge you with PTSD they
have to pay you out if they discharge you with recurrent depression they
don't have to pay you any money and so I was like okay like the British Army is
just you know fuck me over again pull the old one too on you yeah and I just I
was just lost I was so lost how many guys that you were with down there really
wanted to be there and how many of them were kind of like you it's a good
question I think I'm of a I'm a very sensitive human so not many people were
like me I would say there was a lot of people that wanted to be there there
was a lot of people that wanted to kill mm-hmm there was a lot of messed up
humans that younger guys or older guys or what they you know they couldn't be
any younger than me so they were all within you know the 18 to 25 to you
know that around 18 to 30 age range mm-hmm I had one guy who he he was like in
his late four weeks but he was kind of a reserve and he was like the dad of the
group he was this you know Tom Fleming his name was an absolute legend I just
love that guy he was the rock of the group and the rest of them they either
didn't know why they were there or they wanted to do damage and I was having
this conversation the other day when you are taught the these people who dress
this way who look this way who have this facial hair who speak this language
these are the enemy when you are taught that from training and you're taught
that and you're taught that and even when you're in Afghanistan and you're with
interpreters and you're with these people who are the you know same they have
their facial hair they pray they do all these different things they have this
religion and you're taught these are the enemy these are the enemy you got to
kill them you and no offense to anybody who you work with those guys right like
you guys are working side-by-side with the Afghan army right right and no
offense to anybody who is listening to this but when you're like being told
kill these fucking and you know kill these fucking and all these things
something inside you is like why why are they telling me to do that like what
what have these people done wrong but then you're like oh shit someone's gonna
someone's shooting at me kill these you know and it's a hot it's dude it makes
me sick it's horrible like you you're brainwashed to do these things and that
brainwashing really really took a toll on me and yeah I was about ready to kill
myself I was done I didn't want to be on this planet I didn't want to be
surrounded by people who were as sick as that I didn't want to be kept with the
memories of dead children and dead people that I'd held hands with I just how
often did you think about that stuff every day every day you just couldn't
escape that's why I started drinking so heavily I I haven't really told anybody
this but I had this reoccur in nightmare and sorry it was me walking into this
like mud hut and there was like this state of the oven and the light was on
and I and I would go over to the oven and I would try and open the door but I
couldn't open the oven door and I would just see this kid screaming inside and
he would put his feet up against the glass and the feet skin would just melt
to the glass of the oven and I would wake up just screaming
and like I had that dream all the time and it's because I saw so many dead
kids and how's an 18 year old mind you know like you're not even fully
developed how how am I meant to go through life just seeing that hate you
know it's just yeah yeah it's just horrible and so I didn't want to be here
I was done I just but I just wanted to die I went but the thing is I I was so
set on dying I went to the jungle to kill myself but the reason why I went
there was because I didn't want my little brother at the time to see his
younger brother dead I didn't want to put my brother through what I'd gone
through I wanted my my death to be a mystery or I wanted my death to look
like an accident and I went to the jungle after being medically discharged
from from the military and for every single day I woke up and I said today's
a day you're gonna kill yourself it's gonna be a venomous snake bite it's
gonna be a fallen tree you know it's gonna be getting lost in the jungle go
cut your wrist somewhere drown whatever just get whatever presents itself it's
gonna it's gonna be the day you wanted to you wanted to be by the you wanted
like the wildlife to take you I wanted my death to look like an accident and I
thought the Peruvian Amazon would be the best place for that and well the
Amazon but when I was doing my research online I just found this one place that
was you know working in Peru and it just so happened to be Las Piedras the river
that Paul would worked on the river that I'd spent time with on and with
Andrew Eucles you know that first initial place I had no idea what this
river was gonna do to transform my life but I went there and I said to myself
every single day today's a day you're gonna kill yourself today's a day and no
joke and and and you know I'll get on to this topic in a little bit about my
nonprofit and what I want to do with veterans but the jungle had a way after
14 days of telling me don't do this don't kill yourself you don't you belong
here you still have you know light at the end of the day you have to be here
and I was sat on the front of the boat and the birds were changing with the
bats and I just you know it's just this beautiful memory that I have and my
feet were hanging over the front of the boat and we'd just been fishing so you
know we caught dinner and I just remember just smiling and I was just so happy
dude and I was like don't kill yourself man you've got so much to live for you
have family at home you have jungles to protect you have animals that you've not
yet seen that you're gonna see you have all these things I remember going back
and I remember like writing in my diary like you know today's a day that things
are gonna change took two weeks of me not being on my phone not being
surrounded by internet there's no internet there's no nothing solely being
in nature that saved my life two weeks was all it took for me personally to
then realize I I don't need to end my life today and it's a crazy feeling
absolutely crazy like I can't even like express that gratitude that I had for the
jungle at the time you know and I just remember like that night I got back and
I ate this piranha that I'd caught and I went out on a night walk and I saw the
you know I saw all these incredible animals and I'm talking like night
mammals like kinkajoo tape here you know you know you can see these tracks and
you can smell these things and do like everything before that was gray everything
before that was just stagnant static like horrible and as soon as I had that
kind of uplift in my spirit the greens were greener the sounds of all my more
vibrant the I could smell again I could taste food like I could do all of these
things that I thought that had just gone and it's just and don't get me wrong I
wasn't cured I wasn't healed I wasn't by any means you know healthier physically
you know or mentally but something had changed in that moment and I was like
something is alive in me that would that had died there was maybe an ember left
in me and now that ember has become a fire again you know and yeah dude I can't
tell you what it feels like to be so down and then to feel so lifted wow two
weeks man what up what like what were some of the other big changes you noticed
in yourself just because just being exposed to while the nature and being
completely cut off from technology having your life drastically the first
thing was that I was able to wake up I was able to go to bed and I was able to
wake up beforehand I would lay in bed not be able to sleep and then when it was
time to get up I would be this zombie I couldn't I couldn't the energy that it
took to get my head off of the pillow and to take myself out of the duvet and to
get up and go for a piss like mm-hmm it would be like the type you know when
you're in bed and you've just gone to the toilet but you need to go again and
you're like damn I really need to go to toilet but like I don't want to get up
it would be that for hours but I wouldn't even need to go to the toilet I
would just be like I need to get up but I can't just can't I had no appetite so
when I became a little bit kind of like more mentally strong I started eating a
little bit more and by the way at this point I'd stop drinking I detox in the
Amazon no it was before that kind of jumping forwards and backwards here but
before I went to the jungle I had this horrible experience where I was drinking
and drinking and drinking and drinking and I was at this house party and
everyone was doing coke and everyone was just getting absolutely a bit red and
I never really touched drugs you know so I was like I'm staying away from the
drugs but I'm just gonna get absolutely blacked out drunk and I remember just
like seeing all of these people doing everything and then just feeling so ill
inside and I was just drinking and drinking and drinking and I got to a
point where I was like fuck this I'm leaving and I went outside and I fucking
I had this brand new car that I'd bought from like from Afghanistan money and I
was just punching the shit out of my car and I walked off and the girl I was
seeing at the time noticed that I wasn't at the party and I'm like blacked out
drunk walking up a you know kind of like a highway and I hear someone running up
behind me and as soon as she grabs me I didn't know it was her you know I'm
still struggling with my mental health I turn around and I I I'm about to fucking
knock her out mm-hmm didn't know who it was I was just in my mind it was fight or
flight and I'm not flying at any moment I'm fighting like this is the anger that's
in me is that I didn't have any flight it was just stand your ground and fucking
throw fists I turn around and I go a puncher and I instantly realized who it
was and I just whoa like it was this this weird moment of sobriety I just
instantly got sober and I was like oh man I almost hit you like I'm really
sorry like and she's like drunk as shit and she's like why did you punch your
car I almost got hit by a car on the way here cuz I crossed the road and I'm
like I don't give a fuck if you almost got hit by a car I need some time I need
some space please leave me alone and an um awful awful night it was just toxic
and horrible and then the next day I went to a guy who a guy's house for a
barbecue who I'd been in the military with and he froze me a beer and I
open it up and it just and I'm like oh my fucking god that stinks and I was I
just it didn't smell like beer it's smell like toxic you know and I just put it I
just gave it to him and I was like it was a rough night last night you know I
didn't know what was what's happening but I was like it's a rough night last
night I'm just gonna drink water today and he wasn't the type of military
person that was like now just get fucking drunk he was like okay I
understand you know and it just smelled like regret and it was it was at that
point where I was like I'm gonna stop drinking that was a 7th for July and so
this this July I'll be 11 years sober not a drop of alcohol did you ever talk
to your parents or your dad particularly about any of this stuff and any of these
feelings that you're having afterwards no but they knew something was up mm-hmm
yeah I am they know now my dad kind of wrote me a letter and kind of spoke to
me a little bit and you know obviously after seeing the documentary he was like
oh missed out on that but um he he's he kind of blames himself for a lot of
stuff when I was younger we would always go running and he would make me do
these like military obstacle courses and he was like I blame myself for you
joining the army I blame myself for not seeing how mentally unwell you were I
blame myself for you know all these things he's like I should have seen it
when you started selling your car and when you started you know selling your
shoes to leave like I should have seen that you wanted to die but I guess I
just didn't want to see it hmm he knew he knew deep down that I was unhappy and
I didn't want to be on this planet but he didn't want to believe it who does who
wants to have a child and you know have them for right a long time you know 19
20 years is a long time and then who wants to see their child die you know
no one want they want they want the best for their kid especially my parents my
parents are incredible I don't don't tell that to them enough actually but my
parents are incredible and I love them to pieces and I guess I didn't have a lot
of support from them but the support that they showed me growing up gave me
the strength to really know that I had support from them you know it's just
yeah yeah so when you were down in the Amazon what kind of animals were you
rescuing at first or like what sort of things were you guys doing down there a
part as a part of that group yeah so when I first went down there I was just
kind of like catching snakes and frogs and you know measuring them and you know
checking temperatures of like the environments and stuff and they it was
just like a very kind of like small thing I wasn't rescuing anything at the
time and you know after a few years of being down there it was just kind of
like I was doing transects and I was working with tourism and I was you know
just being there I didn't so was it like a job or were you kind of just like
volunteering I had no money I had no nothing I was just there because I
didn't have anywhere else to go and they fed you and stuff and gave you a place
to sleep and yeah I just kind of like did your thing kind of dust about from
like organization to organization and they were like yeah as long as you kind of
cut trails and you guide for us like you can stay here and we'll feed you and
stuff like that I was like cool like I don't have anything else you know so
then I then I started working for the organization that is featured in the
documentary don't want to talk too much about them because they are not very nice
people or company but I then was just kind of like doing the same old you know
doing tour stuff doing you know bits and pieces here there and and then one day
this this worker messaged me and was like there's a an ocelot which is in the
local community just upriver and I was like huh okay so like I you know I was
there and I went over and spent spent like seven hours trying to convince
these people that this cat would be you know better off in in my care and they
were like give me like $200 and I was like I'm not giving you any money like
they're like yeah but you know we we took this animal and this is our animal we
fed it for the past few days and you know like they were you know taking it to
the town so they could sell it to the black market and someone from you know
these were like indigenous people or yeah they were native Peruvians and what
they do is when they go and cut down trees they get pennies for that nothing
you know because the companies get paid when they sell it to the US or to China
you know they the people that are cutting down the trees don't make the poor
people yeah right but when they cut down a tree these trees are the life to so
many animals these trees from the root systems the mycelium the the insects you
know the invertebrates that use it the bird life the snake life the mammalian
life anything you know these trees are life and in the film Avatar it makes it
very very apparent that these trees really do connect to absolutely everything
very underrated film actually but I I saw this time and time again where people
would go out and they would be logging and they would just kill mother howler
monkeys so they could eat the meat but then they would also keep the baby and
they would sell the baby and they would sell the baby sometimes for even more
money than they would make from the tree wow so when you've gone ocelot and you
kill the mother or you cut down a tree and you find two cubs in in the in the
tree you eat the mum if you've killed her which is you know horrible to me take
the Pelt sell the Pelt for money have the kittens sell the kittens for money
and you've made three times what you would from cutting down an endangered
species of tree and so I was trying to you know have this broken Spanish
conversation with these people this cat is going to be better off you know here
and they like pay me and I'm like no but what I will do is I'll buy you dinner
because you've paid money for the milk and you've paid money for the rice and
you know gasoline and after a while of shotguns and machete conversations and
you know I did I was like my dad definitely kind of like called this one
before I left one time he was like so if you do get abducted you know what
should the ransom be and I'm like dad just let it be if I die I die but you
know he called it he he knew that I was going to be putting myself in danger for
the safety and security of this this forest and the animals that call it
home and I remember taking the ocelot for about seven hour conversation and a
dinner date and when it slept in my hammock and I just put him on my
shoulder and he not felt that love since he'd been taken from his mom you know
he'd not he'd been kept in a box he'd had a string wrap around his neck you
know and he was just this absolutely beautiful creature and as soon as he
felt my heart to his you know body and as soon as he felt at the time I hadn't
had a haircut for God knows how many months so soon as he felt my hair and
he just snuggled into my hair and he could feel my heart beat through my
neck there was a connection instantly it was this I remember sitting there like
laying there sorry in my hammock and it was getting pretty cold it was like four
in the morning but I was getting up every hour to you know feed him milk this
episode of the podcast is brought to you by PXG when PXG says nobody makes golf
clubs the way they do they're not lying my personal experience with buying golf
clubs and using different brands of golf clubs is I always thought the more
expensive golf clubs were the better the quality but my new set of PXG's has
blown that perception out of the water and when I heard about their new black
ops driver the driver that promises you don't have to sacrifice distance for
forgiveness I absolutely had to try it last weekend PXG invited me out to one
of the high-end golf courses out in Tampa so I could get a custom fitting
with their new black ops driver and it was incredible one of their golf pros
spent an hour with me helping me dial in all the little measurements and all the
little tweaks in the golf club to make sure that I had the perfect fit for my
driver this PXG black ops driver is a breakthrough in driver technology it's
a complete and total victory in golf club engineering something like you've
never seen before black ops drivers are adjustable to deliver a combined MOI of
10,000 plus for unreal forgiveness that's ridiculously high and the higher the
MOI the more forgiving the club will play meaning you don't have to square the
ball perfectly for it to go straight and to get distance add PXG's new advanced
material face technology and you get incredible ball speed that pushes
distance to the absolute limits that's more forgiveness more distance and no
sacrifices the term game changer has been thrown around so much that it's
lost its meaning but trust me when I tell you the PXG driver is a true game

back to the show and I remember thinking this guy is a survivor he's gonna
survive and I'd you know I don't know what the plan is for him I was thinking
that maybe I'll take him and I know somebody who knows somebody who knows
something about reintroduction and they can do this or I didn't want him to go
to a zoo I didn't want him to go to any other kind of like facility where he was
just gonna be like a sperm donor or it was just gonna be like a piece of
entertainment that was he was gonna go back into the world and I didn't know
how it was gonna be done but I knew in my heart that I was gonna be the one
that was gonna help this situation and I remember thinking there and I was
thinking I don't like boxing you know I like fighting and stuff like that but
I'm not a big boxing fan but there was this like thought in my head of like
Amir Khan he's like a British boxer and I was just thinking like Khan like Khan
is such a good name for him like he's a fighter he's small he scrawny you know
like and Amir Khan isn't like huge and then I was thinking like you know Khan
from the Jungle Book and I was thinking and I was like this is him this and he
was just and for the next um yeah the next close to a year I just spent every
single day with him every single minute you know I was with him side by side
hunting killing fighting I how did you know like the ways to train him to catch
food and like the types of animals to train him to hunt and like what time of
day like to bring him out and walk him through the woods like it seems like you
were doing it every night you would take him on night walks like how did you know
all this stuff I knew the Ocelots primarily one Octurnal and it was you
know when when you have cats and you've got if you have a cat home you know that
at night time them cats are gonna be going crazy most cats use the day to
rest and kind of do a few bits and pieces and they use the night to really
kind of like utilize that the reason why I have such big eyes the reason why
Ocelots actually have white around their eyes is so it absorbs more moonlight so
that they can see even clearer than an animal which just has dark around its
eyes I didn't know what I was doing but I can say this for a lot of people as
well is that when you spend a lot of time in nature things become natural and I
didn't know specific details I just knew what felt right and I knew that when I
was walking and I didn't wear bug spray because he would lick the salt out of my
sweat so I didn't wear bug spray I didn't you know when I showered I would
just use kind of like a very neutral soap I never really use shampoo I just I
was just very bare and I went out and I was just very natural in nature and being
this natural kind of presence there and seeing things happening I was then able
to piece things together and I was then able to be like okay he's hungry I can
tell he's hungry he's he's crying with like a higher pitch in his tone we need
to go and we need to hunt how are we gonna hunt okay well he feeds mainly on
rodents he thinks mainly on reptiles and amphibians and birds you know that
that's kind of like the three main things that he's gonna eat if he can eat
carry on then he might eat carry on if he can eat you know something which is a
little bit larger potentially you know with like baby pigs the fish I have
seen ocelots catching fish but to try and teach that is very difficult I was
teaching Keanu the second ocelot how to try and catch catfish that would sit
dormant in the mud until the rains came and then they would come out into these
little pools but to try and teach a cat that like it's very hard but I've seen
it in the wild where ocelots will walk up and down the stream and they'll
pounce on fish so they do eat fish but you know it's hard it's really hard how
big do they get full grown males and females are different so females will be
a lot smaller you know pounds and kilos and I you have this issue with Andrew
yeah yeah we had this issue but with pounds I think that the females can get
up to like you know 36 pounds max okay whereas a male can get up to like 45 to
50 pounds like they can be quite a big you know small cat mm-hmm and they how
are they different from jaguars there so the size difference is the main thing
mm-hmm what you do have is you have you know they're a lot more so there they're
a terrestrial cat but they're semi I bought arboreal as well so they'll spend
a lot of their times in the trees and they're actually very very good in the
trees whereas Jags aren't very good in the trees they're too heavy they're too
bulky these are a lot more slender a lot more elegant a lot more they're
faster you know their diet is different there if you look at them and you kind
of like look at them from you know Oslo to Jaguar you would say you know it's
just a small jag and a lot of people actually do confuse them but the rosettes
are different they're you know it's it's just they're a very very different
species but you know the reason why they have very very similar patterning is
because that is the most camouflage underneath the canopy right as you can
see they have the white on around their eyes Jags also have the white around
their eyes because they use their eyes at night time and they are so good if you
also look at the backs of the ears of Ocelots they have like white tips to
their ears I didn't you know know why they had white tips I just thought maybe
it was a camouflage thing once they the Ocelots had got older I started
realizing that it was a way of communication they I would be walking
behind them sometimes sometimes I'd walk in front of them but when I was like
walking behind them I would just watch them and just watch and watch and watch
and I would notice that they would twitch their ears to which direction they
were going to be going and they were telling me where they were going to be
going so they would see a rodent that was on the right and they would
twitch their ear on the right and they would be very very stealthy and they
would go that way so what I then realized was how can I increase the amount of
food that he's eating on a night walk well I was reading their ears and I was
then doing what they wanted me to do so if there was a huge log and I saw a
rodent on one side they would twitch their ear on the right so I would go
round on the left and basically cause the rodent to see me the rodent would run
up on the log or run behind the log bam wow then the Ocelots would start and I
started hunting with them then once you get to that part you start to realize
okay this is how they hunt how can they hunt other things so you start taking
them out during the day you start going to areas where you know there's lizards
and you know there's snakes you just watch and watch and watch and I was
downloading this information 24 seven and you know when you don't speak to
anybody when you are just because I was alone in the majority of the time that I
was out with these cats I didn't want anyone to interfere with them so there
was times where I'll go months without seeing people and when you've only got
the ears of an Ocelot to really kind of like communicate with and you can
communicate verbally as well but damn it was just like this download of
information so long story short to answer your question I had no idea what I was
doing when I went there what about like going out at night into the jungle
seems like a terrifying thing to do like what about bigger animals like what
kind of animals prey on Ocelots and did you ever come across anything on your
night walks that scared the shit out of you nothing scared me more than humans
humans are the worst with animals you can read animals if so on one night walk
with Khan I it'd been raining for days and this one night it just kind of like
it just stopped and it was just this really silent but like quiet hot night
and I was like right this is the night where everything's gonna be coming out
I know that everything's gonna be coming out because they haven't eaten properly
for a few days so I went and got Khan and we went on a walk and we were hiking
and I had you know seen a few little snakes nothing major I seen a few frogs
but the ones I'd seen were you know toxic for him here's catching a few
little insects and he would eat insects is like little you know kind of like
granola bar snacks and we got to this area and there was like a few rodents
running about and I was like cool this is you know this is it and so he goes
after something and I'm like oh okay cool maybe he's gonna catch a rat and you
know that'll be his dinner and we can like continue hopefully find a sleeping
bird or whatever and he's in front of me and I'm sat down on the forest floor
and I just hear this kind of like and I was like that's not Khan like I don't
know what that is like my heart started racing you know and I wasn't fearful but
I was the adrenaline was pumping and so I did have my light so I was like
looking around and I was like sniffing and like trying it I didn't want to use
my light because I didn't want to interfere with Khan hunting if that's
what it was and then I heard like a and then like a snap of like a twig behind
me and I'm like right okay so I'm like I have to turn my light on and as I turn
my light on I look round and there's a puma like a mountain line which is about
I would say it was about 20 feet away from me whoa and so it's it's you know
stalking me in a way but it also yes but it also knows that I'm there it's
curious right and all of a sudden I get these claws going up my legs up onto my
shoulder and it's Khan right because he knows that he's there so Khan is on my
shoulder he's trying to get to the highest point of the safest place and
the trees aren't gonna protect him his dad is gonna protect him right so I'm
like oh here we go so I don't make any noise the worst thing that you can do is
run from a big cap because they're gonna be like game on mm-hmm so he's on my
shoulder Khan's on my shoulder and I just have my machete in my bag and I'm just
walking and I keep turning around and I keep seeing him and he's just following
me and I look at the time and I go okay right I'm about an hour's walk away from
where Khan's enclosure is this cat could follow me for definitely as long as that
but you know we'll see if it gets too close I'll just have to kind of shout
but just just walking I was walking in the jungle with an ocelot on my
shoulder and a mountain lion following me for 20 minutes and I just remember the
adrenaline that had and I was looking around and I was thinking he's still
there he's keeping his distance he's just curious you know curiosity kills the
cat and he if I was any other person I had a gun like that cat probably would
have been shot you know because you know you hear all these stories about
mountain lions were doing this and you know doing that and they're just curious
animals they're very very you know intrigued in the smallest of things
and dude I just remember thinking fuck this is nuts I've got two major cats that
I love and they're within you know ten feet of me so we just kept following you
and eventually got back just kept slept you know I just kept following me get
following me and then as soon as I got to this like intersection on the trail I
walked down one and I was expecting him to go off he just carried on walking up
he just was like no there's no food there for me just past you yeah I'm not
I'm not gonna waste my energy he what he would have done he would have killed
Khan but because I was there he realized that the threat was you know major he
he was like there's no way I'm gonna get that ocelot and no joke I had these big
scratch marks in my shoulder and in my leg where he like clawed his way up and
he was just sat there and just like stick like wide-eyed on my shoulder for
20 minutes and he wasn't he wasn't super heavy at the time but like dude it was
it was exhilarating but terrifying at the same time you know so mountain lion
Puma will kill ocelots you also have bigger eagles like the harpy eagle and
I've been fortunate enough to see harpy yeah I've been fortunate enough to see
seven of them and a lot of people will go their entire lives without seeing
harpy eagle and they are just absolutely look at that thing man and that
thing's wild looking you see that one on the right there that one there with the
dude that harpy eagle had actually been shot as a baby and it's only got one eye
and this dude here he actually lives in Puerto where I used to live and he
rescued this harpy eagle and you basically just it can't go back to the
wild that's an enormous bird man yeah so they will they're actually sloth hunters
they will take sloths out of the trees monkeys out of the trees and absolutely
incredible but they also will take ocelots if they have the opportunity to
anacondas if they get big enough they will take ocelots you have big Cayman
I think you saw in the documentary where Keanu was on the back of that Cayman
that was scary as hell because one you know one misstep and a wrong jaw will
take a leg off you know right and so I he needed to learn lessons yes I
couldn't wrap him in a hard way yeah if he was gonna get smacked by that Cayman
he was gonna get smacked by it if he was gonna you know be killed by this
Cayman I wouldn't have let that happen I would have intervened but he needed a
snap on the nose you know right and he did he got that and if you haven't seen
the the documentary yet you'll see it and you'll hear me shout and they
actually had to edit something I was like holy fucking shit you scare the shit
out of me but it was you know scary but I had to let these animals live a
wild life yeah what were they gonna do when I left yeah and I eventually had
to leave my physical my mental my there's only so much time that you can live
alone in the jungle you can do it for a very long time you can do it but when
you're you know alone not speaking to people not having you know conversations
not getting the right medical attention when you're sick not eating the right
diet you know all of these things you start to deteriorate and I think that
you know you can kind of agree with me that you saw me kind of like slowly
dipping in my mental health towards the end of the Keanu because I was I was
ecstatic that he was gonna be like free but I was also so ill and so drained and
so I would I would I was on cloud nine but the storm was above me as well you
know it was like this were you just scared were you dreading the day that he
was gonna just go out to the wild and not come back and leave you alone or what
was it about that that made you I was petrified that he was gonna go and he
was never gonna come back I was never gonna see him and never get say goodbye
mm-hmm because of death disease you know whatever but I knew that that was gonna
happen and I think what my mental state was was I was it's hard to say this I
think that I was leaning on Keanu for a redemption of Khan and obviously I don't
want to say too much about Khan and everything that went on with that because
one I don't really like talking about it and and two I want people to kind of
like read into this story a little bit more I want people to know about Khan and
I want them to you know know about how Keanu helped me get back on my feet
after Khan but I did not want to be the failure that I was with Khan with Keanu
I think that was the biggest feeling of fear inside me well it wasn't really
your fault what happened to Khan right like no I like first of all I had no
idea that people set up trigger traps with shotguns on trees yeah what what
it what it what is that about and why do people who puts those things there
anybody who wants to try and get a quick meal when they're cruising the river so
they're essentially shotguns that are mounted to trees at a low level with
like tripwires is that what it is yes so the one that he you know the one that
he had found was this kind of makeshift piece of shit that was a metal hollowed
out bar with wood a mouse trap you basically put the shotgun shell into the
metal bar the mouse trap is set and the nail which is attached to some fishing
line is basically the hammer to you know to set the shotgun off and so the
fishing line basically goes across the top of the what would be this you know
the scope and it's set across a trail so that when an animal or when a human
because I almost got hit by that I was only about three feet away when that
fishing wire gets triggered it snaps shoots and whatever's in front will then
either be injured or killed majority of the time in just injured right and yeah
and this can be for anything you know when you're setting snares you set snares
for like rabbits and packer and a gooty because snares are going to be going on
specific trails their specific heights that you know they're detailed to that
type of thing right the animal either go through it and get its neck caught and
then strangle itself to death or it'll put its foot through it and then get
caught until the poacher will then come down and then you know do whatever it has
to do to kill it or and they're doing this just because they want food just
food yeah because they usually just wanting you know bush meat with shotgun
traps you don't know what you're going to get it's not a snare it's not on a
trail that is used by specific mammals or rodents you know it's a shotgun which
then will just obliterate anything that triggers it and it could be me could be
Khan could be absolutely tapia you know a tapia is basically just you know a big
jungle cow if I get shot in the in the leg it's going to survive right it's
going to die a miserable death of infection and and you know all these
different things and they're absolutely incredible animals and I've walked
side-by-side with you know so many of these it's kind of like an ant eater yeah
they've got they've got this crazy little nose a little dick nose jungle cow but
they're incredible incredible animals and they and they're great for the
ecosystem and you know if one person sets up a trap and shoots the leg off of
that right what's that going to do to the the rest of them because a tapia has
like an 18 month gestation period then down then the the infant the juvenile
the infant will stay with the mother for two years and then they're not sexually
mature for another two years so if you shoot a female you've just taken out eight
years worth of stuff mm-hmm and animals are clever they will only kill and eat
the oldest and the sickest so I've literally have seen wild cats on
camera trap and in person with tapia next to them they don't want to be there
but they kind of cross paths and whatever you know they've just done
their thing these these tapias are great smelling but their eyesight is
horrendous they don't have great eyesight they use their nose primarily to
travel through the forest whereas cats will use their eyes and you know they
will use their smell as well but their eyes are their primary you know way of
hunting so you'll see these animals crossing paths and if that's not sick or
if it's not an older individual that's a large meal they're not going to waste
that you know that's that's you know one of them things but they're they're
crude every animal is crucial to the ecosystem of the rainforest and when
people hunt they take out crucial elements mm-hmm and they might not think
it but they're taken out especially in the rainforest they're taking out real
important parts of the rainforest every time they hunt and hunters will go in
and they'll take out you know three four pigs and they'll take them back to the
community and it's it's this devastating the only animal that I know that
actually does well from hunting is is an animal called a packer P-A-C-A and
they're like this small jungle rodent stripes on them kind of like a young
tapir actually really really cool nocturnal but just absolutely incredible
they taste good as well hmm but once they find out the you know one of them has
died the females will go into this frenzy of just breeding and breeding no way
yeah coyotes kind of like coyotes yeah and so once they know oh the local male
that you know was around he's not here no more I'm gonna find the next male I'm
gonna have you know how many little pups of you know packer and they are
probably the only animal in the jungle which you know does well from hunting
I'm not gonna say benefits because they know nothing benefits you know that's
that's also a lot food and that's you know jag food and but they they they do
well in a way it's so strange man it's like out of all of the wildlife in the
Amazon there's nothing remotely close to humans right I mean I mean even in the
world right I mean you got you got primates yeah monkeys but it's still so
far away yeah it's like we are we don't belong there no we are this incredible
thing but we're also the cancer of the world as well you know we don't fit in to
the ecosystem not anymore right we we can't one of the things I actually love
is like watching survival shows like alone and just seeing these like these
incredible men and women that go out there and they try to survive in a cold
environment and they just cannot you know and they do well don't get me wrong
like there's there's people that survive like a hundred days or whatever but we
are so we so need our creature comforts we so need our homely kind of like
comforts to thrive and if we did if we weren't clever enough to make a table or
a chair or a microphone you know where would we be there is you've run into any
un-contacted tribes down there I never ran into any but I know that I was in the
presence of some I found an arrow once a six for arrow and what I was doing this
I was doing the car so with Khan and I remember like waking up one morning to
like this booming and I was like what the hell is that and like and I was
pinpointing it to like this direction from where it was you know and it was
just like what is that and it was like ten minutes ago by and I know that
cappuccinos will like break castanian nuts onto the trees and they will do all
these things but this was rhythm this was time this was something that I was I
never I never got an eerie feeling from a cappuccino making a drumming sound right
because I just knew that they were like breaking something open they tried to you
know use tools or they they're clever this was this eerie eerie feeling and I
remember going out off trail trying to find like where this sound was coming
from and I saw snapped branches across the trail and when you see snap branches
you know that it's a sign don't go here and then I heard like and then I never
heard it again and I spoke to I went up river about seven months later I think I
went up river and I was speaking to this local community and I said I just have
this question like I know some of your elders here have spoke they speak the
language of the uncontacted and I know they're on the river can I talk to you
about this thing that I had experienced and they were like please like let me
know and I was like I was you know it was early in the morning I woke up and I
heard this drumming it sounded like it was on the buttress of these huge kind
of like Lapuna trees it sounded like it could have been a monkey but then like
it was too it was like every like two minutes on the dot and it was like very
precise and it was very like it had a lot of rhythm and he said did you hear
any other sounds like whistling knocking any of these things I said well I could
hear something like in the distance but I couldn't hear what it was he goes yeah
that's how the uncontacted communicate if they don't know where one or another
is they will bang the roots of these big trees to let them know in what
direction that they've gone because what they've done is they've used the stream
systems because at this point it was wet season right so they'd use the
stream systems which are a lot higher to you know kind of kayak down with their
kind of like dug out canoes they'd probably found something that they had
killed and then they were telling each other like where they were wow and I was
like holy shit like this was about 400 feet from where I was that's why and I
went and I said oh you know I saw the snapped branch okay did you go past
it I said fuck no it's like I know what that means and they were like good
because you probably would have died they were like we know people that take
two steps past that and they get shot yeah they were probably watching you
that's definitely the most dangerous thing out there right those those tribes
those uncontacted tribes it's just so bizarre that that the one thing that
the one animal species that they will absolutely kill on site are other
humans it's because we're a threat not because we have machetes and we have
weapons but because we carry disease if we come into contact with them and we've
had our injections and our inoculations and we've had our you know COVID
vaccines or you know if you haven't then good for you but like we have had these
things in our system we've taken antibiotics and we've got past these
you know infections and diseases if we go anywhere close then they're dead
they're wiped out right there was a thing in Brazil actually where people
were like you know the uncontacted to come out and they were like look we're
struggling with you know the climate change and every like you know they
didn't say climate change but they basically said with these odd seasons
we are struggling to get food and we're struggling to do this and the mosquitoes
are worse and our families are getting sick and a la la can we get some help
mmm scientists came in tried to give them help and it basically wiped out like
80% of them because they basically got like I don't know what the diseases were
that they gave them but it was kind of like when was this I think this is like
2016 or something really yeah yeah that was like in Brazil it was in Brazil
Brazilian tribe was kind of like taken out by human diseases not sure but what
it was you know that killed them off but it definitely made a lot of people
think like wow we really are messing up the world you know it is just so
bizarre to me that you can have people running around naked in the forest with
bow and arrows at the same time you could have people driving around in
autonomous electric vehicles yeah and you know what's even crazier is that we
see these kind of like you know in our minds we see these kind of like uncount
uncontacted tribes as like these small jungle kind of like you know jungle
people they're extremely tall they have huge feet the reason why you know native
South Americans you know are the way they are these days is because the
Spanish came in and Spanish are a lot smaller and then you know things kind of
like progressed with but these these six for arrows are nothing compared to
these people whereas if you compare them to the majority of the size of people
in Peru you don't get many people that are over the size of 510 in Peru they're
a lot smaller because they have the Spanish influence in them right these
uncontacted people are you know six foot plus they need to be in the jungle
they need to be tall to see things they need to you know their feet are
absolutely massive if you kind of like there's a there was something as well on
a documentary that I watched where the scientists put his foot next to the
the size of an uncontacted tribes foot and yes it's way bigger see that's
something you guys don't have to worry about where you're at they just don't
come around where you guys are in your camps if they do I believe they don't
see a threat if I'm a where I was with the Ocelots was a little bit further
downriver downriver if you go further upriver there's two communities they
actually came from uncontacted tribes and they know of uncontacted tribes in
there and what they do is they sometimes come in and ransack the place they'll
take their machetes they'll take their clothes they'll take everything and the
the communities can't do anything about meaning their descendants of the
uncontacted tribes are there people that broke away from them broke away really
and and when I was last there there were two elders that spoke the native tongue
and so when they would be across the river they would be talking to them and
they'll be talking back talking to them talking back and they say yeah they
just want us to leave them alone you know someone was you know drive you know
using a boat motor and it was scaring way that you know they want us to be
quiet they want us to do all these things but these local communities which
are upriver have grants and have all these things from the government because
they're you know a local community so they have these grants to buy these you
know kind of outboard boat engines and they have these you know for lights and
stuff and sometimes they just get so fed up they'll come in and they'll just
ransack the place and take all of their machetes take everything what is the
language sound like it's a very so it's not Spanish it's more of like a it's
hard to describe honestly it's it's it's a mix of kind of like sounds it's not
sounds it's not like an African kind of like dialect where they kind of like
click and pop it's really it's more of a like repetitive this is really hard to
kind of like describe yeah it's a very I can imagine it as very simple language
very repetitive in the way that they sound and say things I can imagine it as
a very kind of descriptive language but then again you know it's I had no idea
what they were saying when they were talking do you remember Steve do you
remember when we had Luke were caverns on here and he was showing us the videos
of those tribes I forget where they were they were like they were like
communicating like this with music or whatever and like there was this whole
sort of like village of people and they were all sort of like participating in
this like song somehow it was pretty insane music is just this incredible
thing that we have accomplished yeah it's incredible and it's one of the things
that's actually helped me with my PTSD and helped me with the writing of my
book oh really is just music music can calm me when in an anger fit rage it
can lift me up when I'm sad it can set the tone for my day it can help me get
creative and just think that you know years and years and years and years ago
people were just making music around a fire by clicking and singing and humming
and that stuff just fascinates the hell out me that's how you found it it does
something to you it does something to you it connects to yeah this is I think
this is it where are they South Papua South Papua these guys obviously aren't
uncontacted but that's just beautiful yeah it really is beautiful like there's
nothing more there's nothing more settling than just like listening to some
like yeah and and I don't know brings you to a place where you need to be or
you want to be you know music can help that in a great way I actually did a
podcast with a good friend of mine David and he he struggles deeply with
depression and he goes to a lot of like heavy metal gigs and just lifts him you
know it just like makes him he's actually doing a documentary right now on how
heavy metal music has helped him in his mental health state really was he
was he deployed in overseas or something was he in the war he he was he was in the
Navy for a while and he's actually a US Marshal now just getting out very he's got a lot of
stories dude a lot of stories struggling a lot of the minutes I've been keeping tabs with him
just seeing how he is but didn't know him before the podcast and now I feel like I'm best
mates of him you know oh really it's really kind of like I guess it's music music brings people
together yeah I guess podcast you know brings us together I never would have met you if it wasn't
for you know this and yeah I feel like just like the connection of humans is so great but at the
same time we're disappointing this world so much you know yeah we got to get back to connecting with
nature for sure I think uh technology is good yeah it's definitely good and that's we're good at
creating technology but uh when you lose touch with nature uh I don't think it's I don't think
that's good no talking to creations um I actually uh created a non-profit um called Emerald Arch
and that's about nature Emerald Arch is a 501c3 based out of Washington state
that's where I'm currently living right now and what we're going to be doing is we're going to be
buying land in Ecuador it's been a place the after Peru I went to Ecuador and I just fell
in love with it it's an incredible place but it's it's uh it's being hurt deeply by mining and oil
and so as Emerald Arch we want to people to map Ecuador as Emerald Arch we want to buy land
in the jungle and via our non-profit we want to help veterans go to the jungle so they can
take a few steps in in my shoes and in just healing in nature in general yeah and it's just
this beautiful country you can drive from the coast all the way to you know Yasuni national park of
the amazon rainforest in 10 hours um and uh everything you need is there it's an incredible
space medicine like the the plants you can get everything from the plants yeah so um
the the mount the mounts so ever everyone talks about how the amazon rainforest needs to be protected
it needs to be saved it's going to be our life and death you know all these things but what they
missing out in a lot of these conversations is it's actually the foothills of the amazon so the
the andi runoff so in the middle of it you can see the andis which is that huge kind of like
right line if you go down on on the um the east side of that and you kind of go into
like coca and Yasuni and there's you know all these different areas up there if you go into that
it's actually the trees which are in the elevated parts of the amazon which are absorbing way more
of the carbon that we're putting out into the world and so trying to protect all of these little
areas which are being deforested because they're in the mountains and they're good for cattle and
they're good for all these different things is actually way more important than saving the amazon
itself although saving everything is more you know is is is great but the carbon that the
foothills of the amazon is absorbing is like 40 times more really because the higher the
elevation because the canopy is so thick down there and it's just all flat when you go up in
in elevation you have layers which can absorb different amounts of carbon oh wow interesting
yeah so we're looking at a place called napo we're looking in like Tsukumbios region
but we want to buy some land and we're fundraising at the minute to buy this land so that we can
not just protect and preserve work with community members community outreach you know do scientific
research if another ocelot needs help then you know who knows but to take veterans and to take
people who are struggling with mental health to the jungle because i know firsthand that it can
save lives and i know that if we try and protect the amazon rainforest and if we try and protect
our you know our spirit of this world via these trees and via this land via these animals we can
save so many people 22 veterans a day in the us commit suicide if i can change one person's life
i'm gonna fucking do that right if i can change 22 people's lives i've saved a days worth of
suicides from the us alone that's not even the uk the uk has the highest rate of male suicides
in the whole of europe and is that in general or is that veterans in general but a lot of them
are veterans because like me what do they have nothing they work in a factory or they go to the
war the uk is this such a small place crammed with so much so many people and not a lot to offer
male suicide rates in the uk are above what they should be and what they've ever been
and then us suicide rates are continuing to grow it's one of these things which i think emerald
arch is going to try to help as much as we can it's not just going to be a place where we take
tourists it's going to be a place where the psychiatrist is going to be a place where you
can go and you can feel like you're about to commit suicide and you're going to work through it
are you going to recruit some of these guys to sort of help with the conservation and help with
the preserving the the rainforest absolutely and i'm also going to work with local people
i don't think that um i don't think that you can do this as a westerner without the help of the
local people and you know i want to get a bunch of dudes in tactical gear running through the
forest and do a bit for them you know i want that to be a part of it but i want them to learn
from the best right and they can they can do 25 years worth of military training they can
do anything that you want you know nothing's going to prepare them to know the depths of the jungle
you can you can learn and and you can you know be a survivalist and you can camp and you can do
all these things but the heart of the people in in the amazon rainforest is one that you can never
replicate right and you need people to be able to be able to teach and the thing is and what i found
you know i have a good friend called helva and i have a great friend called carlos and they work in
the amazon and they love to learn and they love to speak to different people and they love to
know different things my friend carlos has never been on an aeroplane he's never been on a helicopter
he's never done anything other than fish on that river and drive boats for tourists and
i was in the jungle with him at one point and this helicopter flew over as a military helicopter
doing something he was like oh man that's my dream to go on one of them said wait you never been on
a helicopter like just ignorant you know because i was kind of joking with him as well but never
been on a helicopter he goes you have like his eyes up i said dude i was like in like 20 helicopters
in afghanistan and he was like oh man i showed him some photos of me in helicopters and he was like
what was it like you know just he wanted to know but at the same time what was i doing i was wanting
to learn from him as well right and i would go out in the rainforest and he would be like this is
where you know these coral snakes are found and i'd be like oh okay and i'd you know pick one up
because you're a fucking crazy white dude why are you picking one up and i'm like you know this is
just what i love and i'll teach him and i'd you know this snake here you know this this and this
and he's like thanks for teaching me i said thanks for teaching me where it was you know
give him a big hug at the end of the night and dude they're just incredible people yeah the native
people will never ever be able to be replicated by any other soldier or any other person that's
never lived there um going back to when you were working with kianu and trying to reintroduce him
into the wild it was crazy towards the end of documentary he was like he would come back yes
and you were like trying to scare him away and like yell at him and get him to leave and that was
that was sad to watch man horrible um towards the end of that and leading up to the time when
you actually left how often was he coming back and did you like how accustomed to the wild
did he get and was there still this connection with you that he maintained while yeah he had like
one foot in one foot out it's kind of tricky on a documentary to fit you know two years worth of
work into 140 minutes so he would go for seven eight days and he would be gone and i would just
be sat there twiddling my thumbs you know okay i'll make lunch he's not come back right okay i'll go
check the boat all right it's night time i go on a walk and i'll see if i can either see him or
find something cool and you also had cameras everywhere yeah yeah so i was like i had my camera
traps up and um and uh he would come back and then he would go away and sometimes he would come back
and he's skinny and it was like oh he's not done well so i would go out with him and i would hunt
with him and i would kind of give him a little pick me up i'd give him a few little i'll give him a
few eggs and i'd find a rat and i'd you know just absolutely just destroy this rat and just you know
give him what i could and as soon as he was kind of full up he'd come over and he'd kind of like
give me a nozzle or there's one on my instagram actually of a photo of him we're kind of like
face to face he seemed a little bit more clumsy than the than kan um at least in the documentary
yeah so kind of kind of like that but the thing is with kan kan was very vocal okay
whereas kianu was very much like i'm just gonna kind of like hit you you know like right but we
would kind of just lay together and hang out together and then he would then just kind of
okay i'm gone and he would just walk off and i would walk back and then i would be like you
know going by seven eight nine days and i got to a point of where i was losing my mind because i
wasn't doing anything with him right so i was like i need to leave i need to you know move on with my
life yeah um i yeah just yeah it was yeah it's it's way way down dude probably um yeah here we go
moving into some stuff here and then once you left when did you leave this was the end of 2019
end of 2019 yeah so i came out of the jungle went to the uk and then the pandemic hit okay
and that was even harder for me because i'm like traveling traveling i want to do this i want to do
that on it you know like probably would have been better off in the jungle dude seriously and i found
a loophole i actually flew to um ecuador there was like five days where they were letting a bunch
of people in and i went and spent six months in the jungle just during the pandemic nobody no tourism
no nothing you know wow and it was gray um did you ever get covid i never tested positive right um
you had neither did i no i went to brazil when it was at the highest and i remember feeling a
little crappy but i was you know miles away from a test center and by the time i went there i was
like i'm feeling fine so when you left in 2019 and you went back to the uk did you ever go back
and try to find him so i actually went back in 2021 to the jungle but it was actually to do a
filming gig with a organization called age of union i don't know if you know age of union so
dax to silva is okay yeah i know yes yeah it is he helps out with jungle keepers and you know
he's a huge part of conservation in cred one of my best friends he's an incredible human being
this great guy who made his fortune in his 20s by coding he started the company lightspeed
um he then used some of that money to do conservation projects and now he's focused
in more on conservation projects than you know really anything else yes he's got more money
than he knows what to do with right he was doing stuff with um making films he loves to make films
he loves to educate he was then donating money to different projects he was doing all these things but
he's just an incredible guy um and yeah he just he's got a big heart a big heart and um
he just has this passion to he's a businessman and he is a very good businessman and he knows how
to make money and he knows how to donate money and we need more people like him in the world
because if jeff bezos or if um you know anyone with that amount of billions
did good with it we won't be in the situation we're in right now dax is uh is a changemaker
he is um yeah it's rare it's rare that you find people with that amount of resources and wealth
that aren't just trying to use that wealth to make more wealth right like when they people
make billions it's just like they want more when is there when it's never enough it's never enough
it's very rare to find somebody who's willing to just like do that and do stuff that's good
but what he says that's not going to make them more money more profit what he says is the more
money i can make more for us i can save that is a drive and that is a motivation to make money
is right right more the more you can make the more you can save and yeah that's a good way of
looking at it i was in california with him last month um and uh we were just talking and uh he was
like i'm really you know i went down there to go see him for like a week me and my wife went down
there and he was like i'm really sorry i got to leave i've got to go to um i've got to go back
up to canada to go to all these meetings and you know all this shit is happening and i was like man
like you know is what it is miss work it and he goes i need to go back because i know that i can
make this company more money and i know that via this i can save more land save more animals
and do better for the environment that's the type of person that he is um and you know he's
side by side of paul rosalie um yeah and that's probably how you've probably heard of him um because
of jungle keepers no i heard of him uh because of ryan tate from betpaw came on here yeah yeah
and uh ryan um ryan was he reached out to me and my friend julian dory at the same time and he was
in new york so he went on julian's podcast and he just brought paul with him when he went to go do
my friend's podcast and he was just sitting there in the room and then like started having a conversation
like what like with my friend julian's like you did all this like you were the guy in the show
that caught the snake and all this stuff like you're living in the end like found out a story and
he's like you gotta come on the fucking podcast then paul came down here and came on my podcast
then i learned about dax yeah and uh all that stuff um but yeah paul yeah all these the stuff that
that paul talks about uh in regards to all of the people coming down to the amazon and burning down
huge swaths of land for farming and for the trees uh seems like you know what paul's really
dedicated his life to doing and you know saving it from from all of these industries coming down
and just basically like ravaging the forest for profit and i think he said a lot of the um
a lot of the the industries are funded down there by china that's correct especially especially
for the logging yeah there's a lot that goes on um you know sometimes you hear about forest fires
i think in 2018 was when the amazon burn um was the big thing you know that happens every
single year he's got videos like in the middle of this fire where he's standing there yeah it happens
every single year but people just don't take um take it seriously and uh and it's not really people
burning large swaths of land type in paul rosalie after that you'll find the video of him um it's um
it's people burning small bits of land right but then um is so dry because of the droughts
the everything else catches fire and it just kills off so many so many different things um yeah this
is it oh no that's not it but yeah and i i met paul in 2014 for the first time and uh yeah just
ever since i met him i've just been like this guy just has a mission oh he really does man there yeah
this is the video right here
they such a camera slot oh he loves being on camera man he's like i'm just gonna take my
top off and i'm just my nipples are gonna sweat
so they're burning this down so for for what cattle farming uh for any farming um the majority
of the tribes out there will not actually kind of like do it for cattle but they'll do it for
like papaya and all these things unfortunately the thing about papaya is that all of these
different fruits will suck up out all of the nitrogen in the forest so after five years after
four years they then have to re-burn another plot of land so that they can get you know good better
soil so that they can regrow these things and they haven't learned how to reuse the same plots
of land so a plot of land will be used for three four years they then know that after the fifth
year it's going to get bad so they burn another plot of land they start growing on that then this
one goes bad and right it's just a bad cycle you know yeah so um yeah it's it's unfair um that people
uh you know a part of it's crazy the people that are doing this that are destroying these rain
forests the people that are like boots on the ground cutting these trees down are the and
are the natives um yeah but because they need i mean it's i understand it though i do understand
it like they're poor they need money you need to feed your family it's the most it's the easiest
way to make money it's education if you don't know what your effects are what what the what
the effects are that you're going to be doing you know like it's right but if i'm poor and my
kid's starving i don't give a fuck what the exact is i want to feed my kid you know and that's why
i've seen people hunt monkeys and i've seen people hunt different things and i've seen people cut
down trees because they want to put food on their plates for their families that's it if they knew
the but if they also didn't alternatives then maybe there could be a different route but education
is just not big mm-hmm the government don't care about their people they care about well they're
incentive they're incentivized by the corporations that are that are exporting all of that stuff
right right the government it's the government but it's the government of those countries that
are allowing the exports to come out because they're making billions of dollars from these
trees being cut down and it's just like all the way down the chain you just have these
poor deprived people who are going to do all that dirty work for them yeah it's tricky i don't know
how you stop it it's a good it's a good question that i've found myself thinking about a lot
how do you stop it places like costa rica and places like
even equator is pretty good they're good at it they're good at so so costa rica doesn't have a
military it doesn't have any of these things tourism is like one of the biggest things in
in costa rica because it's costa rica is like it's like a america 2.0 now it's so pretty it's
pretty when i was last there actually i shouldn't say that a lot of the stuff there is owned by
european europeans when i was last there i was there over thanksgiving and like every shop had
like thanksgiving turkey yeah and i was like what the hell like this is all right but um
they use tourism as a way to protect because if they have a influx of people that come in
and want to spend their money to go see a sloth and to do all these things
in a natural reserve and they have guides and they have all these people
then they're making more money from tourism than they are from selling their wood right
what other countries haven't figured out yet is how can we make money from tourism in these
huge places because brazil i don't know how many costa ricas you can fit in brazil but i can
guarantee it's about 30 or 40 or at least and how do you protect everything in there especially
when you know that's where they get all their money they get all their money from beef
a lot of the beef that comes up to the us is from brazil and where are they going to make
you know where are they going to have them cows well brazil is predominantly forest so
they're going to have to slash and burn the forest to then have these cows so that then they can send
it to the us so that then they can get money but if they were able to bring people from the
us to brazil for tourism that made more money than beef that's when it would happen and i'm not
saying that you know go vegan or anything like that is going to save because they're still going
to continue to slash and burn because they need their um they need their family seat they're
going to slash and burn and they're going to grow crops and they're going to do all these different
things um you know if you are vegan then that's great you know every everything helps but at
the end of the day it's not going to stop the deforestation of the rainforest right
we were talking about before we went down this rabbit hole uh i was asked i asked you
if you ever went back to that part of the jungle where you let gear anew go so i went back in 2021
i went down to film with dax and do a small documentary for age of union on jungle keepers
so paul rosalie was there and dax the silver was there and we had a few other people and uh when
i was there i spoke to my she was my girl she's my wife now but she was my girlfriend at the time
and i said look i feel like i need to stay here just for a little bit i don't know why but i just
i've come down for this documentary and now i have a few more months where i can stay here
and bearing in mind i was flip-flopping between the us and wherever because of my visa i was only
allowed here for 90 days at a time so i said let me just extend this out so that i can spend the
majority of time in peru um and whatnot and so when i went there um i was working with jungle
keepers and i was patrolling and i was working with my friend neary at the time and you know
dina and all these really cool people and i was finding really cool animals and i was camera
trapping and i was photographing all these different things and um the thought of going
across to try and see qianu um because on the land that i was working on at the time um he we
were kind of near the edge towards the end and with territories from male ocelots they have to
move territories if they're being pushed out from another male otherwise they're consequently gonna
die i knew that he went into a jungle keeper's land or concession so i said to neary i was like
i want to go uh on this kind of hike with you it borders where i used to work and where i'm working
now and if he's there and he knows i'm there and he comes out to me great but i do not want to say
anything because if i go there and i start going qianu and you know i start you know growling
towards him and all these things like come here like i've got eggs for you i'm potentially putting
him back in his reintroduction that's if he's still alive too much i did everything i possibly
could to make him as wild as he possibly could be so i hope that he's still alive and if he's not
he has offspring somewhere and he has gone on to you know do whatever he had to do right right right
i did not want to jeopardize the fact that i had done all of this work and i had said the
hardest goodbye i'd ever had to say to then just peel that scab off be like i'm back like hi and he's
like you got me any fucking eggs dude i'm like no i don't right so it was it was a hard decision i
wanted to call out his name so bad but at the end of the day i was like why did i do all of this
did i do this for a good reason or am i gonna jeopardize it you know right right
what i did was the right decision i thought yeah yeah i think so too you see people who
you know have done reintroductions and they go out and you know these animals come flying back to the
they're not truly wild right and qianu when i let him go was ferocious like i i have scars all
down like these ones were self-inflicted but i have scars all over my arms and legs and someone
you know just if he wasn't happy if he was you know just in a bad mood or he wanted food or i got in
the way of him he would fuck me up he bit me so hard through the leg once that i um like there
was a trap nerve for like three weeks and i couldn't get it and they just kept bleeding and oh it was
and in the jungle it's a hard thing you know and i've had diseases i've had leishmaniasis i've had
dengue i've had you know oh really i've had so many but you know i've had all these horrible
things but being attacked by a wild animal because you know he is at this point he's wild
he isn't um you know just this little kitten that sleeps is that him right there on your neck
this one is khan that's khan okay qianu is the pattern that goes all the way down my back
oh they duplicated the pattern on your back i uh took a photo he was sat one day just perfectly
on the trail and i just got above him and snapped a photo and i was like that's really cool like i
really love how it's kind of like unique but at the same time it's camouflaged and i love the color
of the orange and the leaves and his orange of his coat and um while i was in the jungle i had so
much time to think about my tattoos i was thinking right i haven't got my back done i think i'm gonna
you know my whole stomach is lord of the rings and so i was like should i continue to order the
rings on the back should i get the bow rug should i do all these different things and i was like
i could do that it's a bit geeky but i could do that and then i just remember just continuously
looking at this photo and being like i want to replicate that it goes from the top of his head
down to his tailbone i have that space like why don't i do it right so when i got back my good
friend brad he was like uh i guess i guess we're doing this and he spent six hours just blacking
out my back lord yeah uh i got to get leaked real quick let's take a quick break yeah have you ever
seen the uh the videos of people on instagram that like keep those big wild cats in their apartments
you know i think with my algorithm mainly being wild i've only ever come across like a few of them
um there's like some i don't even want to kind of like boost his name out there but he's this like
handsome looking kind of dark skin dude that basically just has like all of these like animals
and i'm like why you know like i just don't get it it's so weird i just don't get it it's so weird
there's there's one we were looking at before you came in here we were recording like a little
patreon pre-show and there's uh there's this guy who has i don't think it's um an awes lot
it's a little bit bigger than that it's got huge ears and like a serval yeah i think so it's
called uh it was a serval pull it up steve it was called striker the cat i think yeah i just
don't get that he gives the thing like like full raw chickens and the things like growling and
hissing at him that dragging this deadness draw chicken across the floor yeah what kind of person
the exotic animal trade yeah that's it one of the most um is one of the most kind of like
disturbing things especially if you kind of like look at africa and look at what they're doing with
ivory and pangolin and all these different things and then when you see like this animal here it looks
to some degree healthy it looks to some degree like somewhat content but it's it's in the wrong
place it's in a fucking apartment yeah it's in the wrong place and it's like why and the majority
of people that have these animals will declaw them so they'll take their claws out and they'll grind
down their teeth the ocelots that were captive in peru that would be in people's homes they would rip
their nails out from their nail beds and they would grind their teeth down and they'll be just
chained up and they would feed them like rice and whatever oh my god how depressing is that
animals life you know like it's just but the thing is idiots online will look at that and be like
that's fucking cool right i want to get one right and it's like you are a part of the problem
yeah i was trying to figure out like what kind of person wants this massive fucking wild animal
in their house that is it's not anything like a house cat right this thing it's super inconvenient
to have this thing living in your house feeding it raw chickens all the time yeah it's either just
like an instagram thing to like get more of a social media following or like well how many
followers does that thing have probably a few it's got millions i think go go back to the page
steve click on the the yeah right there 800 000 812 000 followers and that's 812 000 idiots that
just uh vicariously living their dream exotic animal or it could be people that are just like me
looking at this and i'm like what the fuck is wrong with these people and i'm sharing it i'm
like look at them i show i said my friends i'm like look at this how weird is it that these people
want this thing in their house yeah that's hissing at them and like growling at them all the time
and it's wrong but it is just it's just that sense of uh uh superior kind of like feeling you know
like is that what it is it must be why why would anyone want a tiger or a liger or anything it's
because you feel like you're better than everyone else yeah it's just sad oh my gosh those pumpkins
are full of chicken pieces feeding it raw chickens it's like there's like a little presence
gosh it's so hissing at them so bizarre it is so bizarre idiots dude oh my god um so
yeah i wanted to ask you how did you meet andrew yookles yeah uh so i was down doing the caron
project and uh andrew came out he was on a quest to catch so many different animals dude like
he just wanted to catch them oh yeah yeah just wanted to catch him film him film him you know
this is when like his youtube days were kind of like sliding off the edge but and he'd just gone
through all of that crap with um the network where they kind of like gave him three episodes and
basically told him fuck off yeah he came out and he was like i tell you harry don't fucking trust an
american don't do this they're all fucking you know he just was he was a loose unit at that point
and uh i was out there doing the caron project he was out there because he had spoken uh to pool
i believe and pool was like yeah come out and you know so i just lived with him for like three months
and um i helped him film i helped do all these different bits and pieces um
he's got so many stories on this guy he's wild dude i didn't even i i didn't even watch all of his
youtube videos until after he came in i watched more and he's got like videos where he finds a dead
uh what was it it was an emu a dead emu catches kangaroos guts the emu wears the dead emu over
his body and then fucking catches kangaroo not honestly like there's as crazy as he is he has
a hard gold and i love him to death but some of the things i've had to go through with him like
the first time i went to so i met him in peru we did a bunch of filming we did a bunch of stuff
then after the loss of khan i needed some rest i i needed to get away from that place it was toxic
to me and i messaged him and i was like i don't know what to do he said come out to australia
i've got you i said okay so i flew out to australia and i spent six months in australia just i spent
about three months with him uh-huh um but for the rest of it i just basically used his uh truck
he had to go to ty he was like meeting some girl in thailand and he just got his foreskin cut off
or something like that like it was like some weird three months i didn't know what he was doing but
he was doing foreskin cut off oh yeah he the guy's got a massive and he just couldn't use his
because his foreskin was too tight what so he went through this whole fucking process
his foreskin was too tight oh yeah it was strangling his dude and like there was so many times where
i'd go into the truck and i'd go get something and he just had like a flashlight just like
hanging out and i would like drop on me and i'd be like oh a flashlight yeah dude the guy is a sex
addict oh my god but he's not just an animal at heart he's an animal in the bed as well a bit
but he uh dude i spent so much time with him and we went fit you know we do it we did everything
we weren't catching snakes we like i told you before this we were catching cane toads just so
that he could uh one they're invasive and you know they're bad for the ecosystem but two he
wanted to make shoes out of these cane toads so he would kill them dry them out in the sun we
live by this like water hole for like a whole week just catching cane toads drying them out making
shoes just like it was just it was you know he's the the correct amount of autistic you know like
he's just this perfect combination but he can be too much at times yeah and uh we've got a good friend
a mutual friend of ours called dingo and um it it's just like me and dingo just shitting on
andrew yookles and andrew yookles just shitting on himself because he just knows that he is crazy
and he knows that he's but he's just he's he's so he's such a nice person at the same time you know
and so i spent a lot of time with him in australia um and then i left for australia and i went back to
peru and then i did the kianu project and then after that just kept in touch with him constantly
you know he goes off and does his adventures and i don't hear from him for like four or five
months at a time but you know i know that he's just if he dies he's dies doing what he loves
and if he reaches out he's he's done something that no one's ever done before right first time i ever
uh caught a wild donkey with him was one of the most intense situations we were driving down the road
and we find this opossum his possums crossing the road so he runs out the car is still like
it was like in third gear or something he just jumps out the car just stools i'm like what the
fuck am i doing he runs out and he's just running shirtless he grabs his opossum he goes oh that's
an opossum i was like i saw it on the road i didn't need to see it like this close no wonder
you get rabies scares all the time oh my god and then um we're driving and we we've come across a
bunch of uh you know lizards and snakes and frogs and salties and freshies and you know all these
things then he goes oh my there's a fucking donkey and i was like oh okay and he goes you
want to catch it i guess so he goes all right and the car keeps it on headlights are on full beam
and he just starts sprinting like and he's a fast guy like he if he really put his mind to it he
would be like up there with the top in the world like he is really fast even with the next slowing
even with that just slapping his legs like he is so quick and so he's you know so far ahead of me
and i'm like okay like i've i've got my phone and i've got this i want to take some photos if we
he's like grab it and i was like uh and he's like just fucking grab it and i was like uh
so i'm like okay like i guess so i go around it fucking tries to fucking kick him whoa
oh it's fucking kick me in the dick and i was like okay and he just grabs it puts it in a
headlock and just like pins it to the ground and i was like okay he's like oh yeah i do it all the
time i was like let it go all right you guys you want a photo and i was like okay guys just
grab it by the head and just so i'm just like there just like holding this donkey like what the
fuck am i doing like this is just nuts and for three months solid we were just out on the boats
there was this one time he was like you know as as he said you know saltwater crocodiles are the
most dangerous in the water which they are and we'd see them on the bank sometimes and sometimes
like they would be massive and they would be so big that they wouldn't even budget an inch because
they would be like fucking i'm standing on the ground like i'm coming up here he would be like
let's play a game and i'm like what's that you guys let's slap the croc on the ass whoever can do it
so he'd run up and just slap a croc on the ass and he'd fucking sling around and try and get him
he's like harry you do it and i'm like dude like you're gonna fucking die you guys do it and i was
like all right so i'll run up i slap it on the other side i'll come back i was like
you're nuts yeah he's a maniac but he's a fucking legend the story about that he told me on the
podcast about him trying staying all night trying to catch a honey badger yeah for like two days
two days no cameras he wasn't trying to make a video or anything he just really genuinely wanted
to catch a honey badger yeah no evidence no proof just wanted to fucking do it but the thing is
like a lot of the stories that we all have as you know conservationists and as you know nature of
people a lot of the time you don't have time to film things and so the time where i had gone out
with khan and the mountain lion followed me i didn't have my camera because for the days
previous to that it was dumping with rain and i wasn't able to film because i didn't have waterproof
stuff so i was like it's probably gonna dump there's so much rain so i went out and it's the
times where you don't have your camera it's the times where you don't have the equipment that you
need is the times that you get these incredibly encounters and incredible things and like i said
at the at the beginning of this podcast i didn't do any of these things with the intent of making
a documentary right i did these things because i was just doing them and i was filming what
i could at the time and it was just you know these fun unique insights into kind of the life
that i was kind of living so i and i i believe it i spent a lot of time with that dude and i
believe that he sat there for two days just sitting there not eating he probably was worried to go
for a piss because he was like if i stand up it's gonna run right and he gets so locked in you know
but he's a legend legend and i've spent some good time with him in the bush i spent some good time
with him in the jungle have you ever been out to that place arnhem arnhem land uh we did we went
to a place called owen pelly um which is kind of like the border of arnhem land and uh i remember
we were like running up these rocks uh looking for dingos and um we went into these like kind of like
rock holes like they're kind of like caves but they're just like slits that you can just about
fit in and i remember going in there i didn't have a light with me i just had like my phone and
stuff so i put my light on and i just like step on something and i'm like whoa what was like it
didn't feel like wood or i didn't feel like rock or anything and i stepped back and it's someone's leg
and and the uh the aboriginal people would put their dead relatives in these areas and so we were
like looking for dingos in like these burial sites in in arnhem land and and like finding all these
like really cool paintings of like um kangaroos and crocodiles and all in these caves and it was
just like i i know that i'm not the first person to go there because people have been there but i
felt like the first white person to ever see these incredible things and it's just like in this yeah
this place called owen pelly was just like absolutely just one of the most beautiful places we sat
me dingo and andrew sat up on these rocks and we could see this storm coming in like miles away
and we were uh we were like counting down like when the lightning was going to strike
and we were just watching like this lightning striking and like you could just feel the room
like all in your body right and so i've been to arnhem land only sections of it because um you
know legally permits you need to have them luckily we knew someone via a friend of ours um
Aaron Connolly who knew you know of someone who was a ranger there and they were like yeah
you can go in there but just don't don't get caught type thing and we weren't doing anything you
know outrageous or anything but um yeah to walk across it that's yeah and the way he had to like
survive by catching hand catching water buffalo and stab in their jugulars like brutal he's uh
he's a menace but yeah man i've you know during my time you know doing
the ocelot projects and everything like that i've met some incredible people i met my wife
in the jungle actually oh really she came out to do a project and the project kind of fell through
because permits were needed she was going to reintroduce monkeys at the time but
you know it didn't work out and so she was camera trapping and she came and stayed with me she
actually met Keanu Keanu followed her to the the bar from one night and just pounced on her and i
was like he's just smelling the purse see if it's good you know she's gonna hate me for that comment
but yeah no like i've met some of my best friends i've met in the jungle and um and it's because
when you're there you don't have any connection to the outside world it's just you and your thoughts
and your friends and your conversations and you really get to know the true person when when
you're face to face with people like that and i think that that's one thing that we're lacking in
this society is really finding um the true the trueness of people when you're constantly behind
a camera when you're constantly in front of a camera when you're constantly posting things that
aren't true when you're constantly kind of like trying to be better than everyone else or when
you're in the jungle you don't have anything apart from your conversation and you're you know
your trueness your rawness right how often do you go back at the minute because i got married
i'm in the middle of my green card so i can't actually go anywhere on my visa apart from
inside the us oh really i've just been doing a lot of trips a lot of the stuff that we've
kind of like scrolled up and down on have kind of been like florida and arizona trips that i've
been taking okay living in the pacific northwest is pretty difficult for my mental health because
it's quite it's cloudy all the time rainy all the time you know so moved to florida man ukels
said that this is australia 2.0 oh it is it is um but i don't know dude my wife loves the family
that she has up there and i love her family fantastic and they're just pacific northwest
and i i compromised with her and said when we get married you know if i need to get away from
the pacific northwest i can go on a trip i can go on a guys trip i can go do you know all these
things and um yeah i get to travel a lot during this moment but once it's cold up there too oh
it's cold but once my visa's through you know i'm allowed to do all these different things
it'll i'll be forwards and backwards from ecuador i'm planning on doing six months in ecuador six
months in the us um yeah but for now i'm uh i'm just kind of doing some stuff here i have a project
actually in the everglades where i'm camera trapping florida panthers oh really um i have a
project in peru which i'm helping with with a friend of mine who is camera trapping down there
i've actually bought a few more cameras down so that i can do a few more camera traps this um
this trip i actually fly back uh in in five days and so for that i'm just going to be out catching
snakes photographing snakes really like different things by yourself you got people you're meeting
a guy actually that lives in hendery county who has also spent a lot of time in ecuador in amazon
his name's shawn mchew he's one of my best friends great guy and he lives and works with
the seminal community in hendery county and he says anytime you want to come down come stay with me
you know so every time i come down to florida i just go and live with him and we go out and we
catch cool things and we you know just reminisce about you know all of the things that we've done
and he is a a incredible biologist he's worked with florida fishing game he's like done a bunch
of stuff with that he's now working with the seminal communities he's working with you know um
transects and kind of like different pieces with he's doing um crested cara cara surveys and he's
like helping you know seminal people uh euthanized pythons which are you know destroying the ecosystem
of the everglades right pythons and i think iguanas iguanas yeah but the pythons are the the big
thing because they're actually taking the number of bobcats and florida panthers down because they
will take a kit and out easy really and so you know that that ecosystem is very fragile at the best
of times i can't remember the last time i saw a florida panther i have never seen one alive on my
instagram you can probably see um a little bit lower than that i actually found a dead one on
the side of the road up oh yeah you just passed it i saw that and um it was heartbreaking look how
big that paw is man it was heartbreaking i um i came here and this was my first day and um yeah
that's so sad what a beautiful creature absolutely killed me um and so now because of this um i've
been putting cameras up to see if cats have this disease which causes their hind legs to lock up
so that uh cat that individual was found to have this disease which basically this one this one was
found to have this disease which basically causes their spinal cord and their back legs to lock up
and so what they're thinking is a lot of the cats which are found dead on the roads might not be able
to evade the car because they basically get like a temporary paralysis oh shit and i've actually
got camera trap footage of bobcats in pacific northwest who have it where basically their
back legs are like super stiff and so with the project that i have it's only a small one i'm
just trying to do my little part here but i'm working with an organization called f-stop as well
and they do a lot of camera trapping throughout the everglades and um basically uh trying to get
video evidence of if these panthers are struggling and if they do struggle and we can
ID them i mean florida panthers are very hard to ID because they don't have any rosettes they
don't have any patterns so you can't ID one from the other very easily unless it's male female size
injury scar you know all these these few things if we have as many cameras up filming these animals
as possible then um we're hoping that we can you know ID if one gets hit by a car did it have this
did we see that it has this does this have you know what are they getting this from
i i couldn't tell you how it's transmitted from no idea no speculation it could be in their genes
there's also i think there's a few videos or or even just photos of panthers that i've caught on
my camera traps um if you go up florida panther florida panthers yeah so that's a jag from um maybe
up one or yeah there's a panther on the right oh yeah i got on my camera trap um i got a video of
this female and it just walks straight up to the cameras and i just have you know this
a lot of people come to the everglades and they want to see a panther or one want to see these
things and i don't know whether it's my time with these cats in the jungle but i came down for the
first time camera trapping i put a camera up and within three days i got florida panther
i knew where to put the camera because i could smell where the cats were i'm not joking you
i could smell where they were they mark their territories all the time and the smell of a
cat's urine is you know and if you go to that round to our friend's house or if you've got
catcher so if you know that their urine is very fragrant you know that if you leave is it carries
diseases and it's smelly with cats in the in the wild their smell is just it's it you can hardly
smell it but when you get a hint of it you can kind of like and i was tracking these tracks for a while
and i knew that this tree would be good because i could just smell that there were cats in this area
and i've had five different individuals walk past this one camera trap wow and there's only
about 180 to 200 left in the wild 180 to 200 that's the rough estimate all in florida all in
well florida panther is the subspecies of the north american mountain lion okay and the main
thing that's taking them out is the pythons main thing that's taking out the adults is traffic
like collisions with cars main thing that's taking out the cubs is most probably the pythons
have you heard of a guy named carlton ward yes yes he's got some incredible photos and he made
an incredible documentary as well pull up his instagram steve he lives like five minutes away
from here yeah um and yeah he's been he's been a big shot photographer around here for a long time
and uh i think he's used to be like a surf photographer i uh i kind of fanboyed a little bit
when my video of the panther that was um dead on the side of the road was getting all these views
and he kind of like he like followed me and like reached out and i was like really that is something
you know even even though i don't really like the whole social media side of things keep scrolling
it really is this incredible thing where someone who is so prolific in what they do
like reaches out and like looks at what i've done yeah you know that's a good feeling even
though it was a horrible thing but yeah he uh him and his documentary and you know just
he's done some incredible things for the Everglades what is that right there that looks like a
scuba diver he's probably under the water in the uh oh yeah look at that what a wild photo man
probably got some manatee photos or some uh alligator photos or something
yeah but yeah man there's there's uh a lot of things in the Everglades which i would happily
move here for yeah i would and uh i'm just gonna get the whole family to move down man oh i know
that'd be an expensive trip but yeah while i can i'm here and i and i cat you know last time
i was here i found the pygmy rattlesnake i found the eastern dimer back i found the cotton mouth
look at the freaking head on that thing dude um but yeah i've uh i come down here as often as i can
because the wildlife in this in this state is man you can't be it yeah you can't be it like on one
night i went out for two or three hours and i found 11 snakes in two hours i go out looking for snakes
you know my main reason for going to the jungle the first time was one suicide but two to do stuff
with reptiles and amphibians right it's what i live for i traveled to arizona one of my friends
roger walker is actually coming down from arizona today i'm picking him up from the airport and
we're just going to go do four days of just hard like looking for snakes he's never seen an alligator
he's he's only lived in like california and arizona you know and he lived in germany before that his
his dad was in the military um but he's only ever lived in states where there's been no
crocodilian species so he is just ecstatic to see his first alligator and so um have you ever been
bitten by a snake oh yeah really really poisonous ones uh i've never been bitten by a venomous snake
i have been bitten by a reafang venomous snake which basically it can kill people and there has
been cases of people being killed by a reafang venom but the majority of the time that venom is
used to basically decompose the harder scales of lizards and fish that they eat right so the venom
and the toxin that they put into a human's body isn't necessarily enough to kill them if you're a
healthy person but if you do get anaphylactic shock you then could potentially die and then with
non-venomous snakes i've you know been bitten you know multiple times um but i have this respect
for snakes and i've you know i'm not going to jinx anything but when i see a snake i can kind of
tell if it's in a good or bad mood it's a really weird thing and so i know if if it's going to be
in a good or bad mood i just i can keep my distance or get as close as i possibly can to it and with
my photography um i actually use like a a wide angle so i have to get pretty damn close because
i want to have like the kind of backdrop to it i use a diffuser as well which kind of like lights
up because the majority of the snakes that i find are usually at night time um and so
i just go and and i don't know i this passion of mine has been here since a kid i have
ran wild looking for animals and now that i'm living in the u.s and i can't leave i'm just
exploring what i can with um with u.s uh native and and invasive species that i've never seen
before i have like a checklist you know and i try and just check off as many snakes as i possibly
can um as many animals as i possibly can yeah but yeah man i just i just love my photography
it's not even for it's not even like it's just a passion i've got and i just love finding an animal
and being able to take a photo and being able to show my nephews and being able to show my little
brother and you know just being able to educate people on the fact that you know yes this snake
may be venomous but it's it's only gonna bite you if it's fearful for its life it's only gonna
bite you if you corner it and you start messing with it just gives me the chills looking at that
man i i don't i don't drive well with snakes i'm not a fan you should come out we'll go catch some
no i don't want nothing to do with any snakes bro i'll i'll i'll talk with crocs but no snakes
my buddy my buddy manny hunts crocs with those things
yeah not crocs gators gators gators yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's uh he hand makes those uh
those tridents they're crazy he got bit by a rattle snake and lost his finger yeah that will do it
yeah yeah the uh neurotoxin yeah man he uh he said that he they well they weren't gonna amputate
his finger he was gonna they were gonna keep it they gave him all the uh the antidote or whatever
for it and um he went back home and he said he just had like the worst pain in his whole and his
hand in his arm for like months for like three months he had this just stabbing pain like his
whole arm was on fire and then he went back in and there's like we just got it we got to amputate
your fingers they cut off his uh i think it's his middle finger and eventually the pain subsided
like six months later snake venom is an incredible thing i uh i know someone that got bit by a bush
master uh which is one of it's the largest ground viper in the world you see it's found in the uh
the amazon rainforest um and it can kill people in four hours they're just an absolutely incredible
snake um but very powerful and uh this guy that got bit suffered with gallstones all his life
like all his adult life as soon as he got bit by that snake and he survived that bite he's never
had an issue really got rid of him no way whoa dude i wonder why i wonder what that does to your
body oh that photo back the the last fight the one just above with cristillette he lives in florida
as well he he would be a really good person to have on the podcast because he uh he has a sanctuary
