Pete Zuccherini is an underwater cinematographer and native Floridian who is known for shooting
big budget feature movies.
Some of which include Pirates of the Caribbean, Life of Pi, The Hunger Games, Spider-Man,
Suicide Squad, Jurassic World, Terminator Salvation, Spring Breakers, The Beach Bum,
End of the Blue, as well as TV shows like Ballers on HBO, Breaking Bad, Bloodline.
He's filmed commercials for brands like Dior, Armani, Sandals Resorts, Bud Light, Adidas,
Levi's, Issa, and the U.S. Navy.
Today we met up with Pete at his home in Kibis Game and he took us around Biscayne Bay where
he grew up diving in flash fishing and where he first started doing underwater photography
and film.
So I grew up on Kibis Game which is connected by a bridge to Miami so it's really more a
suburb of Miami than anything even though geologically if you look at a map it would
look like the beginning of the Florida Keys.
Growing up in this area this is kind of your first adventure like Soldier's Key, Ragged
1, 2, 3, Boca Chita Sands, Elliott, and then a few more islands on to North Key Largo.
You know in our small boats we would like two of us getting the water one day in the
boat and we would drift with our Hawaiian slings and spear some snapper and things in the channels
and then after we'd catch a few fish we would stop for lunch and then when the tide would
turn we'd clean our fish and we'd have like a few heads and things left over and we'd
hang them off the boat and when the tide would turn back out the water would get kind of
funky and green not so pleasant for diving and sharks would come in that patrol these
area and out in the ocean and in our little boats we'd have giant sharks coming up the
back of the boat.
We didn't really have a purpose for them we just liked seeing them so when we'd clean
our fish we'd hang the fish so the sharks would come by and then we would just take
pictures and scream at them because it was exciting to see them.
It was definitely my early exposure to being fascinated by sharks you know having a fourteen
foot boat and a fourteen foot hammerhead nosing at the back of it trying to like bite off a
mangrove snapper head.
Just transition into taking photos and jumping in the water.
So eventually when I was you know about eleven years old I used I wanted to get an underwater
camera and my dad was like well you know how are you going to do that.
So my dad made a good deal for me but it was maybe a better deal for him he said I'll buy
you a lawn mower and then you can make money so you can buy your own you know your underwater
camera mowing people's lawns on the island so and then for him to pay for the lawn mower
I had to mow our lawn basically for the rest of my life so it was like a good deal for
him too.
What kind of camera did you get?
I bought a Pentax K1000 and an Eichleid housing okay and that was my first camera and I shot
a lot with that with a twenty eight millimeter lens and I learned a lot about underwater
photography in those days.
So how does someone like you like how do you get started in a world like this I mean obviously
there's a point where anyone picks up a video camera but like from to go from there to where
you are it's like you've reached the summit of what someone can achieve as a filmmaker.
Well I don't know about that I mean I'm sure there's some people out there I know that
there's some people out there doing some beautiful stuff with wildlife which is where I started
that may or may not be interested in narrative features which is what I've been doing mostly
the last few years but I think I've just been really blessed and focused on honing my craft
of understanding how to tell stories with cameras underwater and it's really you know
filmmaking is inherently a collaborative medium so it's really about good communication with
directors and directors of photography and performers to get it all together make it make
something cool.
And you must film like like what five to six movies a year something like that?
Yeah I do probably on average I do probably five or six movies a year and one of them
will be water like we have a lot of water so five or six movies that have a water scene
and then one movie that has a significant water component so like in years past to say
a pirate to the Caribbean has a lot of water but then I might do films like Into the Wild
that have a water scene in them or motorcycle diaries that has a water scene in it but then
come back to a film like In the Heart of the Sea or Life of Pi that has a significant water
component to it which would take up a portion of my year.
Sometimes I might do a scene that only requires a day or two in a tank or the ocean and other
times it's two weeks sometimes it's two months or sometimes it's a year.
I'm breaking bad how much did you actually film of that was it like a pool scene?
I just went into a pool and filmed that little teddy bear floating around that became a motif
throughout that.
I happened actually I did that scene just because I happened to be in New Mexico where
they were shooting when I was working on Terminator Salvation.
How chaotic is your life having to travel like it seems like you don't stay in one spot
for very long and you have to like go from Florida to freaking Columbia to California
Well I'm based in Keebus Game Florida which is an island connected to Miami through a
causeway but it's a lot of travel for water work you know usually do some ocean or river
location and then go back to a studio to do close-ups pieces that you didn't get in the
natural location or maybe they want to do a performance with an actor that wasn't available
to go through a rapid river or something.
So it's commonly like you know doing stunts first working out the action in the wild place
and then coming back to a studio water body somewhere to do more controlled light and
performance.
Out of all those movies you've done what is like your most memorable or craziest experience
that you've ever had?
I worked on a film called Diarios de Motocicleta which is a story about Che Guevara that was
set in the Amazonian Peru.
Walter Salas was the director.
Gabriel Garcia Bernal was the lead and I get a call from my friend of mine who's a producer
saying we've got the director insist that we swim at night across the part of the Amazon
that Che Guevara actually swam across and all the locals that are helping them with their
water safety are saying it's basically impossible that it's I'm not going to say haunted but
basically those are the kind of language that was being used as just a death trap and they
were they had some very unusual ideas about trying to like rope off the river but there's
like 20,000 pound trees floating down the river when you know when the Amazon swells
from a rain it pulls part of the bank down into the water in fact the week before we
shot it pulled half of our set homes into the water and I was tasked with figuring out
how to get the actor swimming in this real part of the river section and it's kind of
funny because I had just finished a wildlife show about a mother alligator in a remote
part of Florida and I had a great herpetologist that had been working in this part of Peru
and I knew they'd come back from there so I got his guidance on a few things you know
we reviewed sort of checking for drag outs from crocodilians and piranha are not nocturnal
so we'd have to worry about those so there was this little fish that was rumored to be
able to swim up your urethra that is like a legendary you know painful and damaging
thing so then I had another friend who had been a bush doctor down in that area he had
worked in like you know like doctors without borders kind of program and he gave me some
guidance on some type of snail that lays eggs that get on you when you're in the standing
water and that if you let them sit on you for more than 24 hours they're like burrow in
your skin and eat your cartilage but all you but there was a there was a solution for every
one of these calamities and I and I went down there sort of armed with the whole quiver
of of protective measures and we got the scene of him swimming across the river and then
swimming up onto this muddy bank and all the lepers from the leper colony come down and
pull them out of the mud and it's a beautiful scene I was really a great experience and
I was one of two Americans on the project there was a special effects department from
Italy there was a stunt team from France there was like people from all over the world was
and we're all living in this remote hotel in the Amazon area approved about two hours
boat ride from Iquitos and you know sometimes the biggest box office films are not necessarily
the most you know phenomenal work experiences sometimes they are sometimes you know sometimes
are great experiences like on life of Pi Ang Lee is like a true artour I mean he everything
has to be as he imagines it there was a scene where the main character Pi has to he's they're
crossing a big ocean crossing with their family and their whole zoo in the hold all the animals
and he goes out for like a starlight walk on the deck and he goes out on deck and at
first it's like very invigorating he goes a spray is hitting him in the face and he
starts looking at the open ocean and then he looks forward and he sees that this is
a really heavy duty storm surge like this giant swells washing over the bow and he sees
people getting washed like washed over the deck and he realizes they're in an emergency
so he has to run back into the boat and go down three flights of stairs and when he gets
back to where he came from the last companion way that he walks through is underwater and
because the film has so many fantastical elements you know very painterly elements a lot of things
that are that are animated and sort of surreal and hyper real because there's so much fantasy in
the film he wanted the photography to be super real meaning that even though they're gonna paint in
all of these glorious things that the actual actor in the camera will have a very accurate
photographic relationship so there won't be just cuts or or or computer generated dissolves he
wanted the actor to run down three flights of stairs go underwater come back and go back
underwater in one take which was about a minute long but it's a 3d camera in an underwater
housing that weighed about 200 pounds so going down three flights of stairs at full speed with a
teenager and then diving underwater and come as very technically challenging if you watch the
film it looks very fluid and seamless like someone was running with a GoPro that was smooth but
it's a 200 pound 3d native rig well we started off you know looking at the set and realized it was
impossible you know to move the camera through without supporting the sheer weight of the camera
with some type of system from above so we had we took about seven days to get the shot if you
include having to redesign the set because we had to I'd run down the stairs with the camera
suspended on a sliding track and a bungee and as I took my step off the last flight of stairs
the stairs would fly away the grips rigged phenomenally and then the next set it swung
away and then the final step I have to like go full speed and we had just worked through all the
then that camera has to get pulled underwater floated back up and pulled back underwater
because to have a buoyant 200 pound camera and a camera that can sink that's that creates its own
sets of challenges so we had just walked through the whole process and we get a note that ang wants
to try it right now and we had just like done it with baby steps so you know we did a take and of
course he was like faster faster and then on the third take it was I I said we can go a lot faster
but it's a 200 pound camera it's like a wrecking ball if he slips or anything this camera is just
going to mow him down it's just it's too much inertia even though we have it supported and the
stunt coordinator had been working with Sudhaj the actor said he can do it you know he's very
confident he's moving down the steps great so he went full speed I went full speed dove in after
the feet disappear in the bubbles he pops back up and we thought we had a pretty good pass our
third take after working it out for seven days and I came up and I said what did Ang think
and they said I don't know I said what do you mean you don't know he said he he left
he left the studio he went over back to the other stage to work on for the first unit
and we later found out that you know we got it but it was the for the movie was so
Ang was so focused on getting what he had in his mind and moving on to the next thing
that he just like wandered over back to his other set and kept working later to get the shot no I mean
we got it he watched it then he just we went but it was very anticlimactic for our team because we
were working so hard for we literally rebuilt the whole set around our grip process so that we
could move the camera through this space and then before you guys can even and then yeah knowing
knowing that you got it was him moving on to the next shot which is not unusual with
with sort of our tour directors that are just laser focused on on illustrating their vision
you also did spring breakers and the beach pump with Harmony Cree what was it like working with him
we're very fortunate to have a filmmaker like Harmony because he's one of those filmmakers
that I couldn't I didn't ask him this directly but he he has
you know edgy stories he wants to tell you know that deal with sex and drugs and
growing up and things that are awkward for people to deal with that are
right on the you know things that are not legal things that that a lot of people
and studios shy away from Harmony is fearless he takes it on the way he sees it
and just to be around filmmakers like that is fantastic because so much of our industry can
you know as at risk for getting watered down you know for commercial success I think he just
makes the film as he wants to make it and I feel really lucky to have been part of a couple of
his projects how close do you guys work together like how close do you guys communicate when you're
shooting I don't know how much of a movie you actually shot oh I didn't do very much for either
of his films just quick scenes there was a a two-on-one sex scene in a swimming pool and a
conversation in a swimming pool it's a handful of swimming pool scenes that I did in spring breakers
that had dialogue and some you know a sex scene with James Franco and Vanessa Hudgens and
and once I mean I feel very fortunate as a niche water specialist when my scene
even if it's a small scene for the film is usually super important or they wouldn't be
spending time putting people underwater bringing in my team and so in that moment the director is
you know he's working with me one-on-one to work through how to optimize the water for the shot
and it's very rewarding uh it's it's my favorite part of the job really is getting to meet these
super talented directors his vision is very pure in the sense that uh he's making he he aligns
himself with producers that allow him to make the film that he intends to make and and that's
really refreshing I just came off of a film uh from a filmmaker you you you probably won't
have heard of but you probably will in the future name Alejandro Landes a Colombian filmmaker who
made a film called Monos which is a teenage Colombian revolutionaries holding a a American
woman who's like an engineer hostage uh in Colombia and taking orders from like their
revolutionary sort of adult supervision and it's sort of a lord of the flies meets uh
very difficult political scenarios that exist in you know countries like Colombia that still have
ongoing battles between uh you know extreme extremists from both sides
and uh I think when you see this and they got this uh Mika Levy who's like super talented
DJ musician to do the score um I don't know if you've ever heard of a film called Under the Skin
it's a film that uh she did that she's the sound design and music it takes it into like it doesn't
feel like a story set in any particular time period it's very much a fable really really
wonderful and the locations are just stunning these mountaintops where you're up above the clouds
and they found and then there's a rapid river flowing through a really dense Colombian rainforest
it's really phenomenal locations to set this story another thing about and you mentioned the
soundtrack like when it comes to army's films the soundtracks did like some of the segments
were like music videos oh yeah it's like multiple music videos no string breakers was really
innovative that way super cool when I first started you know many years ago now I did
all documentaries uh and I did wildlife programs on sharks and alligators and
ecosystems and then I got into some shooting of commercials and IMAX films and then movies and
now because I really you know because I'm a water person I love the ocean I love
everything that lives in the ocean uh I don't a year doesn't go by that I don't contribute to
someone's documentary story that's taking on uh issues ranging from uh you know
acidification of the ocean from too much co2 to too much plastic entering the ocean I mean there's
always uh marine mammal captivity there's there's so many issues that are
important to me having grown up in the sea and most underwater filmmakers or underwater camera people
have a lot of
um
concern and almost sadness seeing how quickly things have changed and everyone feels responsible
to contribute to that uh if you have skills uh in media then you want to devote a certain amount
of your year uh to really using that to get the message out of things that uh you know media for
change really can help change thanks for the better
I always have used the mangroves as sort of like uh
I mean from a practical standpoint it's kind of like a good testing ground for like when I'm
looking at new cameras and lenses and equipment right it's always been sort of like a
like a meditative space for me mangroves it's like uh it's like a default place I go to be
like when I'm not sure what I'm going to be doing next like just to go it's like in a way it's
like my nursery ground like they always talk about the mangroves as a nursery ground for fish because
you know there's baby snapper and lobster and and grouper and all those little things in there
but I grew up snorkeling around the mangroves and if I have any kind of underwater homing instinct
it's to the mangroves really yeah like I grew up learning like and the spookiest thing that you
ever see when you're a child is swimming underneath the roots in the darkness and a light shaft
revealing like a giant snapper face with teeth so like my earliest childhood memories of like
dealing with the mystery and unknown of being underwater is being in that sort of dark
light shaft lit environment of the mangroves where you never knew which face would appear
and it's gotten even more interesting now because when I was a kid you know there were only 200
american crocodiles crocodiles need to have like a beach that's undisturbed to to feel confident
nesting and laying eggs okay so they created that down in the turkey point power plant and
and as a result the crocodiles have come back you know uh I don't know how dangerous they would be
for people uh obviously I would give them respect because you know a big crocodile is is a big
crocodile yeah I mean it's a crocodile right so they're moving both directions they're coming
my way and your way on the west coast of Florida as well I'm sure you're gonna start seeing crocodiles
up where you live at some point and there could be a crocodile here
you know when you you shoot for a really long time you do tend to like you know maybe
depending on your definition but you maybe do too much of it especially if you're
you know doing it fully it starts as a hobby and becomes a profession you're shooting all the time
so yeah I like I'd love to jump in the water with nothing in my hand and I do do that and uh
and some of my best experiences have been doing that um
but the the balance it's always a balancing like how much of what you're doing that you enjoy doing
but in the last year and a half uh I was shooting like five days a week for 14 months straight
for a great project but someone else's project right so when I had some time off uh I was sort
of torn between just not touching a camera because I had a camera in my hand so much
or just craving like doing some photography that got me invested in you know in some of my own
like full creative freedom yeah just to have creative freedom and do my own thing because I'm
you know I'm very loyal like as a as a crew person I you know like I serve the the artour like if
there's a director I'm all like I don't do anything but think about how to make that movie better when
I'm on it okay I don't take like nothing's for me it's all for like making the movie better and if
you don't have that attitude you're like it's so it's so hard to make great stuff with collaborative
projects like that you got to be like all in so when I get off yeah yeah you've got it's got to
be all about the movie or the director's vision anything else you know you shouldn't you shouldn't
have the job right I mean in my mind right um so when I get a day a week off and even the weekends
you're kind of still thinking about what you could do next week to make the week go better
so like now that I've had a few weeks off I went to Columbia with my family I brought a camera and
then there's a few times I was really glad I had it you know like just like coming around a corner
of mangroves and there was a giant waterfall yeah and I was like this is nice I'm never going to be
here again it's nice to capture it yeah experience it too but you I was just going to show you a
picture like years ago when I was doing a film on a humpback humpback whales and Tahiti like you
said like you know sometimes you need to have that experience also it's good for you as a filmmaker
to to see things a little bit you know differently without the equipment right right and I told my
still photographer Tim Calver who was with me yeah Tim I remember Tim I was like
I don't know if people really understand like the scale of a whale and he was like of course
everybody knows how big whales are I know you but you know this whale was hanging out waiting for her
baby was nursing she was in like 60 feet of water the baby was at the surface just going up and down
she was very chill she was already kind of accustomed to us being around we weren't bothering her
and I and I and I did that picture Tim shot that of me just like taking in the mom
of the whale mom waiting for the baby how deep are you right right maybe like between 60 and 70 feet
but it's good for scale because there's no force perspective I'm just right in front of the whale
and you can see exactly how big a whale is compared to a human
and let's see what the water feels like I haven't been in the water here in a while
yeah it gets so warm I think that's one of the uh the things about Florida
creating a lot of like lifelong water people in different I mean like when you if you if you travel
a lot in California and Hawaii or Tahiti where people grow up in giant surf right right when
you're from Florida and you surf you get a lot of razing like is there even surf in Florida right
and you know arguably compare those places there isn't really but people like Kelly Slater and you
know there's a handful of people we could list that have come out of Florida and gotten really into
it I think the warm water is a factor and maybe uh like people spend more time in the water when
they're really little in Florida yeah because it's like easier whereas like in in California
or Hawaii like it's so hard core that only like the people who are really brought into it by
super season people get exposed to whereas in Florida like many more people get into the
water very young because it's so soothing this area I've seen giant sharks out there
oh yeah there isn't here on these flats even yeah any side shark could be in these walls
how did you meet riko berry and getting involved with uh well interestingly uh when I was a
a young child riko berry was doing um his first research project said mashed a point which is right
behind us here or actually in off in the distance there and they after he left the aquarium uh
they were he was sort of I think in his sort of formative years where he really realized
he was headed towards a life of commitment to activism to to keep animals out of
captivity dolphins and and whales and orcas yeah he was he was he was a sea aquarium dolphin
trainer and handler and you know maintaining those tanks and things and then that led to
working for riko browning who was the head of all the marine operations and dolphin training
and performances for the flipper tv series many years ago and rick I think was uh very
fortunate to go along for the ride with riko browning you know who was very seasoned uh
at dealing with filmmaking and and wildlife and I think rick sort of learned the ropes of that
but then uh as time went on I think he kind of saw a darker side to what animals that are
performing for our entertainment uh what what really exists there is you know animals that are
doing work for food uh and not always uh happily the way they might appear because
that you know dolphins dolphins look like they're smiling all the time which is sort of you know
a a curse to the way their face is shaped compared to how we view that but rick was very committed
to that and um actually the way I met him was really uh quite close to here uh a a cove away
from here I was making my first documentary called uh about bis game bay about the bay
that we're sitting in right now okay and it was I was doing a film about the history of
bis game bay and the current state of ecology and I and I was filming some rays and some schools of
fish about half a mile from here and all of a sudden there's a dolphin in my lens right up
against me looking at me right into my lens and I'm in murky water so it was a little stunning
actually it was a little scary because his big animal with his eyeball right up to me
and then he left and he came back with a sea turtle underneath his neck and he was like
guiding it along and then he like pulled it pushed it up to my lens and kind of spun it around right
in front of my lens and then stared at me like what do you think of that and I was like what's
going on here like this is amazing I can't believe I'm getting this footage like I was
thought I was having this breakthrough moment with dolphins and uh so I stayed in this cove
for like three days and the dolphins were letting me film them every day and I was like this is
crazy and then all of a sudden someone you know started talking to me and they made a phone call
and it turned out these dolphins had like escaped from ocean reef club and maybe rickle berry had
something to do about it I'm not really sure so they were like trained they were like dolphins
that had been in captivity that were like out in the wild and I just stumbled into them I was
I had encountered them no one really knew where they were and then when someone talked to me about
what I was doing they called someone who knew about it and all of a sudden like the world
descended upon my little this game bay documentary wow rick trout showed up rickle berry showed up
like five different dolphin activists showed up and then the people from ocean reef showed up and
then they hired a big like old school dolphin capture team that they imported from mobile
alabama that had big nets and lobster boats and I was in the middle of it all and I was you know I
was in my 20s so I was kind of fearless at that time and I wasn't afraid of legal things uh at
that point in my life without having children or any response you know ownership of anything
and at one point I had like the dolphins behind my boat and we were like tossing them fish to lure
them away from the capture boats and I was like on the nightly news it was kind of a crazy thing
anyway rick and I chatted and then he invited me down to go film with him when he released some
dolphins that were sort of like a I think they had done some military work of some kind I'm not
sure their background but I filmed him releasing some dolphins down near Key West I think right and
it was like clandestine totally probably illegal I guess because he was ducking for cover at every
turn and then it was right or wrong it was very exciting for me and uh some of that footage ended
up getting licensed and used in the cove which is the movie about the taiji the Japanese taiji
cove killing cove and um in the backstory of rick o barry and how he came to be an activist to try
and stop the killing cove they used some of that footage from that first clandestine mission I went
on with him like movies like like the cove and blood dolphin like that shit is so terrible it makes
your blood blood watch me it's just so sick that was probably about 10 years ago until today has
anything changed with that yeah uh I mean yes and no so there you know rick o barry and his son
lincoln they're very much going after every single dolphin in captivity basically yeah so they they
pretty much pride themselves on having a database of almost every dolphin where it is and where it
came from and what are the challenges to try and get it free and some of them some of some of them
yeah yeah and he you know he's get at a point in his life where he doesn't give a fuck right he'll
make enemies he'll cross he's like a vigilante yeah he is a vigilante and you know he has a
reputation that some people you know don't care for him even on the activist side because he's not
afraid to to cross boundaries and hurt people's feelings uh he's he's you know he's he is yeah
definitely kind of a vigilante and there's dolphins he can't save like uh dolphins that are
damaged or dolphins that are in like he was trying to get these dolphins out of egypt and there became
a lot of dangerous elements to it that were life threatening for the people the activists on the
ground and he had to pull out there's things he tries for that are frustrating you know
death threats lawsuits all the time i mean you know that's a tough road to hoe to be a full-time
activist and going after you know a lot of these dolphin areas these dolphin zoos they're run by
giant corporations you know with lots of power and influence so you know that's those are tough
people to go against shooting documentaries and shooting movies so that's so such a different
such a different world a lot of times when i'm underwater and i'm shooting stuff even with the
gopro i kind of i get lost like when i'm trying to film something or chase a fish like i'll get
lost in the shot that i'm trying to get yeah i'll forget about my surroundings yeah get about like
when i was in i was in the cayman island you don't want to make a kilfee right like a what a
kilfee a kilfee yeah what's that you know those people who keep like they're doing a selfie and
they fall off the cliff and they die there's like a whole series of like there's like 20 something
deaths a year now that's a thing yeah that's totally a thing oh my god so when you brought that up i
thought well you're talking about there's all these people who died doing selfies but you're
talking about just getting so caught up in the shot that other things are happening around that you
know that maybe you needed more eyes in your head right like i've heard about yeah a war a guy who
did a war documentary it was like in the middle of a firefight oh yeah and he just like completely
was not even worried about his safety bullets oh yeah he's only worried about the game shot
and he realized afterwards like holy fuck what was i doing no when i first started in this business
my first like five years of underwater filmmaking were like 20 shark films in a row so when uh
sharks you know for the most part don't really bite people i mean you hear of the bites and
they're super sensationalized because it's it's terrifying to think of something an animal biting
us and maiming us or killing us but the truth is like so few people are bitten by sharks that
statistically it's not it's not really a thing it's just scary to think about but when you're
working with sharks you're asked to swim close to sharks like while they're doing feeding behaviors
uh your your your odds go upright of them maybe having a bad encounter and so in the years that
you know i've been working i i've seen some terrible things happen i've seen some accidents
happen and i've had a couple of close calls but to speak to your question of being caught up in
the moment i was doing a scene in uh into the blue which was like an underwater treasure story with
paul walker and jessica alba it's you know it was a teenage thrill movie it was a fun movie
not a huge box office success but a lot of water people can appreciate it because there
was a lot of time hunting for things underwater and it was fun if you like being underwater
and there was a scene where we were filming these sharks like mauling this guy right and we had a
guy in chainmail in a in a feeding scenario where sharks were ramming into him and it was pretty
chaotic and i might have really good safety divers around me that are watching so the shark
doesn't get overly curious about my rig or my camera and they might be you know redirecting a
shark or like just like getting me to become aware of a shark just so i know where it's coming from
and at one point i was like they were pulling me backwards away from the scene i was like
well i'm like i'm getting a great shot why are they pulling me backwards and uh then when we came
up from the dive they were like man i can't believe how you just stayed composed on the scene while
that shark was like dragging you away and i had like a i had chainmail legs and arms and i had
booties over my chainmail and the shark bit my heel and bit like the hard parts of the booty and
was like tugging me away from the scene but i never felt it really i just felt pressure
because the sharks you know for that type of shark works so i they thought i was being super cool
i probably if i had looked back might not have been so cool right because it was you know there
were substantial sharks but um so yeah i was maybe overly caught up in the moment but yeah what happened
to me was i was on the on the caiman wall scuba diving through like the caves down there and
there's like these caves you swim through and you it's it's a while before you can find an opening
yeah i am familiar with them and i was i wasn't paying attention to my hair at all the whole
time i had a guy with me like guiding me and he was like checking my hair yeah and some of those caves
exit deep yeah and we're like deep we're probably a hundred feet down yeah maybe 90 feet down and
all of a sudden i'm out of air oh my goodness and i'm looking at my gauge i got nowhere i look at
the guy that's like 10 feet in front of me i'm like like that and he had to give me his octopus
and i started shooting up to the surface and grabbing by my ankle so i didn't shoot up
you probably saved your life i would have probably died or got the pens really bad you might be
paralyzed right now that was like i mean that was yeah i've worse experience of that yeah i've seen
a few people get bent bad and it's it's really bad if money wasn't an object and you can shoot
anything you wanted and and you have i guess if you had all the money in the world you'd have to
worry about ever working for money what would you shoot what's your favorite thing to shoot well
that's an interesting question i think would it be documentaries or would it be feature films oh it
would be it would not be one thing only i mean there's definitely things i like about all the
different film i mean i certainly would put some time into doing documentaries to to get
the message out about certain sensitive wildlife situations that are close to my heart
you know right now everybody all the filmmakers are super focused on plastic going in the ocean
so that's not you know we can't ignore that at all but uh you know probably some stories locally
i go after i mean all the things that i would do if i had all the money in the world i'm kind of doing
uh there's a there's a couple of stories that i've wanted to tell some films that i've wanted
to make that i've been starting to shoot tests for on the side that are clearly my dream project that
are there it's a science fiction story that would uh take advantage of incredible wildlife
things that i've learned how to film and some fantastic freediver friends of mine that
i've developed a relationship with how to move through the water and get shots that are difficult
to get like uh for example william truebridge who is uh you know one of the top freedivers in the
world still probably holds the record for swimming with no equipment to depth you know he swims like
uh you know like 340 something feet with no fins weight mask just a speedo and he swims 340 something
feet you know down and up and like a handful of freedivers and some of his friends that i've
gotten to know i have a science fiction story that would be centered around this group of divers
in the water that i've been wanting to tell for a while that i'm starting to accumulate some pieces
to do my sort of uh sizzle cell thing i'm hoping to hit up some of the many producers and directors
that i've gotten relationships to hopefully uh you know um i'll get some support that i'm looking for
and then if i don't then i'll have to i'll have to only do it if i get to where you said where i
have all the money and i don't have to worry about it what advice would you have to some to a kid
in today's world coming up in media and filmmaking and with everything on the internet you know
that's when you started when you you uh you you asked me that question before and i hadn't
have an answer right away and i thought about it a little bit and i've been asked that before because
i'm doing something that i dreamed of doing and i'm doing it now and i'm making a living i'm
supporting my wife and and kids well i'm not necessarily supporting them but i'm able to
contribute to a healthy household that you know i'm doing it for a living and um
i thought i you know i'm i'm lucky i'm lucky i have this job but whenever people ask me like
about what would someone that's getting into it now do it's so it's so different when i started
working in the industry you know i had to find ways to be able to afford a roll of 16 millimeter film
and process it i sometimes shot a roll of film and even though you shouldn't sit on an exposed
roll of film i couldn't afford to get it processed right away or i sent it to the lab and i couldn't
afford to get it out of the lab because i didn't have enough money to get it out of the lab the idea
that you can go out with your iphone or you know if you have more of a budget to go out with these
dslr's or mirrorless systems now that that that are making images with more resolution than
film did back when we were working it's phenomenal like so many people can just go make a film now
we had we had so many obstacles financially to making a film then and if you chose to do it the
sort of gorilla low budget route you know you were shooting on you know three quarter umatic
cassettes i mean we had the quality was so much less and the gear was so much heavier and even to
get decent you it was like now everyone can make a film and they can have they have social media
they have youtube channels there's so many great avenues and outlets you know for for showing your
work that i'm not sure i'm equipped to guide somebody in terms of how to make a career out
of it but i do feel like i am in touch with a few basic principles which is you know don't lose
sight of like the reasons you're making films the story that you're telling is your unique vision
and how you get there there are many different paths but i feel like a lot of people make the
mistake of trying to like immediately work on commercial projects and learn the ropes of commercial
filmmaking when and and then a few years go by and all of a sudden they have a commercial films that
make money so like you can make a film that goes on social media doesn't necessarily have a clear
path to making money so if you're making a film that's you know already has a distribution or
like now i would think you would want to make films and get them out there and and you know
learn your craft your storytelling craft with feedback from your peers through social media or
or like to me it's the no time is better than now to like be able to make films because equipment
is just phenomenal you can make films for free there's so many different routes to getting to
where you're trying to go
