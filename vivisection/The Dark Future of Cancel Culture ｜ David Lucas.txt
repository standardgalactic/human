Hello world.
My guest today is David Lucas.
David is a comic based in Los Angeles and he also works at the comedy store on the
Sunset Strip.
He's a regular on the number one live comedy podcast called Kill Tony with Tony Hinchcliffe
and he's featured on Brothers in Cursive, which is a podcast produced by Brian Redband
who is the guy who started or helped start the Joe Rogan podcast.
This podcast is rated XXL, not only for the foul language, but David is a big old country
boy from the South.
Without further ado, please enjoy this hilarious podcast with David Lucas.
Woo, we're live.
What up?
David Lucas is here from LA.
What's going on man?
How are you?
Shit.
How was your trip here?
I had a layover.
I was tired as a bitch when I got off the plane.
So you didn't really fly spirit?
Nah, I didn't fly spirit.
That's what I like to say.
So people, you know, I ain't want people in Florida to know that I'm sitting my balling.
So last night when we went to your set at the sidesplitters in Tampa, that was like my
second ever comedy show I've ever been to.
They got some heavy hit.
I don't know if it's because of COVID or if he's out here really like paying people
and like, you know, probably laundering money on the low.
Yeah, the dude was telling me that Mick Foley is coming there, the wrestler with the sock.
Well, he does stand up.
I had no idea he would stand up.
Dude love.
Oh yeah, that was his other personality when he looked like a hippie.
Yeah, he was sick.
I don't, I don't necessarily, it's kind of like Stevo, you know, like once you develop
like a character and people are familiar with it, I won't say they're doing stand up, they're
just up there like pandering to the audience, kind of like what Mike Tyson did with his
little travel one man show is like you get up there and you know, you know, as long as
you're interested, people will pay to keep seeing that shit.
Like I pay to see Mike Tyson's story live.
Hell yeah.
Definitely.
Yeah, I guess if you're big enough name anyone will come to come just listen to you talk
shit about shit you've done in your life and all the dumb shit you've done like Stevo.
Yeah, for sure.
People will come.
Hell yeah.
So what's LA like right now?
What's it like living in LA with everything shut down and I know you work at the comedy
store, right?
Yeah, it's shitty right now, bro.
It's a liberalized city that's going to hell slowly.
I live in a nice neighborhood bro and since quarantine like homeless people have taken
over like just taking our sidewalks over.
So I'm like, I don't know where this is going, but in the next two years I want to get the
fuck out man because it's like you pay all this money to live in a certain area and then
like one block away you got a fucking homeless camp like.
But the homeless people have always been on the streets out there.
Yeah, but they were limited to certain areas, but I think they passed a law where it's like
you can't touch a homeless person's property anymore.
Like police can't.
So yeah, it's getting like real bad out there.
So our cities, like I've been there 10 years, man.
I've been there my whole adult life, my whole adult life and I moved there when I was a
teenager.
So I've seen it like as his best and then like slowly, you know, decrease and go to shit.
Like I used to live downtown man and I moved from downtown LA because like who wants to
wake up in the morning and smell fresh pee?
You know what I'm saying?
Feel that.
God damn.
Who wants to wake up and smell hot piss on a food?
Oh fuck.
And makes with the heat is just overwhelming, man.
Yeah.
Didn't you say you're half Cuban or what?
My dad's Cuban, man.
Born in Cuba, bro.
Really?
Yeah.
Half Cuban, bro.
Is that where you get the conservative side of you?
Nagado Cubano.
Probably.
Because a lot of Cubans are Republicans.
Really?
You know, I grew up in Georgia for a majority of my life and I mean Republican or Democrat
though.
The Democrats ain't countering and you know, Trump gave us $1,200.
Yeah.
So he sponsored three pair of Yeezus for me.
Fuck yeah.
Forever be my favorite president until somebody is like, hey, match it.
Match it.
That's all I want.
Biting where you at.
You on the clock, bro.
You see nothing.
You know what I'm saying?
If he matches it, is it good or is he going to go bigger?
He's going to have to go bigger.
Bigger.
A lot bigger because, you know, Biden, that's crime bill, Biden, you know what I'm saying?
With Kamala Harris, who had two black guys on death row with insufficient DNA evidence
that she allowed to perish.
So that's true.
So double, does double cover it?
I probably need like 7,200 from Biden.
7,200 from Biden.
Like, you know, people always be like, Trump's races and I'm like, motherfucker, I like my
racism with tangibles.
Yeah.
Racists call me a nigger and they give me a check for 1200.
I be like, bro, that even wasn't that bad.
I've been called.
Yeah.
Worse.
See you next week.
You know what I'm saying?
I wouldn't even be mad.
You know?
Oh, my God.
Yeah, man.
As long as I'm getting tangible shit, man, continue to treat me racist.
That's all I want.
Yeah.
I mean, in the industry, dog, you know, like, in the entertainment industry, you know, that's
why a lot of people and y'all are on y'all independent wave, like even look at it now
with Joe Rogan being on Spotify in this past week.
He apologized.
You ever seen Joe Rogan apologize for saying something?
Where do you apologize for that?
On Instagram, because I guess, you know, when you when you Joe Rogan has spoken probably
what, 30,000, 40,000 hours on podcast, so are we really lagging pretty hard?
Are we on the stream?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Fuck it.
We're recording.
Are we really checking the validity of everything a podcaster says, like, I'm not going to
do anything on the Joe Rogan for my news.
So it's like, it's entertainment.
You know what I'm saying?
It's entertainment.
Right.
So it's like he apologized for something he said on his podcast and he was like, I didn't
fact check it all the way.
I just basically blurted out what I saw in an article and my apologies about that.
But it's like, once you go to the machine, they start fact checking everything.
Right.
Now you got to apologize for everything.
He's never done anything before.
I've never done anything like that.
What was it about?
You remember?
He had to pull up his ID.
Yeah.
I don't really remember.
I think it was something to do because he's on Spotify now that they made him apologize.
Absolutely.
That's what it's about.
Yeah.
You know, they're like, hey, man, we can't have that.
Yeah.
We can't have that, man.
We already, that $100 million check already cleared.
So it's like, once you do that, bro, like now you're watering down what Joe Rogan is.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
It's like that.
Right.
Now you're censoring him.
Right.
So it's like.
Do you get to watch him a lot at the comedy store?
Absolutely.
Oh, yeah.
That's anybody.
I've met him, talked to him, probably got drunk with him, probably got offered drugs
from him.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
But Joe Rogan's on them.
He's on a different level, bro.
You know Joe Rogan do stuff like what?
Iowa school and DMT.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm not with that shit, bro.
At life altering shit.
I'm scared of DMT, but yeah, I mean.
It shouldn't be.
I'll probably do that shit when I'm like 45, 50.
How old are you now?
About to be 30 this year, man.
Wow.
Damn.
I'm still young.
Hell yeah.
30's is when it gets good.
I heard.
I heard, man.
I heard.
I'll probably be looking for a wife in like another 10 years.
Another 10?
You know, you don't really want to.
At 40?
Yeah.
I don't want to get married until my dick stops getting hard on command.
You know what I'm saying?
On command?
You can just sit here and like.
Like a girl can come touch my knee and I'm going to get a heart on.
So when that stops happening, I'll get married.
I'm going to settle down.
Yeah.
Time to hang it up.
Time to lock one up.
Yeah.
Time to top out.
All right.
Yeah.
Like, you know, a girl come rub me on my shoulder.
I'm like, hey, don't do that.
Don't do that, Shawty.
You just started something.
So I was like, as long as that's still happening.
I mean, if that goes away in like four years, I'll be like, all right, it's time for me to
get a wife.
All right, yeah.
But as of now, man, it's like, I'm an entertainer.
I'm climbing the ladder of success.
Yeah.
And you know, my projection is looking great.
Hell yeah.
You're on the rise.
Yeah.
In LA, bro, it's hard to, like, stay committed because in LA, like, you got to think, like,
LA is the mecca of, like, LA in Miami, mecca of the term, you know, bad bitches.
So it's like, bad bitches from all over the world fly to these cities to establish themselves.
So it's like, we got bad bitches that work at Wendy's, at the Gaston's, Burger King,
bad bitches on the bus.
So it's like, there's no problem getting a bad bitch in LA.
It's like, when you got girls that are lesser than you with money and you out here and you
in, like, the limelight, it's like, in LA, everybody's attracted to what they see.
That's why everybody, you know, drives fancy cars.
Yeah, you know, they put the jury on.
But I'm playing, you know, like, you see, you won't know.
If you didn't know me, you'd be like, he might or might not.
You know what I'm saying?
But that's how I like to be, like, a little inconspicuous.
But a lot of girls are attracted to what they see.
So it's like, if they see you, like, in the limelight or, oh, damn, he really got power over here
or, damn, he really on that show.
Like, that's what they're attracted to.
They're attracted to what you are and not, like, who you are.
So it makes it, like, real difficult to date out there when you're trying not to attract the wrong thing.
So, because I swear, man, the last thing I want to do is get married and end up like Dr. Dre.
Oh, she's coming hard for him.
What happened to Dr. Dre?
I don't even know about that.
She's getting divorced.
She's trying to take a lot of shit.
Are you able to pull up, type in Dr. Dre's divorce, his wife's list of expenses.
This bitch wants $2 million a month.
What?
And her expenses are ridiculous.
Like, she wants $30,000 for emails and telephone expenses.
Oh, I think I did see that.
She's trying to take, like, half of his trademarks of Dr. Dre name.
Can you read some of those?
So we got laundry and cleaning, $10,000 a month.
Clothes, $135,000 a month.
How much?
Education.
$135,000.
Clothes?
Yes.
A month?
Yes.
That's a lifetime.
God, I'm beyond a supreme man.
I'm so fast.
You lose it so quick.
Education, $60,000 a month.
Entertainment, $900,000 a month.
What are you doing?
Be entertained for $900,000 a month.
That's what, $3,000 a night?
Is that $3,000 a night?
That sounds right.
$9,000 a month?
I don't know.
No, $900,000.
$900 a month?
$900,000 a month for entertainment.
But, you know, to back it up and to make it seem like she's a good person, she has charitable
contributions at $125,000 a month.
That would be her fucking alimony, the charitable contributions.
To the kids?
Mortgage, $100,000.
That's $30,000 a night.
$30,000 a day for $900,000 a month.
So her entertainment is $30,000 a day.
Yeah, that's what we're talking about.
What could you get for $30,000 a night?
And a $20,000 phone bill.
$20,000 a phone bill?
God, phones jumping.
This must have got a satellite phone.
Holy shit.
It's a Gucci phone.
That's off-white, bro.
Yeah, that's the new virtual phone.
Chee-chee!
Off-white, right?
Oh, he's got an off-white belt.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that bitch out of her fucking mouth.
We should have brought Tifu out here with his Louis Vuitton coffin.
Tifu?
The rapper?
He's a gamer.
He's a Fortnite player.
Tifu just sounds like a rapper name.
You ever play Fortnite?
No, do I look gay?
This kid plays Fortnite, and he makes all this money, and he bought a Louis Vuitton Supreme coffin.
Yeah, and if he falls down, he'll probably break every bone in his body.
He probably looks fragile.
No, he doesn't.
He actually just started working out.
Show him a picture of him.
Wait till you see this kid.
Fortnite's awesome.
He started working out like three months ago.
He's making crazy money.
Yeah, he probably does.
Oh, look at this motherfucker.
He'll kill somebody soon.
He'll kill somebody.
He'll kill somebody soon.
Yeah, another fucking Jake Logan ripoff.
Yeah, he looks just like Jake Logan Paul.
All these motherfuckers, bro.
I'm sick of it, bro.
You make money on the game.
I don't respect you, though.
Yeah, yeah.
On the game?
Yeah, on the game.
Oh, and they sit on the game.
You make money playing video games.
Get the fuck out of here.
Do some respectable shit.
Don't rob somebody.
I respect you more than that.
Knock a motherfucker out.
Do struggle or bribery.
I respect you more, dog.
What's your name?
I mean, get it how you live, though.
I ain't got nothing to say.
I don't care.
I don't care.
Good boy, dog.
What's your name?
I mean, get it how you live, though.
I ain't hatin', but you know.
Yeah, he is making crazy money, man.
But he played it.
He played the game for so long.
He played those video games in his room for so long, making no money.
Never had a job.
Like, never did anything else.
And made, he went from literally zero to making, like, probably almost a million bucks a month
in, like, a span of three months.
I'm proud of him, dog.
I'm proud of him.
It's crazy.
It's crazy.
You can make that kind of money from video games.
I thought that, you know.
But it's only, like, him and that dude, Ninja, who are the only dudes making that much.
You know, be the outliers.
He sacrificed not getting a lot of pussy to be a fuckin' master at a video game.
He's got a lot of pussy coming at him now.
Yeah.
Yeah, but he probably don't even know how to fuck correctly.
You know what I'm saying?
He probably grabbing a girl like a remote control or shit, like a pressing A on her clip.
Probably right.
Double.
That's stupid.
Probably right.
Probably right.
Yeah, bro.
Fuck that, man.
Oh, my God, dude.
I got a cousin who plays video games, like all that twitching shit.
Yeah.
I don't fuck with him, bro.
He lives on a sailboat in front of Dina.
In front of where?
In front of Dina.
In front of the beach.
Oh, okay.
Jacksonville Island.
Oh, okay, okay, okay.
Yeah, he's a weirdo.
Fuck, he's playing video games on a sailboat.
Streaming on a sailboat?
Yeah, bro.
He's a weirdo, bro.
What the fuck?
Nobody in the family fucks with him.
Is that guy?
That's why he's on a boat.
Jacksonville of all places.
How do you end up there?
Duval.
I mean, you know, the family from Florida.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
He's in front of Dina.
It's not far from Jacksonville.
It's a nice area.
You know what I'm saying?
Kind of like, was it Seminole right here?
Yeah, it's Seminole, yeah.
Something like that, yeah.
Okay.
But I don't know.
I don't even really, I gave my video game system away to my little brother like three
years old and just like totally committed myself to women and entertainment.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
If I'm gonna be busy, it's gonna be either.
Do they go hand in hand women in entertainment?
Nah, bro.
It's the opposite.
Really?
Every girl wants an entertainer, but every girl can't handle an entertainer.
Because most girls in L.A. are either used to dating a guy who's already on, who has
money, or a guy building up.
A lot of girls are not used to like dating an entertainer that's like, I mean not building
up, but a guy who doesn't have it yet.
A lot of girls are not used to dating guys that are like right in the middle to where
they're just like, I still gotta work my ass off, but I make okay money, but I'm not
like balling yet.
So I'm busy as fuck because I gotta have my hand in this, my hand in that.
I gotta fly there.
I gotta fly to this city.
I feature for this comedian.
I'm not headlining.
I'm not really making my own schedule yet.
So you know, I'll tell a girl like, look, I'm busy as shit.
Like whatever guy you've ever dated, like multiply his busy times two.
The idea lasts for about three months and then they're like, you never make time for
me.
Like I told you, I told you what the fuck was up.
You know what I'm saying?
Like you can't like try to make me pick.
It's not going to happen because I'm always choose my career because I left my whole
family to be out here.
I've lost three close relatives since I've been out here, so I'll never pick you over
my career.
Right.
Right.
But they always forget about that three months in and it's always about two, three months.
What about bring her with you?
For what?
That's a lot.
That's a lot of money in plane tickets.
Right.
When you swim, you take a bottle of water inside the pool with you.
I already knew the answer.
I get myself a little more wet even though I'm in water.
I'm going to pour a little bit of water on me because I don't think this water is fulfilling
enough.
Oh my God.
Well, yeah, it seems like a lot of those guys out there who are in entertainment business,
whether it's like comedy or whether they're YouTubers, they always have all kinds of fucking
girl drama.
They're always surrounded in it.
Like you were talking about like what's that guy, Chris Delia or Brian Callan getting involved
in all that.
All these guys, no matter how old they are, the old dudes and the young guys, they're
always just surrounded in like women drama.
So here's the thing.
Here's what I'll say.
The cleaner you are, the easier it is for the masses to accept that you did something
fucked up.
You know what I'm saying?
The dirtier you are, it's hard for somebody to try to put an allegation on you.
Bill Cosby and Chris Delia are probably the two hardest hit ever in the history of comedy.
And they're damn near squeaky clean.
Chris Delia states he don't drink on stage, he don't smoke weed, and he don't curse that
much.
Bill Cosby hated cursing.
So if you hear anything atrocious towards these guys, you're like, oh my God, they're
fucking monsters.
Could you imagine somebody trying to pull that with like a Cat Williams, a Patrice O'Neill,
or somebody like that who tells you they ain't shit up front in their asshole?
It's like you already kind of know, like you really thought you were going to get treated
well with this guy, and he told you up front that he's an asshole.
That's how I view it.
The cleaner you are, it's easy for someone to make you fall, or easy for an allegation
to take you down.
The people who are straight up like, look, I'm a piece of shit, and they talk about
it, and they're the ones that don't really take the hard fall.
That's why Louis C.K. is able to tour right now.
You know what I'm saying?
He's not fucking squeaky clean on stage.
He said the N-word on stage, N-lived, so you don't think he can get past the fucking
jacking off on the phone while a girl is there type shit, you know what I'm saying?
Which is the dumbest shit, like, bitch, hang up the phone.
Yeah.
He jacked off while he was on the phone with me.
How do you know?
So what?
How do you know?
How do you know?
You know how many girls tell me they're fingering themselves while I talk to them on the phone?
And I'm like, FaceTime me, bitch, prove it.
I don't believe you.
Picture didn't exist.
I don't fucking believe you.
Oh, fuck.
Yeah, I'm such an asshole, and you know what I'm saying?
I text girls such atrocious things, and it's like, there's no way this motherfucker raped
you.
You're not worried about one day coming back and biting you in the ass, getting quote
unquote canceled?
I'd be like, pull up the text messages.
You saw this bitch said that I could come slap her with a piece of salmon before I fucked
her.
You think I raped that?
All right.
You know what I'm saying?
I text so much crazy shit to women, bro.
It's like, keep the text thread.
Read the whole text thread.
Don't pick and choose.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So what's the craziest thing that you're willing to disclose that you've texted someone?
Oh, shit.
Oh, my momma don't see this shit.
Get some ice.
Get some of this tequila.
You're going to need it after this story.
So there was this girl who said, who has a, oh god, I'm so disgusting for this.
There was this girl who likes to be mouthful.
I think I've had too much sex to the point where I'm desensitized to regular porn, so
I watch the most disgusting porn.
I watch ghetto gaggers.
So I don't know if y'all know what ghetto gaggers are.
What's ghetto gaggers?
No, I can imagine what that is.
An image is coming to mind, but I don't want you to go and do it.
It's a group of white guys who, it's a group of white guys who fuck like ghetto-looking
black chicks, but they fuck their like mouths to the point where like they throw up and
yeah.
What the fuck?
You watch that shit?
Yeah, bro.
Yeah, I do, bro.
Yeah.
So I told this girl I wanted to like put my dick down her throat until she started
throwing up.
Did you do it?
I did, but she didn't eat, so we didn't have really a problem.
We were just more like stomach fluid.
No actual flu.
A white girl?
Sick fuck.
Now she's not white.
She wasn't white.
She's a Filipino.
Okay.
God damn.
Yeah.
Puting animal to all my Filipinos out there.
What does that mean?
He should know.
I have no idea what it means.
She can't speak Filipino either.
Oh, you don't speak Tagalog?
He said she don't speak Filipino.
Jesus Christ.
It's Tagalog.
Oh, Tagalog.
Yeah.
I'm married to her and I forget that all the time.
Putain animal means like what's up motherfuckers, social like that.
Oh, really?
Fuckin' bitch or something like that.
How many languages you speak?
Fluently?
Yeah.
I don't even speak English fluently.
You just know the cuss words.
Right.
I can speak a little bit of like maybe like three, four languages a little bit, like a little
bit of German.
German?
Yeah.
How the hell did you learn that?
I was in Germany, dawg.
Really?
I learned a little bit, yeah.
How were you doing in Germany?
So when I was in college, I did a study abroad for like seven months where I went to Barcelona,
Bordeaux, France, and Geneva, Switzerland, and Germany.
Oh, that's cool as shit.
Yeah.
So, did that shit.
What were you studying?
Nothing.
Bitches.
Bitches?
Yeah.
I just went, bro.
Like literally...
They just let you go fly out there?
Good.
So I went on the school's budget, but then when we got there, I followed them, but I didn't
do none of the schoolwork.
Yeah.
Like what are y'all going to do?
Like kick me out while I'm here, bitches?
I was already...
Mall the way over here.
Yeah.
You know, so I just literally went to the cities with them, but I wasn't going to class.
That's cool as hell.
I was doing my own shit.
I was doing my own shit.
Bro, I also did some fucked up shit one time.
You're hot girls in Germany?
Yeah.
Really?
Tall bitches.
Oh, yeah.
Tall, manly bitches.
Okay.
I like a girl that can take a good fucking.
You know what I'm saying?
Okay.
Okay.
I bet you're going to need some weight on you to do this.
They jam a pint.
Let's go.
Yeah, bro.
300 pounds of pressure behind it.
But also there's a real fucked up shit, dawg.
I went on a mission trip with a church and we got to the country I left the ass.
So, where did you go?
Africa?
Damn.
What?
I made a mission to pay for being there every time, and I was like, yeah, I'm a volunteer.
Hell yeah.
I had already set up other travelers, I just wanted a free ticket, you know what I'm saying?
Oh, fuck.
What did they say anything?
What could they say?
I don't know, but did they?
Were they like, hey, man.
I'm gonna leave the Jesus anyway.
Oh, god.
I'm a Buddhist, nigga.
Fuck, you had your mission trip.
Hell yeah.
Oh, my god.
I'm like, bitch.
That's genius.
Bro, you were in Africa?
Yeah, I was in Africa.
Bro, I was in Africa.
Yeah, we flew into Senegal, and then we flew, no, we flew into Cameroon, excuse me, to
do some shit into Cameroon, and then I met a girl in Senegal, so I flew over to her.
But I just need to get to Africa.
Hell yeah.
They pay for all the shots and everything, dawg.
And then when, like, getting over there is expensive, but when you go over there, like,
I'm sure y'all travel internationally.
Like, it's cheap to go over there.
Travel internationally.
Like, it's cheap to go between, like, cities.
Right, once you're in Africa.
Yeah.
Like, 30, 40 bucks, American money, and you can get where you need to be.
Where is that?
Is that Southern Africa?
Senegal is West Africa.
Is it West?
I believe West Africa.
Yeah.
Okay.
Cameroon is East.
Can you fact check?
I don't know.
The only place I know in Africa, like, country is...
I don't want any trolls coming for me.
They're waiting.
They're waiting.
I got enough of those on my podcast, bro.
Like, not knowing Tagalog is going to come back at me in, like, five years when I'm doing
that stuff.
See?
He's ignorant.
See?
Bro, I am...
That looks like the...
Yeah, West Coast.
Yeah.
So Senegal is West Africa, right?
Or did I have it backwards?
I was going to look up map of Africa.
I believe Senegal...
Is it near Skeleton Bay?
Matt Cox is in the chat.
Is he really?
He said he likes the new setup.
Yeah.
The bookshelf.
The bookshelf.
The bookshelf is our new setup.
Hey, Matt Cox, you ain't got to come in but send your hairpiece in.
We'll send it on the shelf.
I'll interview your hairpiece, bro.
We were sitting at Waffle House last night.
That's all natural.
Bro, that shit is beautiful, y'all.
That's seven grand, that hairline.
Oh, yeah.
He said he needs another hit.
Yeah, he needs one more.
He's greedy because his hairline looks decent.
Hell, yeah.
Better than mine.
Huh?
Way better than mine.
Oh, yeah.
He's addicted.
French.
But if I did it wrong, the one is on West and the other is on the East.
Whatever it is.
However, I did it.
But, yeah.
Hmm.
Very East.
Very East.
So Senegal's on the East, Cameroon's on the West.
Is that how it goes?
Cameroon's on the West?
Cameroon's on the East, too.
Okay, so they both from the East.
Both on the East.
Different parts of the East.
Yeah.
Senegal, they speak French.
And Cameroon...
What do they speak over there?
I forget.
It was fun, though, bro.
Really?
How long were you there?
Like three weeks.
It flew back with they ass.
No fucking way.
What was that like when you met?
How did you meet back up with them and...
Because I had to go to the same airport.
The same flight?
Yeah, I was like, I did my own mission.
And nobody was like, where you been?
What they gonna do?
They church people, bro.
You know how forgiving...
They didn't say anything to you?
They just straight necked it.
You know how forgiving church people are?
Like, you know, oh, yeah.
We've all sinned and come short of the glory of God, brother.
I totally get it.
I'm on my own mission, bro.
I had to go sow my seed in synagogue.
That's awesome.
Yeah, bro, like...
Oh, fuck.
My own mission, bro.
You know what I'm saying?
So, yeah, that shit was fun as fuck, bro.
What was the coolest part about that area?
The women.
Really?
Was the food any good?
The food was all right.
You know what I'm saying?
What kind of food did they have?
Beans and shit.
Okay.
Yeah.
Beans, turnips, collards.
What's that plant that they chew there?
They, like, put it in their lip.
They're, like, addicted to it.
There's, like, a plant in East Africa that everybody eats,
especially in Somalia.
It's, like, really big in Somalia.
Is it beetle nut?
No.
It was...
That's...
Mm-mm.
I don't know what that one is, dawg.
I learned a lot when I was over there.
That was, like, what, eight?
What was it?
Nine years ago?
Eight, nine years ago?
Damn.
Yeah.
What's the difference between African women
and American women?
The submission.
Like, even if you meet a girl who was, like, raised over there
and moved over here, like, they're submission,
but, like, these American chicks, they be...
They're what?
The submission.
What's that?
How submissive they are.
Oh.
They're more submissive.
They're way more submissive.
Over there, right?
Over there.
Even a girl who was raised over there and moved over here,
as long as she's first-generation here and not second-generation.
That culture.
As long as she's not second-generation,
if she's first-generation, if she still has that culture
of being, like, submissive to her husband,
like, it's gonna be amazing, bro.
Like, I dated a Somalian girl who, like, braming my food,
rubbed my feet, like, fixed me with tea and shit,
but she was first-generation here, not second-generation.
And that's how the women were there.
They're, like, servers to their men.
It's like, you're their fucking king,
you know what I'm saying?
I feel like there'll be less...
Interesting.
I feel like there'll be way less divisive.
More women over here were like that,
and not trying to, like, one-up us.
Like, I feel like a lot of time, like, you know,
if you get into a fight with a chick,
especially if I'm petty, you know what I'm saying?
So a girl will try to, like, one-up you.
Well, don't forget you did this.
It's like, well, bitch, you know what I'm saying?
So it's like, if you try to one-up me,
I'm gonna try to one-up your ass.
Like, just fuck...
Like, I hate arguing.
I hate raising my voice.
I hate all that argument of shit.
So it's like, bro, just...
Can we just coexist?
Like, why do you try to make it so difficult?
Like, I feel like relationships over here
are so difficult, and women over there are just like,
oh, I fuck with you heavy.
So it's like, let me fix your food.
Let me rub your feet.
Like, dawg, I was at Nagasaki, Japan,
and a chick gave me a bath
that I had only known for, like, two days.
Yeah, just to show that she fuck with me heavy.
Gave me a whole bath.
So sick.
Yeah, bro.
So it's like, you know, it kind of fucks up dating
when you've been out in the country,
and you see how women are,
not knowing if you have $10,000 or $10 million in the bank
and how they treat you,
just based off of your personality or physicality.
And it's like, Goddamn.
I see why niggas be getting male or the brides.
Not white women.
Yeah, fuck white women, bro.
I don't know. Some of them are cool.
They got to have...
In order for me to fuck with a white chick,
she needs to be heavily tatted,
because, you know, like,
if a fucking Taylor Swift-ass white girl
gets mad at me and say some shit,
and my big tatted ass is just standing there,
you know, it's not good.
It's a liability.
Yeah, it's a...
So, like, balance it out a little bit.
Yeah, I need you to have, like,
at least have a neck tattoo
so that they can believe me as equally as...
One facetap.
Maybe a felony.
Yeah.
They need to believe me as much as they believe you.
It's like, they come see you with a neck tattoo.
It's like, oh, this bitch makes dumb decisions.
We've seen her before.
Yeah.
So, I'm curious.
So, they're more submissive there.
But here, women...
If you could put women on a scale
of personality traits,
or just, like, how they are,
from, let's say, making Georgia to L.A.,
what's the difference?
What's the spectrum?
Oh, bro, those chicks that moved to L.A.
have no fucking personality.
They have no culture.
You got to...
L.A. is a fucking stolen culture, bro.
There's no culture in L.A., you know what I'm saying?
Right.
I feel like L.A., people in L.A. in general,
is just, like, the epitome of, like,
the culture of people in the U.S.
Yeah.
In a way.
Like, it's just, like, the most intense...
You know, it's just, like, the most distilled...
version of what the U.S. culture is,
is, like, people in L.A.
And, like, the way people think and the way people, like...
It's very superficial, though.
The hierarchy.
It's very superficial.
Like, over in L.A.,
you'll meet people that own
Range Rovers and Lamborghinis that have roommates.
Right, they rent apartments, right?
That's how superficial...
That's how superficial...
Oh, it's over here, damn.
Yeah.
But I say girls over here have more, like, culture.
They have more personality.
Like, girls over there, you ask them,
what do you like?
I don't know.
Like, the beach.
Like, bitch, what?
Who don't like the beach?
Like, dude.
Like, what?
What are you saying right now?
They don't have no person...
They can't do shit, but look good, bro.
And it's, like...
Looks only last for, like, a month.
And after that,
like, I'm tired of this whole...
My uncle always told me, bro,
no matter how fine a girl is,
there's some nigga somewhere tired of that bitch.
And that's true facts, bro,
because, you know, like...
You know who has...
The baddest girls who have the best personality,
I would say, are either strippers or sex workers.
And I don't mind them.
Yeah.
Either one.
They have the most character.
They have a lot of character, a lot of personality.
Yeah.
I was talking to this girl.
She's a stripper,
and she was telling me how she was in a coat
until she was 20,
and she didn't lose her beauty until she was 21.
That's what happened to that girl
that dates the dude on Logan Paul's podcast.
What's her name?
Lana Rhodes.
You know what I'm talking about?
No.
She's a porn star,
and she was...
Same story.
She was in a cult when she was younger.
My first girlfriend in LA was a porn star.
Really?
Yeah, she helped me out a lot, bro.
I did a podcast with this chick who, like, studies porn,
and she studies, like, the negative effects of porn
and, like, how porn...
People in porn are treated badly or whatever.
She's probably ugly as fuck.
No, she's really good looking.
Really?
She's beautiful, yeah.
What's wrong with that bitch?
I don't know.
She's all about, like, just exposing the negative parts
of the porn industry, which, you know,
she's doing something.
She's trying to do good.
Because, you know, I don't agree with everything she says.
Most Karen's you see out here that are fighting.
Yeah, that's a very Karen thing, yeah.
Yeah, it's like, most of y'all are ugly.
It's like, bitch, I see why you mad.
That's why you're mad at fuckin' Stripper.
You're like fuckin' Holiday Ham, bitch.
Yeah, no, totally.
But I guess what we were talking about was,
I was like, the girls, a lot of girls or guys, whatever,
that end up in porn are there because they're desperate
to get away from something else.
Like, they're in a situation or they're like living in a home.
Sounds a lot like college to me, right?
They're getting abused by, like, whatever, family members.
They need to get the fuck away.
And the most convenient, obvious way to make money is like,
oh, I'm hot.
I can go do porn.
I make a shitload of money.
And I can be independent.
You're not focused on the abusive households
instead of the porn industry.
You know how many lies porn probably says?
A lot.
You know how many fuckin' teenage boys
that would probably shoot up a school
that they didn't have fuckin' porn?
They're probably right.
Exactly.
So it's like, for every negative,
you gotta think of the positive.
Pussy says lies.
Yeah, I totally agree with you.
There's definitely way,
I think there's probably a lot more
Yeah, bro.
Upside to porn than there's downside.
It's just like any addiction.
Exactly, bro.
You know, people need that.
Like, if it was not for porn, dog,
I would probably have slept with a lot of chicks
that I did not want to sleep with.
Yeah.
But it's like, I go put on a good porno.
It's like, oh, shit.
That's a really good point.
Let me tell this girl my story, Kirk.
Right.
Imagine all the fuckin' money you would have spent,
all the potential STDs you could have got,
possibly get someone pregnant.
Yeah.
Instead, just pull up a porno
and rub one out and be done with it.
That's why I've never been scared of coronavirus, though,
because I've been dodgin' STDs for like months.
Like, bro, like, I don't use condoms, period.
And I'm clean.
I hate condoms.
How do you avoid catching anything?
Pray to Buddha, nigga.
Just pray to Buddha.
Damn.
Put that positive energy into that atmosphere.
That's fuckin' crazy.
Put that positive energy.
Cross your fingers.
Yeah, bro.
I got him on my hand.
You know what I'm sayin'?
I got Buddha on my hand, so always finger girls with this.
Let him get a little taste first, and then...
If my stomach start hurting, then I won't fuck her.
You know what I'm sayin'?
So you light some incense and put some oranges next to it
before you go on?
No, I honestly finger girls with this hand with Buddha on it.
That's Buddha?
Yeah, that's Buddha.
That's one of the Buddha's.
Hold that up for the camera so we can see it.
I'm black.
I don't know if y'all can see this.
Yeah, we can see it.
It needs a couple more touch-ups.
Sick.
Finger girls with this hand, bro.
My enlightened Buddha.
Buddha.
So you're seriously...
And then you know...
Yeah, I'm a black Buddhist, though.
And you're seriously a black Buddhist Trump supporter?
I'm an independent.
Like I said, bro...
I was gonna say, that's a...
I'm all about tangibles, bro.
Right, for sure.
So it's like, if the Green Party or the fucking...
What is it?
The Libertarians.
If they got some shit that sounds good to me,
then I'm gonna go with them, bro.
But it's like...
People, like...
What's the chick that speaks for Trump?
Kayleigh?
You know the white chick Kayleigh?
Yeah, yeah, I know you're talking about.
The girl who walks out on everybody?
If he would allow her to do all his speeches,
America would love him.
Because he gets up there in freestyles.
He don't look at no reference cards.
You know, he starts out with the China virus.
Like, you know what I'm saying?
So he starts off wrong.
You know?
He don't know how to speak.
He don't know how to...
But he does, though.
He does.
That's the problem.
You know what I'm saying?
Like everybody knows somebody who has a great heart,
but they can't articulate very well.
You know what I'm saying?
And Trump is that nigga.
Like, that's my nigga, bro.
He got no problem with him.
He knows how to hit people.
The way he communicates, the one-liners that he has,
some of the shit he says,
those like trigger words that he uses,
he knows how to rile people up.
When people say they don't like Trump,
I'm like, you should just be glad you're in a country
that you can't speak out against your president.
Yeah.
Seriously, bro.
Because like...
Not China.
Like, you know what I'm saying?
Me having family in Cuba,
and I go down there and see him all the time,
and motherfuckers got to like Videl Castro or Raul
or who's the new one now?
I can't remember.
Whoever he is, you got to like him regardless.
You won't hear nobody speaking bad about them
because they know what time it is.
You know what I'm saying?
So it ain't none of that shit.
So y'all, like, there's a video going around right now
where it's like these Cubans went outside to protest
and within like 30 seconds of them protesting,
they started getting beat and locked up in Cuba, in Havana.
So it's like, you should be glad we live in a country
where you can go out there and protest
and you motherfuckers are looting and destroying shit
in the name of justice.
Yeah.
Or the injustice that has been...
You feel deemed that has been served towards us.
It's like, you should be glad we can even do this shit
without being shot.
And it's like the BLM people had the president of...
This is like, this is a total rant,
but like the BLM people had the president of Venezuela speak.
And it's like, this motherfucker kills protesters.
How the fuck...
Where do they have them speak?
They had them speak at one of their shits.
They like gave him an honor or a plaque or some shit.
Really?
Yeah, bro.
That's why it's like, I like the term black lives matter,
but that fucking organization,
I can't rock with it, dawg, as a black man.
As a black man, because it's like,
I don't know what the fuck y'all are doing,
but something ain't right.
Yeah, whoever started that website and owns that website,
they definitely have an agenda.
They definitely, they're doing something.
And it ain't for black lives.
I tell you, that shit.
I was arguing with this dude there,
and then he was talking about like,
he was saying the same thing.
And he was like, you look at all these,
like Tucker was saying,
he's like, look at these NBA players
with all these black lives matter signs on their jerseys.
They're just basically giving a big middle finger
to the rest of America,
all these dumb NBA players.
I'm like, you think these NBA players
are really thinking that much,
are really like that deep in black lives matter
of the organization?
No, they just...
They don't give a fuck.
It's a positive thing to say,
like black lives matter,
especially when there's, you know...
And I feel like they don't give a fuck, bro.
They're mostly 20, 21, 22-year-old kids.
And if you pay me 20, 30 million dollars a year,
I'll put on whatever fucking shirt you want.
Right, right, hell yeah.
If you put my mom's a hoe on the back of my drink,
I'm still playing basketball.
Because my mom lives in a nice house
and drives a nice car.
You think she give a fuck?
I totally get it, bro.
As a comedian, I try not to speak on politics too much,
because like a lot of people, like, I had a...
There was a time when, you know,
everything was going on and I was posting,
because I used to be very, very anti-Trump,
until, like, I'm talking about, like, hate Trump,
on the same emotional spectrum
that most black people hate Trump,
because they were raised voting Democratic.
You know what I'm saying?
They don't know any better.
It was like, why are you voting Democratic?
Well, my mom voted Democratic,
and Democrats are for the poor people.
And so, like, I hated Trump
up until the coronavirus, you know what I'm saying?
And when I actually had time to go and read his policies
and the tangibles that he's given people of color,
and I'm like, why the fuck do I hate this guy?
He doesn't know how to talk, yeah.
He comes out and says a lot of racist shit,
but what 70-year-old white man doesn't say racist shit?
My granddaddy said racist shit, you know what I'm saying?
So it's like...
That's true.
It's like, what do you expect from a person
that comes from that generation?
Yeah.
So I can't hate the guy.
You know what I'm saying?
I don't know.
Yeah, I totally agree with you, man.
It's like, bro, in the beginning of quarantine,
Trump's tried to stop all flights from China and Europe.
And he was like, no, that's racist.
So I was like...
In the WHO, I see why he defunded their ass,
because they said in February that there was no way
for the coronavirus to be passed from human to human.
It was only from animal to human transmission.
And we quickly found out that was a lie.
They had to get defunded.
I feel like this shit changes every week.
All the facts or whatever.
What was the shit that the CDC put up?
What was it?
A month ago, about only 6% of every coronavirus death
died truly of coronavirus,
and everybody else who died had 2.5 or more comorbidities.
Did you see that one?
I didn't see that one.
That's on the CDC website.
So it's like...
At this point, I feel like it's political.
It is for sure.
We're not allowing live entertainment in LA.
It's like, come on, bro.
Do you really see a lot of your comedian friends moving out?
Moving out of the area?
A lot of guys...
I know a lot of the big names are.
They have moved, and a lot of guys that are on my level
or lower have moved also.
And I hope they don't never come back,
because LA is over flooded.
We got like 20 million people.
We have too many.
We have like 500 people a day moving here.
From New York and from...
Probably have more, bro.
Even...
I like what you call it.
What's his name?
Ben Shapiro.
He's moving to Tennessee.
Is he really?
He's moving the whole office.
Oh, yeah.
He lives in LA, huh?
Yeah.
He's moving to Tennessee, though.
Nashville.
Have you ever met that guy?
Yeah.
I've seen Ben Shapiro.
What do you think of him?
He talks too fast for me.
I like him, but he talks so fucking fast.
Yeah, so fucking fast.
He's smart.
For somebody to talk...
And he's got that high-pitched, tinny voice.
Like, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
The thing about Trump is, you know...
Trump came and said that...
The GDP and the DNC does not like Trump.
And I just don't see how it's possible.
It's like, how do you talk?
How do you know what you're saying that fucking fast?
Like, I literally sometimes have to sit back and think
what I'm gonna say before I fucking say it.
But his brain operates like...
Dude.
So much faster than ours.
Dude.
To where he's spitting out knowledgeable facts.
Like, 300 miles per hour.
Way faster than I can ever talk and make sense.
Oh, yeah.
I gotta sit back and fucking play his shit three times over
just to figure out what he's saying.
I like Ben Shapiro.
What about...
How do you feel about Candace Owens?
She should probably be quiet.
I mean, because it's like...
With black people, as a whole,
we're very emotional.
We've seen a lot.
A lot has happened.
And a lot of people are not working.
They're not tired.
They're not exhausted.
So they have seen a lot with the police brutality,
even though it's statistically lower
during Trump's administration
than it was during Barack's administration.
It's like, as a black person,
you should know when and when not to say it.
Even if you're saying something that's 100% right,
an emotionally scarred person,
when they're dealing with something that has just happened,
they don't want to hear that.
It's like, if your brother got killed dealing drugs,
and right after the funeral someone's like,
hey, bro, if your brother wouldn't have been dealing drugs,
he wouldn't have been fucking killed.
Here's the facts.
Look how many other people's brothers got killed dealing drugs.
He's like, what the fuck?
Right.
You know what I'm saying?
We don't want to fucking hear that right now.
She's brilliant.
You know what I'm saying?
She's...
You gotta be smart to be her.
You know what I'm saying?
She'll run anybody under the table
when it comes to fucking politics.
And also, I love Angela Stanton.
You know who Angela Stanton is?
I don't know who that is.
She's a Republican that's running for Senate, I believe,
in New York.
I mean, not in New York.
In Georgia, she's one of the drug dealers
that Trump pardoned.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
She's...
When you get a chance, go look at Angela Stanton
on the Breakfast Club.
She shat all of them up.
Really?
Bro, she's...
There's some things I don't agree with her own.
I follow her Instagram page and I'm like,
all right, you...
That's a little...
Like, the whole, like, abortion shit,
I don't give a fuck about it
because I'm a nigga that needs abortions
because a lot of these girls,
I don't want them having my kids.
Right.
So it's like, leave the abortion clinic open.
Right.
I got, like, five under my belt, you know what I'm saying?
It's like, do not fuck with...
Do not fuck with abortions.
I have a lot of abortions
and I also make the best plan B smoothies
that you have ever tasted.
Really?
Yeah, in the morning, you know,
the night, the day after,
you give a girl a nice plan B smoothie
and be like, drink up.
What else you put in the smoothie besides the plan B?
Some kale, acai, Greek yogurt.
To match the taste,
I only put almond butter or peanut butter.
Really?
Peanut butter was pretty much master taste of anything.
Right, right, doesn't it look...
You're talking about those...
Plan B smoothies, dawg.
You got the recipe?
All right.
You just got to put some strong vegetables
or something strong in there,
like some turmeric.
Yeah, real bitter stuff.
Yeah, to cover the taste of...
I'm like, it's good for you.
Drink it up.
You should drink it up
because we ain't eating til two.
So drink that up.
Do they know the plan B's in there?
Of course not.
No, no, they don't know.
I'm fucking...
Yeah, they know what's in there.
I'll tell them.
This episode is gonna come back to you.
Just tell him, yeah, they know.
Yeah, they know.
Yeah, they know.
Or plan B waffle, you know.
It's gourmet.
Yeah, bro.
Blueberries and everything.
Yeah, man, but...
So what's the schedule like now out in LA
with everything shut down
and the...
I don't know if the comedy store's open or not, but...
The comedy store's open for drinks.
Okay.
So what's like your schedule?
So what do you do now
now that there's not much going on out there?
You got a podcast, right?
Mm-hmm.
So I'm on two podcasts to kill 20 podcasts,
which is the number one live recorded podcast in the world.
And I'm on Brothers Incursive,
which we're doing pretty good,
like 20, 30,000 on YouTube every week.
And like, I think 60,000 downloads on iTunes a week.
We just started actually making money from our podcast.
So shout out to that.
That's dope.
So yeah, between that
and fucking with random bitches,
that's all I pretty much do now
until, you know, comedy opens up.
I shot something for Vice like a month ago.
Really? What did you shoot for them?
I shot this campaign sponsored by Philip Morris
to kind of like turn a positive eye on vaping
so they want to get people with like influence
that are actually vaping.
I'm known like out here to be a vapor.
Like, I got my vape.
I take my vape everywhere, dawg.
Really?
Like, yeah, I'm that nigga
that gets in trouble on the airplane for vaping.
Was it?
Yeah.
Did you quit vaping to get off cigarettes?
I quit cigarettes for vaping.
You said it backwards.
Oh yeah, I said it backwards.
Yeah, that's how I meant it.
Really?
What kind of cigarettes did you smoke?
I started off, first cigarette I ever smoked
was a Newport 100 because I'm black, of course.
And then I transitioned into the Camel Crush.
Camel Crush?
The Menthol, the Marble Menthols.
And then when I ended, I was on American Spirits.
Really?
My favorite cigarettes are still Newports.
Newports.
If I ever end up smoking a cigarette,
I prefer Newport.
I have to be really fucking drunk, though.
I also did the ones that are made for cocaine sniffing.
What are they called?
Parliament.
That's for cocaine sniffing?
You don't see the little cup in the back of the filter
that's used to scoop up some cocaine?
No.
The filter starts like an eighth of an inch.
And so the paper comes out a little bit
and you can get a little...
Yeah, bro.
Oh yeah, they got a little dish in there.
I did not know that to make the cigarette lighter
because now there's more air that can get into it
with the smoke.
But like with most drug addicts,
you find unique purposes for things
that weren't intended for doing drugs.
You no longer need your fingernail.
You just get the fucking coffee.
Clearly what it was for.
They know what it was for, right?
Yeah, they know.
My boy go with it.
He's got a supreme head on.
He know what time it is.
He's got a special key just for doing cocaine.
He's got a key that's not even carved out.
It's like this big...
What is it?
It's a pistol.
Shovel?
It's not intended for me.
I got it for my birthday.
Cocaine down here probably good, bro.
I've had a lot of friends die from the cocaine over in LA.
Really?
They're putting fentanyl and everything, though.
Damn.
I'm not a real big drug person.
I do CBD and THC, like pre-roll joints,
but I don't really fuck with like...
Because I'm already like high naturally.
I've tried a few things.
It's like, oh, that ain't my cup of tea.
I've microdosed shrooms.
That was cool.
I could get into that,
but I feel like after a while,
your body's going to get used to it,
and then I'll start fucking full dosing shrooms,
and I don't want to be tripping for something.
On the regular?
Yeah, I don't want to be tripping for 8, 10 hours a day.
Every day.
Yeah, I like to be me all the time.
That's why I only drink certain liquor
that I know I can still function 100% me
while I'm on that liquor.
I can drink a whole bottle of this shit
and probably pass a drug.
Well, I can probably drink a half a bottle
and still pass a drug.
Really?
Yeah, bro.
You're about a quarter deep on that thing already.
Yeah, I'm cruising, bro.
And I'm still sitting here talking to y'all
and not sweating yet.
There's a little toast in here.
Yeah, I don't know how better the drugs are here
than they are in LA.
They're probably a lot better.
But a lot of people get into drugs a lot younger here,
I feel like, and they quit a lot earlier.
Yeah, and y'all also, just Florida,
you know it has that stigma.
Yeah, it does.
Pain pills are bad here.
Yeah, you either quit, you die, or you go to jail.
Yeah.
Like, they were never doing bath salts in LA
that I know of.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Florida does all the crazy shit.
It kind of starts here and spreads.
I don't know.
A culture or whatever starts like LA and New York drugs
has started here.
It's a testing ground.
Yeah, I don't know.
To me, people that do pain pills,
I don't know anybody that does meth.
Like me hanging with comedians,
the number one drug is shrooms, acid, and cocaine.
Really?
Okay.
But that's like...
Shrooms, acid, and cocaine.
And all that shit just is natural to me.
You know what I'm saying?
I don't see anybody have a bad trip on either one of those.
Like, I see people pop shrooms
and just go into their own little world.
DMT, people out there do a lot of synthetic DMT.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
I don't fuck with it.
No, I'd be afraid to fuck with it.
It seems like a lot.
It does seem like too much.
Yeah, bro.
Fuck that.
Mm-mm.
I'm cool on that, dawg.
Is there ever an opportunity?
I've been offered everything, dawg.
Really?
Yeah.
Every drug you can imagine, bro.
Like, I don't fuck with it.
I like how you were explaining that.
Working security at like a comedy club...
I don't work security.
...is like being a Navy SEAL.
I don't work security.
What did you do?
That's disrespectful.
What did you do?
I thought you said...
It's because I'm a big black.
Damn.
I thought you said you worked...
You started like low level working like...
I'm a door guy.
Working the door.
Okay.
I'm a door guy.
So a door...
Oh, look, whatever.
You feel your podcast and then disrespect you.
Fuck.
You work close to the front door, right?
Sometimes, but not all the times.
Like, so the door...
I mean, I'm saying you started there.
I mean, like, door hosts, we work in all the positions.
Yeah.
Right?
Just digging it up.
Dig up.
But, I mean, we work in the main room, the original room, the belly room.
We have three rooms at the comedy club.
Sometimes we work in the front patio.
And on summers, working in the front patio can be fun,
because that's where our bitch is at.
And you can...
You know, if you do it right, you can maybe sneak a couple of drinks.
Oh, shit.
If you cool with a bartender, because they don't want us drinking.
Right.
Or doing drugs.
Well, they know we do, you know, drink and do drugs, but they don't...
Don't make it obvious.
They don't want you to do it while you're on shift,
and if you do it, don't make it obvious.
So it's like, if you cool with a bartender, sneak you a drink.
So, like, working the patio on a weekend,
like, you might not make no money, like, as far as, like, tips and shit go,
because, like...
And I wonder who's going to see this.
Goddamn, I want to tell so much.
No one washes it.
You can say it.
You're a fucking liar.
I won't have a job.
It'd be bad.
But, yeah, like, you know, you can make tips in the main room,
you know, if people, you know, want to sit in a specific spot,
and they're from out of town, they'll be like,
I got 200 bucks to sit there.
Got the hook up.
Yeah.
So you want to sit right there?
Yeah.
Come on, bro.
Let me take you over there.
So, you know, you do that four or five times a night.
You just do the math, you know, if you're working in the main room,
you do it with a Joe Rogan, or if a Chris Delias up on the lineup,
you know.
How often do those big-name guys come through there?
Three, four times a week.
Really?
Every day.
Like, every day at the comic show, you're going to see somebody that you know.
Like, in any given day, a Jerry Seinfeld will pop in,
a Martin Lawrence, a Dave Chappelle.
Damn.
Just pop in.
Just pop in, though.
Hey, what's up?
Bill Burr is probably there, like, twice a week when he's in town.
Wow.
Adam Sandler's, Craig, what's the Hot Tub Time Machine?
What's his name?
Craig Robinson.
Craig Robinson.
Yeah, well, I couldn't think right now.
So, Craig Robinson.
When I saw Jerry Seinfeld, that shit was like...
What was he there just to do a little stand-up?
So, before his special drop, he came there and worked out his material.
Oh, that must have been cool.
Yeah.
So, they just pop in and do that?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
If you're a big enough name, like...
They just show up.
That's how they test their shit.
They just come in on random nights and just, like...
Well, I'm pretty sure...
...they feel the crowd out, right?
I mean, sometimes...
Sometimes they'll pop in, but most of the times they'll fucking, you know, coordinate
with our talent coordinator, and they'll be like,
I'm coming in this weekend or something.
So, like, you know, they'll fucking have a chunk,
and they'll say special guest, or they might say, like,
special guest that smokes cigarettes, let everybody know.
So, if they say, like, special guest that smokes cigarettes,
I know that's Dave Chappelle.
Okay, yeah.
Really?
But that's, like, inside information.
You won't know that coming to the club.
Okay.
You know what I'm saying?
But they'll be like,
we have a special guest that smokes cigarettes.
That's one of my favorite things about watching Dave Chappelle
is watching just what he does with the cigarette.
Like, he'll, like, pause for, like, a whole minute
and just look at his cigarette,
take a big drag off the cigarette,
and just, like, laugh himself.
Like, this just adds so much to this whole routine.
And that's the part about, like, when I was at the club last night,
versus, like, the headliner, you know what I'm saying?
Like, had I been the headliner,
that set would have went a lot different.
Because when you're the headliner
and people are coming to see you, they want to see you.
So they want to see, like, every little tick of you.
So, like, when you're, like, the greatest comedian
that ever lived, Dave Chappelle,
well, I mean, number two in my book, Patrice is number one to me.
But when you're, like, one of the greatest comedians
that I've ever lived, people want to see all that.
They want to see your mannerisms.
Right.
They want to see how you put the fucking mic in the stain.
Right.
How you walk away from it.
Every little thing.
Like, Chris Rock times every step with a joke.
You know what I'm saying? On purpose.
I don't know if you remember, it was 10 years ago,
he dropped a special, and they showed it in, like,
several different places that he was doing it
to show that he was in the same position,
telling the same joke each time in the clip.
Yeah, it was dope.
No shit.
Yeah, bro, he's, like, kind of like,
yeah, it was dope.
No shit.
Yeah, bro, he's, like, comedians are probably like some of them.
I probably had some of the dopest conversations with comics.
And that's why, like, my friends that I grew up with,
it's hard to, like, you know, when I go home,
it's hard to kick it with them, because it's like, bro,
seven nights a week, I hang with the most
interesting people in the world.
Yeah, yeah.
You know what I'm saying?
Like, bro, it's nothing for me to talk to Dave Chappelle
and we go grab food after the comedy store
and sit somewhere for three hours.
And then it's like, when I come home,
I got to fucking see your factory working ass.
So it makes shit.
What the fuck do you want?
Hey, bro, tell me some, like, profound shit.
Like, yeah, change your steel toe boots every six months.
What the fuck?
Damn, man, I had to McDonald's for lunch today.
That fucking filet of fish was good.
Bro, so, like, that's why I understand, like,
when people say, like, when people get money,
they change, you do.
Like, even me, like, I'm not rich.
I'm doing, like, okay, I'm doing, like, good for LA.
I've been there 10 years.
I must obviously be doing something, right?
You know what I'm saying?
But it's like, I'm not rich, but, like,
my taste in stuff has changed.
Like, the liquors I drink have changed.
The women I want to hang around, the stuff I want to do.
And then it's like, you know, you go back home,
your friends will be like, damn you, Hollywood, now.
It's like, nah, bro.
Like, you just don't know better stuff in life.
Right.
You know what I'm saying?
Like, dawg, I...
There's more out there.
Yeah, like, you know what I'm saying?
Like, bro, I ate Waffle House last night for nostalgia,
and then I went up to my hotel and threw up,
because my body ain't used to that shit.
I threw up last night.
Did you really?
Yeah, my body ain't used to that bullshit.
Shit, bro.
You know what I'm saying?
Bro, I shop at Whole Foods now.
Yo, Whole Foods money.
Yeah, bro, I got Whole Foods.
Bro, I shop at Air One.
I don't even know what that is.
It's a grocery store that makes Whole Foods look like,
uh, Publix.
That's where I shop.
Yeah, Whole Foods is expensive, too.
What's the fanciest grocery store we have around here?
Whole Foods.
I was in Tampa.
Probably Sprouts.
Oh, yeah.
Sprouts right on the street.
I've never been there.
Is that more expensive than Whole Foods?
They comparable.
Like, I shop at...
I shop...
So I did an experiment one time,
because every time I go, like,
not trying to brag or anything, but, like...
Not trying to brag, man.
150...
150 to 175 last me, like, a week
from Whole Foods.
So I tried to do an experiment at Sprouts,
and I spent, like, more...
$150?
Like, $150, $175.
That's, like, my...
I'm a pescetarian also,
so it's gonna be a little bit more expensive.
And I like to eat wild-caught salmon,
so, you know, that's...
I don't really want to eat the farm-raised shit
with so much mercury in it, you know?
So it's, like, you know, a little boozy, like, you know?
You're the fattest pescetarian you ever meet.
But all my fucking numbers are good.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, everything checks out.
Everything's really bad enough, bro.
L.A. people.
L.A. people, you know what I'm saying?
I do fucking cryotherapy.
Do you really?
I float, bro.
I do sensory deprivation.
Do you do the float tanks, too?
Of course.
That's just amazing, bro.
I see a chiropractor, though.
I get acupuncture.
Wow.
Like, yeah, bro.
That's amazing, man.
I do wet cupping.
Like, I do auto...
Wet cupping.
Where they, like, put, like, little incisions on you
and then put a cup to, like...
Yeah, that's what I call it.
So I'm the old bro.
Yeah, yeah, bro.
Athletes don't win shit.
I don't know, but it makes me feel good.
Yeah, mentally, it makes me feel good.
I think, is it, like, one of those things
that just makes you feel good,
because you can just drop $200 on that?
Like, that's cool.
Well, you gotta go on Groupon.
I'm not saying I'm doing, like, full price shit.
Are you not paying full?
No, I do a lot of Groupon shit.
You know what I'm saying?
I don't got that much money, you know what I'm saying?
Like, I can take a girl on a nice date,
you know what I'm saying?
Like, I could ball out here in Tampa,
but, like, I ain't, like, you know what I'm saying?
Like, this year was gonna...
If quarantine would not have happened,
the way my January, February, and March went,
I was probably gonna make, like,
probably, like, a quarter of a million this year.
Wow.
Yeah, bro.
It's good money.
Yeah, dawg.
Really good money.
The drug, the liberal.
Like, because I'm on the road every fucking weekend.
My podcast is doing good.
I'm getting booked on this, booked on that.
And then that's why I, like, lost my mind
in March and April, dawg.
Like, I was like, what the fuck?
Like, everything just fucking stopped.
Like, I was doing so good.
Like, am I not supposed to be doing this shit?
You know, like, comedians, I don't know how many comedians
I know, but we're, like, emotional beings.
Like, we have so much anxiety.
We have...
I have a panic attack every day, dawg.
Like, we have so much depression.
Like, with comedians, either we're very manic
or we're very depressed.
Like, there's no middle ground, like, regular people.
Just like any type of creative, you know what I'm saying?
There's two ends of the spectrum that either we, like,
are depressed or manic.
There's no middle.
There's no, like, oh, I just feel normal.
It's like, I either feel really happy
or I feel really fucking sad.
And that's why comedians get wound up
in so much, like, alcohol and shit.
So that's why, like, Joe Rogan does, like, you know,
where he sits in the sauna.
He does all this other extreme shit.
You have to, bro, because if you're not gonna get into drugs,
you gotta find, like, other things that you're gonna do, like,
oh, my chiropractor, that's my drug.
You know, go get my spine cracked.
You know what I'm saying?
Go fucking do cryo.
Get that feeling.
Yeah, go do my fucking cryotherapy.
I got high right now.
So what does that feel like?
Cryotherapy?
Yeah.
You play sports?
Not really anymore.
I got too many injuries.
You're like an extreme skateboarder.
Yeah, you used to.
I can tell you that.
You used to.
Yeah, he's got really brittle ankles.
Yeah.
Paper mache.
Yeah.
He's got a lot of paper mache.
Good Gusta wind will knock his feet off.
So yeah, man, it's like cryotherapy feels like an ice bath.
Yeah.
Like cold as shit, but it, you know, you ever, like,
put your hands under some real, real hot water
and, like, it feels cold for a second,
but it warms up.
That's how cryotherapy feels.
Like it's so fucking cold.
And then your body just feels like it's hot.
Yeah.
Like it's weird.
Like the body is weird, bro.
Like when it tries to, like, protect all the organs and shit,
it's like you just get like an influx of being hot.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cold shit's really good for you.
Yeah.
I take cold showers.
I don't take hot showers.
Same.
I take cold showers too.
I take hot, then I switch to cold.
No, I do.
I do it all.
You use straight cold the whole time?
Yeah.
I start off like damn near cold and then go cold to finish off.
Because I started doing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and catch wrestling
throughout quarantine to like, bro,
I'm down like fucking 38 pounds.
So I started doing that shit just to like help me because I need,
I'm a type of person like I need structure.
I can't, like, I couldn't just work a nine to five.
Like I need something to do all the time where if I don't want to do it,
I don't have to.
Not like a job.
Like you have to do a job.
But I need, so I'm like, all right, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is it.
So I'm doing this shit like three, four times a week.
And like, you get a lot of like little neck cramps and, you know,
arm cramps.
So like the cold showers and the cryotherapy is coming in handy now.
Oh, yeah, I bet.
With like the body aches and shit.
So, yeah.
I was interested, you were talking about how like talking to comedians
is so much different than talking to just like your friends who do normal shit.
But why do you think comedians are so much more interesting to talk to?
Because in order to be funny, you got to be very, very dark.
Dark?
Yeah, you got to have something to draw from.
Like whether you grew up rich or poor, like, you know, I grew up middle class
though, but I still got like hella like kid struggles that I had.
Like not having my mom around, you know, having a fucking abusive grandfather,
you know, having a racist grandfather, you know, being one of the lightest kids
out of all his grandkids.
So getting that fucked up treatment because like who my daddy was.
And like him not liking my dad.
So him taking that out on me because my mom worked out a fucking time.
So I stayed with my grandparents.
So like.
Wait, your dad was Cuban, right?
My dad is Cuban.
Yeah, he's Cuban.
But you said he's racist?
No, no, no.
You're a grandfather.
So because I grew up with like curly hair because, you know, my dad's Cuban
born out of this shit.
So like I was lighter or a little like, a little lighter than most of my cousins.
So like having a fucking like, I don't, I don't know what the dilemma was
with my great dad where he just didn't like my dad, didn't like me,
but like dog, like me and my little brother.
We didn't get treated the best.
Even though, you know, our, our mom made great money.
Not great.
I mean, great money for where we live.
You know what I'm saying?
Like we lived a great life where I went to private school part of my life
and then public school the rest of my life because of my choice.
I wanted to go to public school because I couldn't relate to those fucking
private school motherfuckers.
So yeah, like everybody has their own struggle, whether you were abused
or what, you know what I'm saying?
So that's what comedy draws from.
If, if you grew up like just too happy, like no fucking struggle,
what, what, what does your, what does your, what, what does your,
what do you draw from?
Because comedy is crazy as fuck.
I go on stage in front of people I don't know with my opinion.
And I have to make you give a fuck.
Right.
That's insanity.
Yeah, it is.
You know what I'm saying?
So think of how crazy comedians are.
We're the beekeepers of entertainment.
Like how crazy is a motherfucker that wants to go collect honey for a living?
Motherfucker, you insane.
You want to collect honey?
We're the beekeepers of entertainment.
Like you want to go on stage with your opinion and you want to make
other people care about what you think.
That's insanity.
You know what I'm saying?
Did y'all drink this tequila yet?
What are you waiting on, bro?
I'm drinking beer.
Let me look up.
There's another one.
Fuck that beer, bro.
Get the way you need to be quickly.
I'm there.
I cannot drink beer, bro.
I pee so much when I drink beer.
Yeah, bro.
Take that.
Taste that.
That's George Clooney's shit.
He sold it.
I bought this shit today.
The old guy at the register.
I trust him.
George Clooney.
That's good.
He's like, I refuse to buy this tequila.
Why?
That's why I said, I'm like, why?
He's like, because George Clooney sold his company for $3 billion.
And he's got more money than God and he needed an extra $3 billion.
Jealous.
That's what it sounds like.
Jealous.
For every guy who owns all these tequila companies in the billionaire.
He's like, he was just like George, because George Clooney, he's got too much money.
So I'll never try his tequila.
That's stupid.
Ocean's 11 was sick.
Throughout quarantine?
He are.
Come on.
In like two months in quarantine, I went through like $10,000.
I went through like all my savings.
Delicious.
Because I was buying like a bottle of this like every other day.
Is that expensive?
It can get up there like at some places, 60, 70 bucks.
You know what I'm saying?
So I was buying a bottle of that every day because it's good, right?
It is good.
It's definitely the...
I actually see that truck driving down the street all the time.
That's the best tequila I've ever had.
I have to say that.
To me, this is not the best, but for me, this is the most practical.
Yeah.
I mean, it's good.
I like Patron too, though.
I don't like Patron or Don Julio.
I don't like Don Julio.
I like it cold.
I'm not a fan of 1940.
The only...
I mean, give me a cube.
Yeah.
I'll take some ice.
Take a cube?
Ice cube?
That's what I got on my shirt.
Yay, yay, yay.
The only tequila I put above Costa Migos is Casa Azul.
And that's just like 140, 150 dollars.
What about Jose?
That's not in my range.
Jose Cuervo?
That's crackhead liquor.
Is that a glass bottle, though?
Jose Cuervo.
You know what I'm saying?
It's like to mix margaritas.
When I drank beer, I drank...
What was it?
Blue Moon?
Blue Moon.
With the orange?
Yeah.
And I used to fuck with Fat Tire when I was hanging around a lot of white boys.
Fat Tire?
Fat Tire's good.
No PBR?
Nah.
Bush?
Natty?
I mean, I grew up drinking fucking Miller Highlight because I'm a country boy.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, please.
You know, I was drinking that shit at 12, 13.
You know, I'm a country boy, though.
We drank beer in Moonshine at fucking 14, 15.
Moonshine.
Y'all drink that down here?
Nah, really, not too much.
Some people have it in their freezers.
That's...
I drank that more when I lived up north.
Up north where?
New York and Pennsylvania.
Moonshine up there?
Yeah, New York, yeah.
Whenever anyone's got it.
Guys, I was working with, like, up in the mountains, though.
North New York.
Bro, like, if New York did not get that cold, I would live there.
I like New York.
Oh, yeah.
It was cold as fuck.
New York is so real.
Yeah, bro.
I was in fucking Canada and New York this year for, like, three weeks performing.
And I didn't do anything.
Like, Uber Eats, everything.
Like, only went to the club and back to my room.
I went to Niagara Falls.
It was cold.
It was cold as fuck.
I had a...
What's it called?
Columbia jacket.
Fucking...
The hoodie that covered my ears.
Gloves.
Timbalands.
Bro, I hate cold weather, bro.
Yeah, same.
I cannot stand cold weather.
You're in the right spot.
Yeah.
Oh, this is it, man.
Bro, I got a flannel shirt on.
That's how much I like heat.
It's hot.
I got a flannel...
The biggest nigga in the room got a flannel shirt on.
Yeah, it's hot, yeah.
You know how you got warm?
I mean, I feel good, bro.
I like heat, bro.
All right.
I look like heat, though.
I'm bringing the heat.
I'm like a Tibetan monk.
You know what I'm saying, dawg?
Like a fucking Tibetan monk.
You ever been to Tibet?
No, but I will.
Are you gonna go?
Hell, yeah, bro.
I'm gonna go over there and meditate with them niggas.
Holy shit.
Yeah, I'm gonna meditate with them.
Just hold them.
I'm not even gonna feel the cold.
That's how...
That's how...
Meditation hits you.
That's how high...
Yeah, that's how high my meditation's gonna get me, though.
I'm gonna go in a cave for a year and then come out.
Yeah, bro.
Why not?
That would be sick.
I mean, because when you make a lot...
Bro, when I make, like, 25 million, I'm gonna take a year off.
Yeah.
To just...
Sit in a cave.
Enjoy myself and realize, like, who I am, like...
You know what I'm saying?
I made 25 million, dawg.
Like, I'll be good for the rest of my life.
For sure.
25 million.
Just collectively, when I do all my shit, bro.
You're gonna save that much.
You're gonna pay me 25 million when you go see my movies and come to my shows.
Or I'll probably get y'all, like, some backstage passes.
Okay.
Hell yeah.
You know, everybody collectively, you know.
Okay.
That's...
Yeah, bro, like, because I know I'll probably make a great...
A great percentage of my fortune off of live entertainment stand-up, you know.
I don't see myself being some fucking Arnold Schwarzenegger in the movie theaters.
I'll be a great character actor.
Mm-hmm.
Like, you know, like, gangster in prison or something.
Yeah.
I'm not finished getting tattoos, bro.
Like, I'm about to get a fucking necktie.
Are you really?
Yeah.
What kind of necktie are you gonna get?
I'm gonna get what was on my...
Like, it's so crazy, bro.
I'm gonna get what was on my granddaddy's casket.
It's so crazy, like, because he was, like, the only father figure I knew.
Like, my daddy was in shit growing up.
And, like, when my granddaddy died, it was, like...
I was glad he died, but I was, like, down.
That was, like, my only father figure growing up.
It was, like, a weird...
I had to really...
I was talking to my therapist a lot when my grandfather passed because when he was sick,
I was ready for him to die.
It was so weird, dawg.
Like, it's so, like, sinister that I wanted this guy to die because of, like, the shit
he did when I was young.
You know what I'm saying?
Like...
Really?
Yeah, it's like, bro, like, no matter how old you get, you know, the shit people do to
you, you remember that for the rest of your life.
Like, you probably remember who bullied you in the third or second grade.
You know what I'm saying?
You know his full name.
You never forget that no matter how nice they try to be when you're older.
It's like, bro, I still remember the fucked-up shit you did to me.
I still remember the fucked-up shit you said to me.
And I've never really gotten over that, you know?
And it's like...
And the way he treated my mom, you know what I'm saying?
Like, he...
I feel like he looked at his daughters, especially as property.
And it's like, when I got older, that shit, me and him didn't really, like, click.
Because, like, dawg, you don't have to be talking to my mom like that.
Like, I'm at the age now.
I can whoop your ass, bro.
You know what I'm saying?
Like, I'll really fight you.
So, like, when he died, it was a weird space for me.
Like, it's like...
It was kind of like...
Like, I'm glad he died, but fuck, I'm sad as shit.
Because even though he was fucked up, that's only father figure I know.
So it was a weird, weird place for me, dawg, when he died.
He died in January.
And, like, I will see him out there if it's, like, four times a week.
Because I'm like, man, I feel like a fucking asshole that I wanted him to die.
I wanted him to die.
But whatever.
I'mma get what was on his casket tied on my neck.
Made a work I...
Made a work I have done, speak for itself.
I like that.
Yeah.
That's a strong quote.
Yeah, bro.
Super strong.
I don't gotta say shit.
That's good.
I like that.
My casket, like, tied it on my neck right here.
Just the words?
Mm-hmm.
No, that high.
Like, this low.
Okay, like, right above the shirt line?
Yeah.
That's what's up.
Yeah, I like tattoos, bro.
Yeah, I can tell.
If you want me to be in your movie, just put makeup on.
Johnny Depp is tied it.
D.O. Hugley is tied it.
There's a lot of tied-it celebrities out here.
So if you want me in your shit, fucking, put makeup on it.
They're all tattooed.
I don't know anybody who doesn't have a tattoo.
Do you got one, brother?
No, I'm the only one who doesn't.
Exactly.
You over here with the gayest speech.
I don't see why anybody is in town.
Why don't you do crack?
I don't do crack.
But you should do that shit, bro.
How do you feel about, like, crack in, like, crack?
Smoking crack?
In PCP.
I want to try it before I die.
I want to try smoking crack once, at least.
I low key.
I low key.
Not PCP.
I heard PCP last a long fucking time.
Crack, I hear, just, like, lasts really quickly.
I'm not, like, I'm not drunk or anything,
but I feel like those are, like, alien drugs.
Alien drugs?
Especially, like, PCP.
You know, like, when somebody's high on PCP, they're like,
damn, he has superhuman strength.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I think, like, PCP takes the veil off
and you're actually, like, who you are
when you're high on that.
But you can't control it because you're not used to this.
It's all energy.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, it's all energy, bro.
I feel like drugs really, like, open your third eye.
And they reveal, like, who you truly are,
especially, like, PCP.
I feel like that's an alien drug, though,
because anytime you hear somebody who was high on PCP,
they fought, like, six people.
And they couldn't...
Took ten tasers and kept going.
Exactly, bro.
Naked.
Yeah, butt ass naked.
But they're naked, running down the highway.
Air Force ones.
I feel like it's an alien drug, bro.
It's an alien drug because that shit,
like, imagine if we could take that drug
but focus it to where we needed it to focus.
So that superhuman strength that you have,
you use it...
To get shit done?
To get shit done.
It was positive.
Right.
It was positive.
A positive PCP.
And not just beating up police.
That's why I feel like it's an alien drug.
Like, I mean, like, I feel like you're an idiot
if you don't believe in aliens.
You know what's fucked up, though,
about, like, alien technology?
Like, you think about the Egyptians.
They got the pyramids and all that technology
and we got PCP if this theory holds up.
Maybe they were high on...
That's a shitty deal.
Maybe they were high on PCP when they did.
They channeled it.
Joe, they knew how to do it.
Well, the aliens made the pyramids,
not the Egyptians.
Yeah, that's the alien technology they got.
Egyptians were aliens, bro.
What's up?
I technically...
I technically...
I really feel like I'm an alien, though.
Maybe you are.
Probably.
From where?
Can't not prove it.
I don't know, Broly.
Probably like, uh...
Negrodon or some shit.
Negrodon?
Some planet like Negrodon.
Oh, yeah.
Negrodon, like...
You think that would show up on 23 in me?
You took it?
Yeah, bro.
It'll show up like...
At least a few percent.
38 percent Cuban.
12 percent Negrodonian.
2 percent Negrodonian.
Like, 6 percent European.
Anglo-Saxon.
Hell, yeah, bro.
That shit will totally show up on the fucking 23 in me.
You think the aliens are coming here?
Who was coming to this bullshit?
I don't even know.
I wish we had an escape to another planet.
What do you want to come here for?
Elon Musk's trying to take you to Mars.
The only reason they would come here is to make sure we don't all just, like,
melt the earth somewhere else.
They're gonna come here to make sure we don't kill each other.
No, they're gonna come here, like he just said,
to make sure we don't come to this shit.
Like, when we start with...
They know we can't get out of it.
When Elon Musk starts launching his shit,
that's when they're gonna show themselves.
He's launching.
Like, now I'm like, are you getting too close to our shit?
Are you even gonna go fuck up our shit?
We've been watching you.
Yeah, but they said they were gonna, like,
release all the classified information
about the flying saucers they found.
Yeah, bro, this is a fucking...
It's a simulation, dawg.
They dropped us here to see how we could co-exist with each other.
Right.
And their version of Sims is playing out.
Exactly.
Like, nerds have created podcasts
and made millions of dollars playing video games.
Yup.
You know what I'm saying?
That's what we came to.
They're like, we put this shit here for you motherfucking plant trees
to fuck it.
You really fucked the whole earth up.
What the fuck are y'all doing?
You getting drunk?
Pretty soon they go press control,
I'll delete all that.
Yeah, Apple Z for a couple centuries.
Yeah, let's try it again.
Factory reset.
Yeah, we're gonna reboot this shit.
What the shit?
Apple Z for a couple centuries.
We fucking start over.
Take it back to Christmas Addicts.
Take it back to Christmas Addicts.
Take it back to the Boston Tea Party.
Let's see these niggas get it right this time.
Oh my god, dude.
But bro, think of how one instance in your life can change forever.
Yeah.
Like, dawg, three weeks before I moved to LA, I'm 19.
My best friend at the time, Cedric DeNard, calls me.
And that's why any time this girl hits me up, I send her money.
I was dating this girl named Rhonda.
She knows who she is.
I won't say her last name.
So I was posted.
My boy Cedric DeNard was a little older than me.
He had dead prison time.
That's the thing about me.
I grew up very great, but I hung with the worst of people coming up.
I hung with crackheads, prostitutes.
Because, like I said, they have personality.
I'm all about personality, dawg.
I don't give a fuck what you're doing.
I don't give a fuck what people.
Yeah.
So.
Not boring ass rich kids.
Exactly, dawg.
I hung around this guy named Cedric DeNard.
He was probably like six years older than me.
And he had went to prison as a teenager for robbing a jury store.
So when I'm like 18, 19, I'm hanging around this guy.
We doing, I feel like the statute of limitations is over.
So in making Georgia, we would go to Atlanta.
And what is it called?
Vermelie.
What is it when they take silver jewelry and then gold plate it?
I'm not sure.
It's like Vermelie or something.
Gold-plated silver jewelry.
What is it called?
Gold-plated silver.
Yeah.
Gold-plated silver jewelry.
Is there a term for it?
Yeah.
It's like vermicelli.
Is it sure?
I'm probably searching for the wrong thing.
What is it?
V-E-R-M-E-C-I-L-L-I, I think.
Vermicelli.
That's a Vietnamese noodle bowl.
And then type jewelry.
Did it come up?
Vermeel?
Yeah.
Oh, maybe.
Vermeel.
Yeah.
Some shit like that.
Huh.
Did it come up?
Silver guilt.
That's it.
That's probably.
It's the first thing that came up, so it's got to be true.
Yeah.
So basically, silver jewelry plate it with gold.
Like a thin layer of gold.
So we would go make, that's what it is, right?
So making country-ass city, we would go to Atlanta and get like...
And sell it as gold.
We would go to Atlanta and get like $500 worth of shit.
And go to making and taking the pawn shops because they only had one layer of testing.
Not like the intensive testing they had.
This was 10 years ago.
Yeah.
So we would go to Atlanta and get...
Matt Cox should be proud.
We would go to Atlanta and get like $500 worth of fucking Vermeel.
How do you say that?
Turkey 3.
Vermeel.
Vermeel.
Vermeel.
Vermeel.
That sounds right.
So we get like $500 worth of Vermeel from the Atlanta Swap Meets.
Go to Atlanta and make like three...
I mean go to making and make like 3K on it.
Wow.
So this is the type of dude I was hanging around.
You know what I'm saying?
That's a decent scam.
Yeah, it's not bad.
And it's not...
It's not harmful.
No, it's not harmful at all.
I'd be like...
I thought it was gold.
It's not like a slimy scam.
I bought it.
He's a very resell it.
Yeah, it's there.
And it's just...
Yeah, exactly.
Just a wholesaler.
It's like if you get a fake 50, just pass it on to the next one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Keep it rolling.
Just be cool.
Pay it forward.
Just be cool.
We would go get that shit from the Atlanta Swap Meets.
Come sell it and make it Swap Meets.
$500 and make us like $3,000.
We would fucking roll around town,
pull up on people doing lawn work
and snatch their weed eaters
and whatever they had in the back of their truck.
I was on some...
Even though I came from a family like that,
because I didn't really want to do what my mom wanted me to do,
she had kind of cut me off.
So I was living at her house,
but I still...
If I asked her for like $20, she'd be like,
no, so I'm like, I don't want no fucking job.
All I want to do is entertainment shit.
So I hooked up with Cedric.
And he was like, you know, if we get caught,
bro, you'll be out.
And, you know, we're just snatching little shit.
You know what I'm saying?
So I was doing shit like that.
And we snatched shit,
taken to the pun shop, steal shit.
The craziest thing I ever did was in 2008, was it?
We had like a big hurricane in Macon.
And we like went...
I was like fresh out of high school,
2008, 2009, somewhere around there.
And we went into like some like hurricane,
destroyed properties and grab stuff.
Oh, shit.
That was the worst.
I hope they don't arrest me for this one.
My lawyer's going to probably...
Allegedly.
Allegedly.
Yeah, my lawyer's going to probably contact you
in a few days.
If you release that episode...
Ceasing the system this episode.
Yeah, but he'll be all right.
But yeah, allegedly we went into people's houses
and grabbed shit.
Yeah.
I was back when...
What is it called?
You take like the copper wire from houses.
Scrapping.
Yeah, scrapping.
We still go for like four, five dollars a pound.
Oh, yeah.
Allegedly we would make like $1,200 a day
just like with scrapping shit.
You know, that's what they say we did.
I don't really know if it's true.
That's what they made.
That's what I heard.
Yeah, I heard that.
Great bond.
That's what's been...
I don't know about it that much.
But yeah, that's the type of shit that they said
he did with this other dude.
So...
You're a great politician.
I'm already in the run, is right?
So...
My blood...
I'll tell that in a minute.
So yeah.
Like three weeks before I was about to move to...
No, probably more than that
because before I was gonna move to L.A.
I was in Miami.
So probably like three or four months
before I was gonna move here,
he asked me to take him to sell a cell phone.
It was like a...
I think the sidekick, the one they should slide up.
Oh yeah, that was a good one.
He used to have that one.
Yeah, he was like,
take me to sell this cell phone
or I'll shoot you like, you know,
$10, $15 gas
and we'll get something to eat
because he was still shit.
Because back then there was no like
EINs and all that shit.
So if somebody stole your cell phone,
it was just stolen.
It was like 10 years ago.
Yeah, no SIM cards.
Yeah, if somebody stole it, it was just stolen.
Yeah, it's gone.
There's no internet where I could just
quickly type in.
I mean it was internet,
but it wasn't like how it is now.
That was different.
So yeah, he was like,
take me to, you know,
pick this shit up.
I mean to sell this cell phone
and I'm like,
all right, for sure.
I'ma come scoop you up in like 30 minutes, bro.
We'll come and do that shit.
So this chick I was fucking with
and they asked me to come through
and kick it with her.
And I'm glad that day I chose pussy.
I'm glad that day I chose hoes over bros.
He got broke.
Nah, so he went to go sell the cell phone
and I didn't know that he was going
to rob the guy of the money
but still keep the cell phone.
So I would have been the fucking
getaway driver on that fucking robbery.
Because, you know, I texted
later on that night.
I'm like, hey, bro, what's up, man?
What's good with you?
And then me and her laid up in the bed
and we see on the news at 11 o'clock,
Cedric Denard tried to rob a guy of his,
the money when selling the cell phone
and the guy took, it was an Asian guy,
the guy took the gun and ended up chasing him.
And I'm like, damn.
I was like, girl, you saved my life.
I'm like, I was like,
he did like eight years, bro.
He just got out like two years ago
because he already had,
I probably would have did, what, one?
But I was still having him down.
Maybe a couple.
I don't know.
Maybe a couple.
Maybe six months from it.
You know in Georgia how it is.
Yeah, you probably get a couple.
If you went, how does it go in Georgia?
If you're present during the admission of a crime,
you're charged just as well as the government.
You know how that Georgia shit goes.
I think it stopped anywhere.
Yeah, I don't know nothing about it.
California.
I only know Florida.
In Georgia, I believe,
even if you're the getaway driver.
Same thing in Florida, for sure.
So if somebody goes in there and shoots the guy.
Oh yeah, you're getting a couple.
It's the same in California too, I'm pretty sure.
Matt Cox was telling a story about how...
California's so liberal, dawg.
I had a friend who did a fucking bank robbery.
But he didn't use a gun.
He was out in like six months.
How do you rob a bank without a gun?
Give him a note.
He was out in six months?
Wow.
But I bet the gun ups the ante a lot.
You're doing some time with the gun.
But yeah, that's why any time that girl hit me up,
I'll get, like, bro, when I get famous,
I'll probably give her $100,000 just because.
Wow, you hear that, Rhonda?
Saved you.
You know what's up?
Rhonda knows the deal.
Shout out, Rhonda.
You guys still friends?
Yes.
Oh, that's cool.
Bro, I can never not be her friend.
Literally, you're responsible for who...
I mean, not you solely,
but you, the universe and...
Right.
Combine...
That was a serious moment for you guys.
Yeah, that was a fork in the row where you went the right one.
Even though I hate you relationship-wise,
I'm glad you had enough persuasion over me
to get me to come to your house instead of...
Yeah.
Because, you know, I was texting him like,
damn, bro, I know you're going to be mad at me, dawg,
but I'm sorry, you still my boy.
And he wasn't replying back, so I'm like,
fuck, my boy said you're mad at me, dawg.
Yep.
I just ran into him in June.
Really?
I was in Georgia, yep.
But I'm so glad that chick had persuasion over my life.
With that pussy power.
So glad.
I ain't never been more glad to have
hoes over bros until that was the only time, bro.
But yeah, man, fuck.
I could have been in prison and not be who I am now.
Because, I mean, you know, you get out of prison,
can't find a job.
Like, if I would have got out of prison,
you think I would have had L.A. on my mind?
Like, fuck, no.
No.
No, bro, like.
Oh, yeah, after a year in prison or jail, whatever.
Yeah, bro, I wouldn't have had that shit on my mind, dawg.
And ever since then, dawg, I've been like a totally,
like, I don't even do the same shit anymore.
That's that moment.
Yeah, bro.
Where it's like you can either keep going,
or you can do your thing and like realize who you are.
And it's like, how does a suburban kid
get caught up in that shit?
Like a mom who is an outstanding citizen.
Even though, like, you know, my last name, Lucas,
like, so Frank Lucas is my relative.
The drug, Frank Lucas.
Yeah.
I don't know if y'all knew that.
Yeah, of course.
He's really your relative?
Yeah, he's my real relative.
He died last year.
From American gangster.
Yeah, American gangster.
Frank Lucas is?
Denzel plays.
He died last year.
Or he plays.
He plays Frank Lucas, right?
Yeah, he was like the biggest fucking cocaine heroine
trafficker in New York.
In New York.
Yeah, New Jersey.
New Jersey.
New Jersey, New York.
Yeah.
That's a good movie.
He could dress.
Look at that guy.
That's the jacket I got him fucked up, bro.
Of course.
You can wear a jacket like that.
You're fucking chinchilla fur on something.
Yeah.
And the police are like, who is this nigga?
Look at his outfit.
I get to step out like that.
What's his relation to you?
What's his, is he like a third uncle?
So, I met him a couple of times.
I'm cool with him.
Have you really?
Yeah.
I'm still cool with some of my cousins on that side.
So, like, his somebody adopted my brother.
I, that's my dad.
I'm excuse me.
What did I just say?
His somebody adopted your brother?
His somebody adopted my daddy.
That's how my daddy got the last name Lucas.
Oh, shit.
I think it was his brother.
Okay.
Which will make him my great uncle.
Yeah.
And you met him a couple of times?
Yeah.
Where at?
Virginia.
Really?
That's cool.
Shit.
What's he like?
He was old at that point.
Older shit.
Yeah, but he's really old.
He's dead now.
Yeah.
He died last year.
But I'm still in contact with my cousin Adwin.
Shout out to my cousin Adwin up in New Jersey.
He's still in Jersey.
He's a rapper.
Got his shit going on.
But yeah, I'm still in contact with him now.
That's cool.
Yeah.
When y'all gonna come out to LA?
I was just out there.
When?
I was out there last week.
You didn't hit me up?
No.
I was there for like 24 hours.
I couldn't wait to get the fuck out of there, dude.
Why?
Because it was just like a hell hole.
Why?
Why?
This is dirty as shit.
There's fucking litter, trash all over the roads.
I don't know.
Melrose.
Yeah, Melrose is fucked up right now.
So the reason LA is fucked up right now.
It's just walking down the sidewalk.
You're just like, literally you need a shovel just to get through all the trash everywhere.
And there's like one of the, like driving down, I think, Highway 10 randomly.
Part of the fucking interstate was on fire.
There was like 10 foot flames going up over the highway with smoke and some homeless dudes
underneath it just looking at it.
Yeah, that's legit.
People were just going around it like it was nothing.
But you know why LA is fucked up right now, bro?
Because we have a lot of scammers in our city.
Scammers?
Yes, bro.
So California, again, with the liberal shit, with the EDD, there's so many people applying
that if you have a legit social, they're not really checking everything.
So scammers were coming in from all over the country and getting back pay of EDD,
like $20,000.
So they're like, I told you, didn't I tell you my identity got stolen?
Like somebody filed an unemployment claim under my social.
What?
The IRS sent me a letter saying like your social has been locked and you need to prove your
identity.
And I haven't been able to prove my identity because the question they asked, I'm like,
what the fuck?
Are you sure they're just a mistake or identity?
Because I'm sure you have a very common name, David Lucas.
My full name is David Manuel Lucas.
It's very Hispanic.
That's not a common name.
Well.
And also my social security number can't be common.
Because you need a social security number to file it.
Yeah, okay.
It's happened to me before.
And there's got to be, my name is like...
So to file an unemployment claim, you need a social.
And it's like, where are you going to say I worked at?
You know what I'm saying?
My social has been locked by the IRS because of these scammers.
So scammers are coming there and in LA or California, they were paying back pay.
So if you filed it from the time the shit happened with the $600, they're giving people
like 20K in like a month on a card.
So people are coming there and as long as you got a physical address because there's
so many people applying, you can't check every nook and cranny.
Right.
Just last week in Beverly Hills, they arrested 44 people with 125 cards totaling $2.5 million.
And they also confiscated $259 cash.
Damn, they're getting it.
They're getting after it.
Don't tell Matt.
Yeah, Matt.
Matt already on the way to New York.
He's in the chat right now.
He just left.
He's like, what?
A fucking...
A profile?
That's all I need is a profile?
What did you say about Matt last night at Waffle House?
Oh, you were asking for some girl's phone number and then say, oh, you don't need to
worry about him.
He just wants your social service.
That girl did not look 18, did she?
I at least gave her 24, 25.
Those eyelashes, those eyelashes gave her a couple years for sure.
She was at Waffle House.
So I was hoping she was over 18 just for this shit.
That bitch was raising a whorehouse, bro.
To look like that?
Yeah.
Like at 18?
Yeah.
At 18, I still look goofy and wore cartoon shirts.
Where were you guys at?
The Waffle House.
In Tampa?
Waffle House on Dale Mabry.
Oh, God.
By the strip clubs.
Oh, yeah, by the strip clubs.
We going to a strip club tonight.
Where?
Which one?
Which one?
But Tyler said he don't give me the money to throw.
Oh, Tyler.
Tyler's got the money for all.
Tyler's paying for tonight.
We're going to Baby Dolls.
Me and Tyler were talking about fake titties.
Baby Dolls.
I've been there a long time.
The worst is fake booties, bro.
Like, you ever fucked a fake booty?
Never.
That shit feels like fucking basketball.
I know a friend whose wife has a fake ass.
I think I've never seen one.
That's just disgusting, bro.
It feels like it's so much bounce when you're hitting it.
Really?
Is it like firm?
Yeah, it's like really hard.
It's like putting your dick in a volleyball.
It's so much firm.
Too much bounce.
Yeah, too much.
More bounce.
I didn't know what it felt like, but then you said put your dick between two volleyball's
and I've definitely done that.
Exactly, bro.
I get where you're coming from now.
I can relate.
I got it.
Any girls listen to this podcast.
If you're going to get a fake ass, make sure you get the fake thighs, too, because...
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Like, you can't have a giant fake ass.

Tartar sauce.

London has the worst food in the world.
Oh, I bet.

London.
Any of you niggas in London, you want to fight?
Pull up, bitch.
Y'all have the worst food in the world.
What kind of food did you eat in London?
Fish and chips, bro.
That's it.
Yes.
It is the worst.
That thick ass batter they put in.
Look at the teeth they got in London.
They got some bad bitches, though, bro.
Look at the teeth.
Any random London person, look at their teeth.
They're fucking.
Yellow, because they don't have.
Yellow as shit.
They got so much tartar on their teeth.
It's not that.
They don't even need it with their fish sticks.
They don't have fluoride in their water, that's why.
Is that really why?
Yeah.
We have fluoride in our water, so we're spoiled.
Okay.
So you brush your teeth with fluoride.
Hmm.
Is Long John Silver's big over there?
No, but Long John Silver's is better than anything I had in London.
I was saying something.
Captain D's.
Them hush puppies.
Bro, London.
I met so many bad bitches in London that don't shave.
I'm like, bitch, you're disgusting.
Yeah, that's all.
Don't shave blood, everything.
Nothing.
They don't shave their legs, nothing.
No, it's like, bitch, don't you watch the Kardashians?
You got to wax this old werewolf ass pussy.
What are you doing?
There's some girls out in St. Pete like that, too.
Yeah, there are some girls around here that don't shave either.
They got more armpit hair than all of us combined.
Don't not hop in my DMs, if you ask me.
Because I'm going to cut your ass out.
Oh, fuck.
Yeah, bro.
So my pussy that I had lined up for the night fell through.
What do you mean, you had something lined up?
Yeah, bitch, you're supposed to drive from Orlando.
Bro, there's plenty of pussy in Tampa.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I meet some tonight.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Actually, maw hoffers.
I'm sure you find something in maw hoffers.
Bro, it was a girl that was cute when we went to the day.
God damn, her name was Mia.
Mia, if you're listening.
Mia Pipos?
Yeah.
Tall with an ass.
Really?
God damn, that bitch is bad.
I think I know who you're talking about.
I could never get her to myself, though.
Because Tyler was like, that's the owner's daughter, probably.
Dark hair?
Was she dark hair, Tyler?
Dark hair, yeah.
Tall, bro.
Probably 5'11", 6'8".
Kind of fair skin.
Yeah, I know Mia.
Mm-hmm.

She's my sister's friend.
Really?
Yeah.
How old is she?
I think she's like 24.
Oh, yeah.
Tell her sister to hook that up.
Yeah, I'll hook it up for you.
Tell her sister to hook it up with a nigga that's on their way.
Well, get me a public maw hoffers.

I gotta text my sister.
You know what I'm saying?
Text your sister right now.
All right.
Be like, hey, you still friends with that girl, Mia?
Ask her to show her.
Tell her my picture.
She won't remember me.
And even texting.
He's just tapping his phone.
No, I'm texting her.
I'm going to text a picture of you to my sister right now and say forward it to Mia.
And the crazy part is, bro, I can tell what kind of chicks she, she don't know.
She's one of those words.
Like, how did you, when you started talking to her, you're just like, what's your name?
What did you say?
I couldn't ever talk to her because she, I don't feel like she knows she's cute because
she keeps her head down too much.
She's very, very like, what do you call those like introvert?
She don't know she.
Did she work there?
Yeah.
Oh, no, no, no.
Not the same girl.
Lying ass nigga.
Not the same girl.
She worked there.
No, no, no.
How did you miss that part?
He been lying for the beginning.
Yeah, damn.
Did she work there?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
You thought I was talking about a bitch that was eating there like some random bitch.
Some random Mia.
Yeah.
A high on Dave.
That's right, John.
Two cubs is motherfucking tequila.
Wait a minute.
She works there?
Nah, nigga, some random bitch named Mia.
Just a, just a one off Mia.
I don't know.
How many Mia's could live around here?
Not many.
This is like a small town.
I don't think there's any Mia's.
You underestimate the Mia's.
What the fuck is Mia's?
That might even be her real name.
Yeah, it's short for something.
Yeah, it's short for something.
Yeah, it's short for something.
Yeah, it's short for something.
Yeah, it's short for something.
Yeah, it's short for something.
Yeah, it's short for something.
That's, I'm shooting the her real name.
Mama Mia.
Mama Mia.
Mama Mia.
Yeah, my friends be like, nigga, you vapor iPhone.
You're real.
You can control the temperature with that.
Can you really?
So if you want to blow some chunky clouds, you can just crank it up.
Look at that action.
Look at those circles.
Look at that shit.
Those O-rings.
Damn.
No wonder Phillip Morris wanted you.
They just don't quit.
There they are.
That was good.
No wonder Phillip Morris wanted you.
You said how much this cost?
This full amount is probably like $100.
$100?
Damn, that's a lick for a fucking vapor.
But this is also a geek vape.
This vape is known to be indestructible.
Really?
Yeah, because I've dropped this thing probably.
I drop it daily.
How long have you had it?
Maybe like two years now.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
So I've had geek vapes for two years, but I had this one since January.
Because when I was flying in my great 80s funeral, I had my oldest daughter with me.
And like, you know, I don't know if you're, well, you don't have kids.
I got a kid.
Oh, you do?
Yeah.
How old?
One-year-old.
Okay, so you don't know about the five-year-olds yet?
No.
So when you're dealing with a five-year-old, you're dealing with it like a mini-personality.
So like, I left my vape in the pocket of the airplane.
Because she's asking so many questions.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I haven't experienced that tear.
Wait till she get three, bro.
One is easy.
Yeah.
They just walk around and make noise.
Yeah, that's basically it.
I want to eat everything.
I want to eat everything, yeah.
I don't see you as a type of dude who like leaves his dick in when you're fucking.
Does he look like that type?
He does not look like that type of dude.
He looks like he put the hole in the underwear and leaves his socks on.
I don't typically, I didn't want to leave my dick in.
Something suspicious.
That wasn't my thing.
That was more like my wife's thing.
She made sure I did.
You look like a type of girl.
You look like a type of guy who's called a girl disgusting.
You know what I'm saying?
You're such a fucking nasty whore.
That's a type of guy.
You do not look like the type of nigga that nets and bitches.
I'm not calling your wife a bitch.
But you don't look like the type that keep your dick in.
No, she was the first one I ever shot my load in.
He been missing out.
What?
She was the first one ever.
First in the last, bro.
She was tripping.
Bro, what?
It's a true story.
True story.
I'm not going to be able to move you to LA, bro.
Total.
Because nigga, I will corrupt you.
Your wife ain't letting you come.
She's like, you would never be on this nigga's podcast.
He could come.
I think he could come.
I'm coming.
No, bro.
I was always afraid.
I got a two pack.
Don't worry, bro.
I'm sponsored by a boxer company.
Don't worry.
I got you in there.
What boxer company?
Sheath.
Sheath.
They got a whole, they shot out of my nigga's sheath.
They got actually a pocket.
Sheath or sheath.
Sheath.
Like a sheath for your sword.
S-E-S-H-E-A-T-H.
Boxers.
That's a great.
They actually got a pocket in the front of the boxes for you
to put your balls in there.
Really?
I wouldn't show y'all, but I don't want to make y'all jealous.
A pocket for your balls and dick.
You have to send us some.
I don't know if I'd like that.
So you put your dick in the hole.
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Turn your screen.
I got them all right now, bro.
That's all I wear.
Designer waistband.
What the fuck?
I got them all right now, bro.
That's my sponsor.
That looks like a Versace waistband.
It looks like how sandals separate your toes.
Like that, but another.
Bro, my balls break your nuts.
My balls never get sweaty anymore.
Wow.
I didn't know that existed.
Look at this guy in the web banner.
This might be awesome for work.
You can do that.
I wear them when I practice Brazilian jiu-jitsu, bro.
Yeah.
My balls, like, you know, you go home.
I'm about to order some of those.
Is there a picture of you on here wearing them?
How come they ain't got you flexing in the Instagram community?
I ain't fucking doing that.
Bro, you got to do Instagram.
Use the promo code TONYCHAN to get 15% off the sheet.
Tony Chan?
Yeah, Tony Chan.
But only use it if you recommend that he gets in them
and take some pictures.
I'll show my dick off.
I ain't got no shame in my game.
Does it fold it up or does it go down?
My dick go down, bro.
I got weight to my shit.
It hangs.
Yo, dick go up, dickers.
It goes in my body.
I don't actually need to wear it.
It's like a turtle.
I'm gonna forget any turtle.
I got a belly button in it.
Now I understand why you never mind.
Roast him for like...
You can do it.
Can you roast him?
Yeah.
He's got a big nose.
And big teeth.
And he's got one blue tooth.
Blue tooth?
You got a fake tooth?
Really fake tooth.
Me too, my nigga.
Right here.
Do you really?
You can't even tell, though.
1500.
1500.
How much was yours?
Oh, my mom paid for it.
I forgot a group hug, too.
She found it.
You had to get a root canal with that, too.
It's actually...
It's a seashell.
It's a chick.
It's a chicklet.
That nigga says we got a blue tooth.
Super Role Sunday.
Super Role Sunday?
That's what I broke my tooth, though.
Last year, Super Role Sunday.
Oh, shit.
I swear to God, bro.
That's what I broke my tooth.
That's biting into a chicken wing on Super Role Sunday.
Holy shit.
I went face first into a bench skateboarding.
My shit was last year, Super Role Sunday.
Okay.
I was at a Super Role party with no fucking tooth, bro.
You just ride out the rest of the party?
I was like, fuck it.
I'm not going.
How am I going to get a chicken wing?
How am I going to get a dentist now?
Yeah.
All this chicken?
I tried to, bro, but that shit was like six grand.
For a dentist to come from this house to do it right then.
But then, still, he would have just only removed the root and shit.
Because it was a permanent tooth.
So I got the root removed, and I got a...
So what'd you do when it happened?
I got a semi-permanent, and I'm going to get my permanent next year.
Because to fix my whole mouth, I got like three teeth.
I need implants on.
It's like 15K.
Teeth are not cheap.
God damn.
Yeah, bro.
I might go to Mexico for my shit.
What were you saying?
Like, when it happened, what did you do?
You just rode the rest of the party out?
You just drank some Casamigos and...
I literally bit into a shit, and I was like, damn, I chipped my tooth.
It didn't hurt?
No, it didn't hurt.
I bit into it, and I was like, damn, I chipped my tooth.
And then...
Well, let me explain.
So I had a root canal from when I was a kid, or when I was a teenager.
So it had like a root canal, and it had a...
What do you call it?
Cap on it?
So it was already like dead on the inside, like most of these bitches out here.
So I just bit into the fucking shit, and it came out.
And I didn't even know it.
I was picturing it like painful, and you just drank some tequila.
I got a high-pain time.
Bro, you sure got fucking hand tattoos, y'all.
Who's that on the other hand?
A black Medusa.
Fuck, yeah.
You know the story about Medusa?
Oh, yeah.
What happened?
She got the snake in her hair.
That's all I know.
Why?
I don't even know.
She didn't even know shit.
I didn't read the story.
I don't read.
Medusa got raped.
Can't even read.
Medusa got raped by men, and her mom gave her a head of snake hair.
She got raped by men?
How many?
A lot.
White men.
Fuck.
Like you.
Just like me?
Was Medusa black?
Was she?
No, but I'm making a black Medusa, bro.
Okay.
Because you can get white from black, but you can't get black from white.
You feel me?
Boom.
And she's on black skin, so she has to be black Medusa.
So, yeah, she was raped, and her mom cursed her with a head of snake hair, so the men
looked at her.
They turned it to stone to protect her from ever being raped again.
I did not know that.
That's a short story.
That's a crazy story.
That's fucked.
Greek myth.
Greek mythology, man.
Greek mythology.
I don't read enough.
Do you know any other myths?
Nah.
Do you know about Sisyphus?
Sisyphus, tell me.
So, Sisyphus was cursed to push a boulder up a hill, and then once he got it up the hill,
it just rolled down, and then he had to go back down and push it up continuously.
And then there's this philosopher that was out in the 50s and 60s that wrote this story
about how he compared it to the way that people work and people grind, and you find joy in
whatever you're doing, the longer you do it and the more effort and you that you put
into it, you start to identify as that, and even though it's like a meaningless task over
and over again, you can find moments of joy in it.
And rolling a boulder up a hill?
That's kind of like how life is, period.
You'll get up to a peak, and then you'll be like, fuck, everything's tumbling down,
and then you're like, let me start again if you're doing a passion project, you know
what I'm saying?
Like, you film.
Yeah, and it's that moment too, like, right as you get it to the top, that moment right
before it rolls down, but you know it's about to roll down.
That's how my dish was, dog, I'm not even lying to you, like, nigga, I was projected
to like, yeah, and it's like, I'm not giving up, like, fuck it.
I'll start from where I got to start from when all the shit open back up, I don't give
a damn.
Like, you can't hide a shark in a pond, like, soon he's gonna surface, you know what I'm
saying?
I'm still a fucking white tiger.
A white tiger shark?
A white tiger, period.
Like Tiger King?
White Tiger Shark.
Did you watch Tiger King?
Yeah, that's my nigga, Free Joe.
Free Joe.
I put money on his books, nigga, no lie.
That's it.
I put money on Joe's books.
Shout out to Joe.
Yeah, did you really?
Hell yeah.
On that green dot card, nigga, hell yeah.
Did you make a note of that, that he did that?
Hey, can I shout out something about shit, too?
Hell yeah, shout out to all of you.

Hell yeah.
You guys as much Patreon money as Tim Dillon?
Nah, not yet.
So our page, like, so you know how it is.
You see how many people you got in here?
So Madri had, like, our sponsors bringing decent money.
Our sponsors?
Yeah.
Like, sheath boxers.
Like, we get good money from them, but it's like, we have to split it so many ways because
so many people are involved in the podcast, so it's like, six people.
How many people do you have on the podcast that are involved in your podcast?
Three that you see and then, like, three that you don't see.
Isn't the guy that you work with the same guy who started Joe Rogan's podcast?
Yep.
Yep.
So it's like, you see as many people on screen as you don't, because there's a lot editing.
I don't do none of that shit, bro.
Posting.
Yeah.
You know, editing our clips, like, yeah.
So it's like, there's six hands in the pot, so you're like, you know, if we're making
five grand a month, that splits six ways.
So it's like, you know, plus the assistant, that's $800 a month.
Yeah.
It's like, if I just had, you know, two people, we can make a nice living off of that, you
know?
Yeah.
So it's like, you know, everything in entertainment, you're like, because most of the time, talent
doesn't know how to do anything except for be talent, and that's where I'm trying to
get better at.
Like when I saw him doing the shit, I'm like, hey, how you do that, bro?
I want to learn that shit.
Yeah.
So I don't have to pay this person to keep doing that shit.
I can learn how to do it myself.
Right.
But it's like, pretty soon you'll get too busy to where you can't do it.
And you're like, whatever.
Right.
Give him $1200 a month.
How come that guy, Brian, started, stopped working on Joe Rubin's podcast?
I don't even honestly know, bro.
He still, he's always got the new guy.
That's why Jamie, he still does something on, on Joe's podcast.
He still makes appearances on it.
Yeah.
But he used to be like the behind the scenes guy.
Yeah.
I don't really know what's, I don't, I don't really know the intimate details.
Yeah.
Why he's not like hands on as much as he was when they first started.
But I mean, he's pretty, he's pretty invested in our podcast.
Yeah.
That's just funny.
