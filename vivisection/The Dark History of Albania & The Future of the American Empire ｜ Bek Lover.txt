why is it that every Albanian I've ever met looks like they would kill you for sport
you know it is man we uh we're we're we're people that have been in perpetual conflict man
you know the Albanian territories are sit on the crossroads of the empires
so if you look at where we're positioned because you know I know Americans are amazing with geography
you know we're at the crossroads man we're north of Greece we're south of Serbia
we're really technically in the heart of the world but we're in the heart of the empires right
that's where the roman empire had provinces that's where um you know the Ottoman empire
spent a good five six hundred years world war one started there right in Bosnia so
when you look at the region that we come from unfortunately it's been a very hostile place
for a very long time and unfortunately it looks like it's going to continue to be that so the
Albanian people um the world calls us Albanian and it's very similar to how we have the word jew
the largest tribe if i'm not mistaken of israelites was the judeans so that's what people call them
way they had more contact with that tribe that's where the word jew comes from right the largest
tribe of the ancient illyrians was the albanoi tribe because the albanians are also a tribal
people so the world had more contact with with that so we got the word albanian from that we
don't call ourselves albanian the word that we use in our own language is called ship tar ship tar
ship tar so like ship tar and when another albanian sees another albanian okay what's up sheep
so listen it's a it's unfortunately still one of the poorest regions in the world it's the poorest
region in all of europe we've been through conflict after conflict we've been struggling for our
freedom for over 2000 years and i would equate us to like being kind of like the afghanis of europe
but people that have constantly under conflict constantly struggling to to live in peace but
we're not as you know you know not not as similar history as the afghanis but what i'm saying is we
come from a very rugged terrain it's very mountainous it's the second most mountainous country in all
of europe after switzerland you didn't really have roads up until the last 10 years so a lot of times
you know we're mountainous regions very poor always in a constant constant state of war
that's going to aid you danie and it's going to make you rugged it's going to make you tough
because you have to be tough just to survive you know those stories of i used to walk 20 miles to
get to school like my dad really walked 20 miles to get to school like he was not lying to me
you know i'm born and raised in america i'm first-generation i'm very blessed to be
here man and and and how lucky i am and i and i know a lot of albanians feel that way because
every time i go back to albania in the albanian territories the number one question i'm asked is
how do i get to america man i want to get to america and everybody wants to come here
nowhere else yeah here yeah i was telling you right before we started i back in the day when
i was like in my early my mid teens i worked construction and i worked with these two albanian
and i'd never heard anybody talk so positively about america before they were just so happy to be
here they were some of the most like fun kind people i'd ever met and i still keep in touch i
still talk to them they still this one guy uh his name is ilia ilia ilirian ilirian ilirian
yes ilirian and so our language is the oldest original inter european language in existence
when you look at the family tree of languages you have latin-based languages like portuguese
spanish italian they're all cousins then you have the slavic languages like russian polish
right um you know serbian these are slavic languages yeah the albanian language comes from
nothing it's original when you look at it so you know a lot of the countries that surround us
unfortunately are very hostile towards us and i really hope that our neighbors can just let's
accept the status quo man like nobody's one in these conflicts you know speaking about your
friends in the albanian culture it's extremely important the guest the guest they have an expression
in albanian the guest is the god of the house hmm you know basically when someone comes over your
home you're responsible for their life the second they cross your threshold you're supposed to treat
them better than you treat yourself you're supposed to feed them better than you feed yourself
they're sleeping in your bed you're sleeping on the floor you take your shoes off before
you enter the house the house is a sacred place the home so when a guest comes over
you know they you know ask anyone that's ever visited an albanian family you know everything's
coming out every food every beverage every out whatever we have whatever you want we don't have
what you want there's something to get out to the store the guest comes first because it's very
important you know but listen the longer you live in the melting pot we start to kind of adopt
right the american way of life or it might be a little bit different say hey you want to sleep
over my house you're sleeping on the couch right but we are a very loyal people you know what bothers
me and you know i'm from my mom's family's from tropoya where if you watch the movie taken right
that's where the guys come from and they get this bad reputation you know of being these guys that
you know we don't want we want to avoid certain words for the sake of the podcast but you know
that movie everyone knows what it's about it's about a guy whose door gets taken and blah blah
blah and sold into the to the black market and this is like the most watched movie that has anything
to do with our people and for me it's like heartbreaking because it's like we've already had
so much of a tragic history we've done so much for the world that the world doesn't even know about
and this is how we're portrayed you know in films when most albanians live you know half of our
people live abroad because of the perpetual conflicts because of the hostility of our neighbors
because of the poverty that our people live in most you know half of our people live outside
they live in germany switzerland austria they live all over the world australia but there's a big
chunk of us in america the love for america as you mentioned earlier goes back to the early 1900s
most americans don't realize that you have no greater ally not just in europe
in the world when it comes to the relationship of the american and the albanian what the american
east understand is that the albanian people are willing to fight and die for the united states
of america you want proof then the proof is when the adam and empire collapsed adam and turkey
they controlled most of that region for 500 years when they collapsed there was no borders and
boundaries you're under an empire it's just one big blanket there was no borders and boundaries
the balkan wars erupted and everyone that was stronger was just grabbing land the greeks took
what they could the serbs took what they could and we were in the middle of all these different
countries and we lost about 70 percent of our territory we would have lost a hundred percent
of our territory if it wasn't for woodrow wilson the president of the time the first albanians to
america settled in boston so i always make a funny joke most americans don't know a cute little fact
two countries started in massachusetts the united states of america when the first pilgrims landed
on plymouth rock and albania albania was recognized as a sovereign nation because of woodrow wilson
and the first albanians that migrated to boston wow they were able to court the friendship of
woodrow wilson who was the president at the time one of them went to harvard we're talking about
faikonica is a very influential person we owe our existence to him and a couple other figures in
boston they're buried there in the forest cemetery in boston if it was not for them and their
friendship with woodrow wilson when we were being attacked by all of our neighbors we would have lost
100 percent of our territory and we would have been the Kurds of europe he went to the league
of nations woodrow wilson which at the time was today's modern version of the united nations
and he lobbied and said listen you got to give these people something so the love affair of our
country with america is over 100 years old we literally owe our existence to the united states
of america now we're much older than that right but we're talking about in modern history where we
had a chance to literally be wiped out the love affair continued in the late 90s when the war broke
out in kosovo and the clinton administration got involved and initiated bombing against
syria which ended that conflict and made them withdraw and today albania is i mean kosovo
is recognized as an independent country even though most albanians consider it just albania but we
can't control what the world's doing with us yeah we build statues of american presidents
so if you go to albania or kosovo you're gonna see statues of george bush statues of bill clinton
statues of hillary clinton the highway that connects kosovo and albania is named bue biden
bo biden highway they named it after his son they don't know about us as americans they don't know
about our political strife right now how we're you know at each other's throats left and right
they don't care about any of that they don't know what we're going through in america and they don't
care about our politics they just want to respect the country they want to respect us as americans
as a matter of fact after that conflict ended they were naming their kids if they had a boy clinton
or bill or billy and they were naming their daughters hillary to respect america it wasn't
about they don't listen they're not into our political strife over here right so when i say
that america is making a big mistake yes albania joined noto nato albania is a nato but kosovo
is at a force of 5000 that's all they're letting us have we can't defend ourselves and you know
it's like a slap in the face when you know someone that was in the world you know underneath the
buildings in york when they you know they went down that day in september you know we went over
there to take out this enemy that we ended up leaving in power anyway 20 years later leaving
them all these weapons that if they would have gave us we would have been a formidable force
who's willing to fight and die for the united states of america if the american government
said albanians do you guys want to be a part of the us are you willing to be the 51st state
we would be the 51st state no hesitation i'm i'm so confident in our love with this country
that i know our nation if they rather than being the european union if they gave us a choice to be
the 51st state we would be that's how much love we have so i hope whoever watches this understands
we need to be armed we need to be trained not because we've never been the aggressor in history
we've never attacked our neighbors but if we're a force to be reckoned with then maybe we will
bring peace and stability to the Balkans maybe our neighbors won't keep attacking us and we can have
peace for once permanently in the Balkans how does that make you feel like having your unique
perspective on the united states and living here and seeing all the strife going on here and all
the division going on here what is that like it's terrifying you know being born in the us
and growing up here and being proud and even when i would go back to visit so even before
the kosovo war erupted when i used to go visit my dad's family in kosovo i went there as a
child for us as a baby but the first memories i have of it are in 91 right when the bosnian war
erupted and kosovo was still a part of yugoslavia it was a province that had autonomy so we always
had a special class you know we were given a certain degree of self-rule under yugoslavia which
at one point was a functioning country people got along people had jobs like they had like they
didn't need visas to go to certain countries like they had a decent life there for a while this guy
kind of had it together i'm never a fan of socialism or communism but this guy seemed to
like give everyone like a break let everyone live you know people say like life wasn't too bad
under that that guy tito he was the you know the main figure of yugoslavia for a very long time
when nationalists got into power in these other different countries those wars erupted so my first
memory was getting off the plane seeing soldiers with guns everywhere checkpoints everywhere i'm
leaving this beautiful life and and when i was younger we were really poor so it wasn't like
i was leaving this extravagant home i was leaving an apartment but compared to where i was brought
up and and as bad as we might have been financially when i was younger going over there i was like wow
man am i lucky and i'm living in a in a two bedroom apartment you know with my family
to see you know no power most of the day no running water most of the day police everywhere
soldiers everywhere so during that time kosovo lost its autonomy when molosevic came into power
there was a brutal regime they laid off all the albanes they fired them from their jobs
and and i'll say this to everyone that watches us you know my goal here is not to
paint negative pictures of other communities i think there needs to come a point where we
gotta forgive each other and move on but never forget what happened i lost a lot of family in that
war nobody wins in war they didn't win in war our countries are all poor we're all struggling we're all
suffering so coming from the u.s with that perspective and seeing the opportunities that i had
i did phenomenal in school brother straight a student academic scholarship because i had a chance
my my cousins can even go to school they were in private homes albanian children were not
allowed to go to school in kosovo this is a fact we never asked to succeed from yugoslavia
we only wanted autonomy and if you look at all the archives of the news the first demonstrations
the first protests were never for the albanian population to break off of yugoslavia it was
simply to restore their autonomy that was given to them by tito we didn't ask to break off we didn't
ask for an independent country but when the brutal crackdown came we declared our independence but
we did not bear arms hmm we chose to follow the teachings and the philosophies of dr martin
luther king and mahatma gandhi we tried the civil disobedience peaceful protests very similar to
what happened in the civil rights movement here in the u.s if you look at the images of kosovo
in 97 98 people were being beaten with dogs hoses on us they'd come to your house round you up take
you to jail torture beat you for the same rights that many americans are giving up today when you
ask me about what do you see i'm very worried when i start to see suppression we can't have open
dialogue about things that are impacting our life we're avoiding certain words here and you know why
we had this discussion before we started but everything that's happened in the last three years
folks that's affected our lives and we can't sit down and talk about certain doctors or certain
politicians and if we do things get taken down is this america anymore because when you start to
have that type of uh suppression it reminds me of seeing the type of propaganda that was being
pushed out there during those conflicts where my family comes from the fact that you can turn
on the mainstream news and never see a world leader speaking unfiltered no i don't want your
opinion let me see what putin's got to say yeah let me see what's the length he's got let me see
the whole one hour if i want to and most people don't even know where to even pull up their speech
and look at it or read it you'd have to like actually go in and search and find it the fact
that we can't see the president of the red nation right the red flag with the yellow stars that makes
everything we own right that once the last time you've seen their president talk for more than five
seconds on the news so how are you gonna formulate an educated honest opinion about current events
what's going on in our nation let alone in other people's countries that impact our life brother
if we go to war what do these wars benefit our country 20 years of conflict the middle east went
on fire those people that we went to take out and overseas after that horrible day that happened in
new york city right well two two buildings came down those people are still in power so what did
the american gain so to see this type of stuff going on to me our deficit where it is the amount
of money we're printing is terrifying and to hear the level of ignorance i hear from people saying
hey you know what man we're america you know like we'll never fall even albanians that america will
never fall i go brother every empire can fall every country can fall and you as an albanian
should know how many empires have we seen collapse when they ruled us they were the most powerful
empires in the world and where are they today we visit their runes and the artifacts that they
left behind and the same thing can happen to us and you know what i believe if we don't change course
soon we will be no longer exist in the way we've known it throughout our lives because we're close
and age me in you yeah how long uh when you were so you were born in in new york or texas i was born
in texas texas shock shock to those of you after but i grew up in the new york city area my entire
life and how old were you when you decided to go back to albania and whatever made you decide to go
back i didn't decide to go back well just family there and i didn't go to albania in the beginning
because albania communism had just collapsed and it was literally like the wild wild west at that
point now it's an amazing place to visit it's growing exponentially with tourism but 91 was
the first time i remember going my dad took me in the 80s as a child i've seen videos of me there
but i don't of course i don't remember so 91 you know i get off the airplane and then they had a rule
at that time if you were outside of yugoslavia or syria at that time you had 24 hours to report
to your local police station and register why you were in the country and they'd ask you all kinds
of crazy questions and at that time there wasn't a lot of albanian americans going back to visit
so i remember always being nervous scared there was checkpoints everywhere they would stop us
sometimes they would come into my family's homes in the middle of the night and it's just like people
don't realize what it means when you have that type of tyranny or overreach that you know to live
in that type of a world where they can just come into your house for no reason interrogate you for
no reason arrest you for no reason you have no trial like you know these are things we take
for granted as americans you should never be giving up you're inalienable rights you're
constitutional rights you know a lot of these things are in play right now whether americans
realize it or not so to see this type of stuff happening in our society where i haven't really
seen anything this volatile and you know since i've been alive is very scary man and it's very
alarming to me and i really hope people are paying attention i feel like when you're a fifth sixth
seventh eighth generation american you know you were born with this privilege that you don't even
realize you have a lot of people don't travel man i tell me go look outside man no one's saying
we're perfect and no one's saying no one's ignoring our past as americans i'm speaking as an american
first yes we have a dark past no one's denying it but please go visit other countries right now and
see how they treat you being a different race a different nationality i've experienced racism
because in certain parts of europe they can tell my name's albanian they wouldn't let me into night
clubs man just because they knew i was albanian so i know that i'm comfort i also know what it
feels like to be hated to the point where you lose 30 people in your family right i lost 30 people
in a single day during the course of a war the only person to survive the massacre of that village
in my family is my first cousin you shot over 30 times on top of a mountain no medical aid no help
they're hunting him down it's kind of like behind enemy lines the movie he's wounded they can't
you know they're hunting him down they can't find him he has no help no food my friend you get shot
once and you don't get help in a day or two you're probably dead right that's why i believe unless it's
your time and i've seen too many instances of this in life unless it's your time nothing on this earth
can kill you he was shot 30 times and his lower extremities three to four days his documentary
is online i can get your footage of it you can show him explaining what happened to him you know
first he witnessed the death of all his first cousins and then he's coming down this mountain
with his foot tied around his neck with a belt crawling like this with his arms on his butt
down a mountain he fell down hundreds of yards however i got the message he was dead so when i
get the phone call i found out these 30 guys says i used to go back every summer he said you know
when you used to visit these guys made it bearable for me because they were similar to me in age we
play hide and go seek they treated me like your friend treated you that you talked about very
hospitable he's come from america we have to honor him we have to like take care of him
what's crazy is that i used to feel really sad bro because being so privileged at that time the
albanians were not using the currency of Yugoslavia because of the crackdown and the brutal oppression
we created parallel systems trying to supersede the oppression that was going on so we had our
own school systems within private homes so imagine there's a beautiful high school but
there's no albanians in it they're not allowed to go to school we had an apartheid and meanwhile
we're 90 of the population in that province right and we had no rights so i would see what
they went through they started using the german mark this is before the euro so they were using
the deutsch mark as a secondary currency and also because inflation was so high with the
currency of Yugoslavia that they used it was easier just to do business with the german mark
so at that time when i would visit one dollar was like two to three marks depending on the year
that i went it was between two and three times our money so one dollar was getting me three of their
dollars my dad would give me a thousand bucks for two months and i couldn't spend the money man
and i just felt bad because like here i am this little kid 12 years old and i'm buying everyone
food and drinks and i'm not even thinking about it i'm telling people in the village yo whatever
you need man grab bags of flour whatever you need rice
i'd still go home with money at the end of the two months man and i'm like sitting here feeling
bad that i'm buying 40 year olds and 50 year olds food so when you say to me how did that impact your
life i was like god gave me this chance to be born in this beautiful country to have a chance to do
anything i want learn anything i want and i'm gonna point fingers and blame people when i see my
family i see my friends i see my people they have no chance they have no freedom they have no rights
no man i love this place i'll i'll die for this country man and for me to see where we are is
lack of information suppression of information ignorance at the utmost degree in ignorant
squared is what's going on right now and it's sad what's going on in our country right now do you
have kids i got three what sort of lessons do you teach your own kids about the world about
life about the way they treat other people that you've gained from your experiences being over
there and coming back to here so i've been able to maintain the next generation in this nation
even though i believe the majority of our people will see what's sad is because of everything that's
happened to our people and 50 percent of us live abroad we run the real risk of losing half of our
population not to war or conflict but to poverty so when we all live abroad and two generations
brother we're not gonna know how to speak albanian anymore most albanians and 100 years from now won't
even know where albania is right because they become right right right where they are i'm still
first generation so i'm in between the two worlds my children they will be because their mother's
actually from there she's from kosovo she survived the war thanks to america every day she says if
wasn't for america i'd be dead her family almost got wiped out there was a village that was wiped
out next to them in the peya region the serbs pronounce it pech but in albanian it's pronounced
peya and in that region they got trapped in the city and they were fortunate to run into
you know people that were doing bad things but they weren't wiping people out and then
when the nato plane started flying over they evacuated but if they would have fell into one
more group's hands my wife wouldn't be here today so that pressure from nato literally saved my wife's
life she's writing a book about it well not without my father she literally saved her father's life
she her family was hiding outside of their village her dad got trapped because he went
back to the house to get something they're all hiding and you couldn't you couldn't trust them
you didn't know they were wiping people out left and right you know these are people that
massacred the basians right so they told her listen bring your whole village back
well we're gonna kill you that but how do you trust them so she goes back and tells them all
if you guys don't come out of hiding right now and go back to the village i'm telling them
where you're hiding so she literally is like a 12 year old girl took the most dangerous risk ever
forced her family to go back to their village they were at gunpoint for like three days they beat
them up a little bit nothing too crazy then the nato planes started going they left they
evacuated and they survived the war and he's her dad's alive today because of her so that's my
children's mother right so you're not gonna forget what you've been through and the opportunities
that you have i always say i wish i had because even though yeah i come from over there i was
born here man i was brought up very very blessed right compared to i wish i had the hunger of so
many people i see come here what they do in such a short amount of time boggles my mind
i'd rather have been the albanian that came here as an immigrant than the one born here the one
that came from over there brother within 10 years they all buy homes successful businesses
they work hard and that's also i feel like when you don't have a choice i feel like we're so spoiled
i have a million different things i can do i'll go to school maybe i'll major in language arts and
i'll switch to a minor in marketing you know like we have all these options where when you come here
as an immigrant you don't have an option you have to survive you have to succeed so that's why a lot
of them end up in construction right or they own restaurants they work hard in a restaurant they
save their money they buy a restaurant my father started with pizzerias and then he got into real
estate which he did extremely well my father was an animal he worked like 14 hours a day i didn't
see him for years until he amassed what he did and you know no matter what the dude's my hero
to come here to not speak the language not have any money not have any back no support
and people want to talk about the american dream i am the american dream i was given the chance
to do things that my father never could do and so many of us man it's like yo if you're american
you're born here come on like you got so much opportunity that you just don't see it but you
like some of the stuff that you saw and some of the stuff that some of the other kids who were born
there and immigrated here some of the stuff that they saw it's almost impossible to convey that to
children that are growing up in the united states it's almost it's gotta be impossible right like
the only way film film does a little bit right you can learn tiny bit you can learn stuff in school
but the experience the first hand experience trauma brother that trauma that knowledge that you that
first hand knowledge that you have burned into you that's something you can't really instill in
somebody that's never been through it themselves well we keep going the way we're going i think
all of us are going to get to experience it here if we don't get our shit together fast you know
we're printing money like crazy we still haven't recovered from what happened two three years ago
new york city my friend the way things are looking i'm gonna have to leave my own city
things are just out of control everywhere right now and people really need to like we need to like
rope this in enough with the division i understand there's two very different ideologies out there
right now but if we don't find a way to come in the middle somewhere we're all in trouble and we
all go down so you know i agree with you there's nothing like going through a trauma or an experience
to to really light a fire under someone it's either going to destroy you completely right or it's
or it's going to make it right exactly when it makes you like it really makes you yeah right when
you win so for me one of those life changing events for me for example is like when i lost
my brother right that type of trauma i came out a completely different person it's like being put
into a pressure cooker right when you go through something where you lose something or something
horrible happens to you you either can choose to live the rest of your life destroyed which
unfortunately a lot of people do they go towards drugs or alcohol whatever the case may be because
they can't handle the pain or you embrace that pain you tell yourself mentally no matter what
i'm never going to give up it might take me years to get back up it took me years to get back up
and and you use that pain for fuel and that's i think that's what a lot of immigrants do they
say hey i went through all this crap right i lost all this my family went through all this and if i
give up now you're alive today whoever you are watching this show or listening right now you're
alive because guaranteed someone in your lineage and most of us came and go back three generations
someone definitely went through something horrible roman empire whatever empires someone in your
lineage survived trauma beyond your comprehension for you to be alive right now to have the chance
that you have right now somebody your great great grandfather your great great grandmother
suffered in a way wherever whatever part of the world you come from went through a living hell
for you to be alive today risking your life to come on one of those boats from europe
500 years ago you said goodbye to somebody you didn't know if you're ever gonna see them again
and most of the time you didn't so someone in your ancestry went through a living nightmare
for you to have the chance right now that you're throwing in the garbage
and if you can instill anything so i think people need to like i think everyone's preoccupied with
just stupidity man take a step back focus think you're alive it's a blessing you can breathe
that's a blessing if you're healthy that's an extra blessing some of the most positive people
i've met in my life who have done more than people that have two arms and two legs i know people
have they can't even walk they've done more with their life than people that have everything
so it's not being grateful not learning from mistakes not knowing what you want the hardest
thing in life is not to make it it's knowing what you want because once you know what you want
whether it's to be the best podcaster in the world a music whatever once you know most people
either know and they're scared to go after it or they haven't fully committed to going after it
because there's nothing for free man whether you're paying with tears sweat money everything comes
out of sacrifice and most people are not willing to lose in order to win they're scared they're
fear and we've all been there i've been there at times in my life too so i'm not going to
sit here and act like i'm some amazing human being who hasn't made mistakes or doesn't have fear
but i try to learn from mistakes from people in my life from situations i've witnessed like
visiting kosovo before the war visiting kosovo after the war and seeing it completely burned
to the ground every single house pretty much an entire nation was destroyed and to not take
advantage of that opportunity that i have here in the us to not be grateful for it and when a
setback comes it's like hey dude your family's been through worse your friends over there have
been through worse and they don't give up how you're gonna give up right you can't give up
and so many people that migrate from some of those places overseas or even from Mexico
like you were talking about with julian on the podcast with him is that a lot of these immigrants
are the backbone of america they're the ones that keep the infrastructure going the ones that are
doing the blue collar like the blue collar work digging ditches bro they're the ones not digging
ditches but you know what i mean they're doing things you don't want to do they're the go to any
construction site when they're pouring concrete they're all fucking immigrants the whole fucking
world is made of concrete they're the ones that are doing the shit that no one wants to do
it's fact you know but do i think we have a little bit of an issue right now like the way
people are coming in i think is way like you know there needs to be some type of regulation you
can't just for sure you can topple an empire that way yeah change demographics in a way
you know go to other countries you see how the immigration policies are i mean we still have
the most lenient immigration policy people come here the you know not the legal way and they still
get their papers they still get their citizenship plenty of albanians have done it also they came
here they you know political asylum or whatever the case may be they got their papers right so
i'm not saying people should go that route and my family came here legally my my mom's family
my grandfather escaped communist albania he was hunted on by the communist he had to get out of
there he made it to roam and he was granted a visa through amnesty international which is how
they got to the to new york the bronx that's where my my mom's family started was in the bronx new york
which is where little albania is today and my dad came because my uncle married a amazing jewish woman
in uh crecia at the time they met fell in love she brought him to texas and then they did the
visa for my dad so you know both of my parents did immigrate here legally but many people came
however they had to come and you know it's hard to judge those people and it's hard to not feel
sympathetic for them listen the overwhelming majority of those people coming over the border
are not bad people that's a fact they just like where they live is a hell where they're coming from
is conflict right poverty whatever it is me and to not feel for them you're not a human being
but we also have to protect the interests of our nation and make sure that things are done
the right way because this can really backfire big time so it's like a catch 22 you know how
does it make you feel when you watch the news and you see like the things that are going on in
conflicts with like ukrainian russia so it's a very dangerous time for albania also serbia is
basically the sister of russia and last week serbia massed their forces on the kosovo border
since since the kosovo war ended so over 20 years ago as just last week they had all their forces on
the border of northern kosovo and they're talking all this rhetoric i mean we're still under the
protection of nato but what's to say that they don't do the same thing they did to afghanistan
and just leave us in the lord if they leave us in the lurch we're finished but we're in big trouble
so i think there could be a conflict in the balkans again maybe russia tells serbia start a war
or whatever the case may be in this conflict this conflict in the ukraine has the potential to pull
the entire world into it on a level i don't think any of us really comprehend
and russia can't afford to lose that war so i don't i think we're far from ending it i hope
they do find a way to end it my heart goes out to the average ukrainian i can only imagine what
they're going through but there's a lot of crap going on i think most of us don't even realize
what's going on and no one really knows what's the real reason sometimes things happen yeah that's
a that's a difficult thing right like you were talking about earlier propaganda most people watch
the news like fox and cnn to get to understand what's going on in the world and they're just
competing for views they're just fucking trying to come up with it's all opinion crazy headlines
just to compete for views and for clicks and they oh they both put their own spin on it and then
if you want to even go deeper than that if you want to understand what the leaders of these other
countries are saying they're it's in a different fucking language how are you going to understand
it how are you going to like are you going to trust what the first line the first level is the
translation like is it being translated accurately the second level is the news taking it putting it
through their blender and then recycling it and regurgitating it on tv but that's usually what's
happening yeah you just said right there's like i said ask yourself when's the last time you got
to see a world leader outside the u.s talking uninhibited and you get to formulate your own
opinion i can't remember the last time i seen you can you so you might get a little blip just a
little they said this and they'll take one line that fits their narrative the closest thing i ever
saw which i don't know when it came out maybe like five or six years ago but it was uh the
putin interviews with oliver stone where he went he did like a four-part documentary where he went
and interviewed putin like he interviewed him for like six hours it was six hours edited but it was
you know he spent weeks on end with spending entire days with him talking to him about things and
his perspective on america was kind of mind blowing if for someone who hasn't really ever
listened to the guy talk and i grew up only hearing you know america spin on russia and hearing his
perspective on the united states was very very eye-opening to say the least i mean he talks about
and that's another thing is he has survived through so many presidents right so he has this
perspective on trump on bush on clinton on obama and i mean the guy's basically a dictator let's
go on what it is he's not relinquishing power right now before him russia was a joke but right
like right you compare yeltsin to him right yeltsin was drunk this guy's like shirt off horseback
judo like let's go yeah he fought wars against chechnya he invaded george like the guys much you
can't even compare him to yeltsin right you know and then when they lost mcdonald's last year i don't
think the russians were crying i wish the same thing happened we could lose mcdonald's i think
mcdonald's is hurting us no offense making these yeah but i mean he said he said you know when you
talk about the history of america and russia you know we've just been instigating with nato pointing
you know having they're completely surrounded i mean that's they're surrounded with these
missile sites that are supposed to be defensive missile sites but they can be converted into
offensive missile sites in the matter of minutes it's literally a button it's not a good thing
you just say okay attack right i don't think you need to do anything i think you just say push
so like that's one thing i don't think a lot of americans understand and again i'm you got to be
fair even with nations that are hostile towards you if you look at the whole picture are they
completely surrounded they are you know so do i know what happens you know i think there's a lot
at play i think our currency is at risk i don't see the dollar surviving if we continue what we're
doing right now unless we pay down this deficit immediately i think the play is into crypto i
think that is the end game and i think there are powers that manipulate that are not in the
interest of the us and we don't need to get into all that most people know what i'm talking about so
what are you talking about i just think there's a lot of people that are in power that do not
have the interest of our nation first they make interest based on the interest of their group
their people whoever they are what you know people have different names them but you know what i'm
talking about yeah people say oh it's a theory a c theory right conspiracy theory yeah so yes i
tend to lean towards that because a lot of the stuff that goes on doesn't make sense man it's
not in our interest why are we doing it that's that's like kind of the point i was making about
Putin where it's yeah he's a dictator he's not relinquishing power and that's bad right but
is it good that we just have a brand new person to run our country every four years or every eight
years that has to learn the job and get elected through this joke of a political system that we
have here these two binary options that we have that are it's and then fox news tells you to vote
this way and CNN tells you to vote that way it's just like a fucking circus really and then if you
don't want to vote for either what's your vote i mean like what is it is it would it be better to
have a president for 10 years versus four years i don't know it's actually a great question i mean
i don't know either i don't know why there has to be you know given that we have secure elections
and everything like that right and we should probably nix that word because i don't probably
killed algorithm but getting back to the point you know i don't i don't have a problem if the
american people vote for someone to stay in power for 25 years and are doing a good job who cares
you know like if you know we had this extraordinary leader and we keep voting the masses vote for him
who cares but it's still a democracy and you're still voting for that person to stay in power
why break something that's amazing if we have a human being who puts us first and cares to me a
leader is someone who's willing to sacrifice themselves for their people if we use that
definition to describe a leader you don't have not one in washington dc right you don't have a
single leader and it's so it's so obvious that the people that are in power in america what no
matter who they are whether it be the president or any of these other given politician senators
whatever they all want that really badly like they started in this weird system of the one who
seeks power yeah exactly the one who wants it is the one who should not have it a true leader is
the one that is such an amazing person that the masses say no you need to do it like you need to
be the one you know you have a divine responsibility if you're a spiritual person when you're a leader
you're put in control of every single living creature under your realm you're accountable for it
if a tree gets cut down for no reason that's on you you're literally in charge of every living
creature under your rule and every resource and if these things are being squandered and not
used appropriately and not used for the benefits of the masses and you're making decisions that are
only for you and your friends you're not a leader you're an evil criminal this is what you are you
are not a leader a leader is one who is so humble they're willing to sacrifice themselves for the
hive and we don't have a single politician in this entire nation except you know maybe the guy
that she's doing a pretty good job here man where you guys live but other than that the Santas yeah
the rest of them you know i'm not here to get into the little squandering of what you believe
ideologically with birth and i'm talking about just what he did for your state yeah absolutely
volatile time ever to keep you guys afloat where you've become one of the most desired places to
live your property value skyrocket your employment is stable i'm driving around and life is normal
in the midst of what it was the biggest storm we've ever seen on our shores you know to me
he has the leaders he has the the characteristics of a leader you're not going to agree with everything
he does right but the overwhelming decisions he's made have benefited your state and every
person that lives in this you think he runs against trump i think he'd be stupid not to
i'd vote for him i wouldn't yeah he seems much more disciplined he's just much more level-headed
very respectful person but very calm you know listen again some people hate some of the certain
issues that are very touchy right now so she would reproduction and all that stuff but as far as what
he does for the state and for the people and for business the guys the guys he's a freaking rock
star bro he really is he's amazing how do you think this gets fixed how do you think we fixed
the problem in america with the leadership and there was a song that came out in the eighties
i kind of i think it was micah the mechanics all i need is a miracle all i need is help
we're i don't know i don't know i don't have an answer for that one but i think the responsibility
comes back to each individual american to educate themselves to be open-minded to be scared when
conversations are suppressed because that has always been the first step to tyranny in any society
when you see even if you hate the other group and you can't stand their ideals their principles
whatever the case may be when you allow them to be silenced you are next you idiot you will be
next to be silenced so these are the red flags that scare me as someone that comes from a part
of a world where that was the norm and if you've voiced your opinion you disappeared in the middle
of the night so any shape or form of that even creeping into our society whether it's through
social media whether it's through policies and laws must be turned down must be defeated
must not happen everyone should be able to voice their opinion the way me and you're talking right
now you can either choose to listen or not but when we do not allow these conversations to happen
we're in a very very dangerous predicament have you experienced any on your podcast which is amazing
by the way um have you experienced any kind of not even close to yours Danny what are you talking
about you're just fantastic man but you're Joe Rogan level bro you know come on stop it dude
you really are like i'm first of all i wanted to thank you i'm honored to be on the show and
but you look at the cast of of people that you have an eye for picking out amazing guests i'm
not just saying that because i'm on here so it's not to like i feel like i won the lottery by being
here today so it's amazing to talk to i love talking to people like you you know not only
people that have grown up and experienced the things that you've experienced and have a very
unique perspective on human beings and cultures and different countries your perspective is so unique
and then on top of that you know you grew up in new york city which is people who just spent a lot
of time in new york they they always seem to be the most fun to talk to it was a blessing living
there man my entire life like i love my city and the fact that i might have to turn my back on her
when even on you know everything i went through on september 2001 yeah didn't make me leave right
and where you were there underneath the towers yeah i was on the e-train i was on the e-train
beautiful day and i go you know underneath there's like the whole subway system so i i i end up
underneath the the building's not realizing that they're on fire i was going to pace university
it's about two blocks it's in the shadows of the world trade and the subway doors open and
i hear screaming and yelling and i'm a sophomore in college so i'm about 19 years old and i'm like
i remember just being excited for a split second like you know like a young dumb man like you know
like hey billy there's a fire let's go look at the fire so i remember for like a split second like
hearing people screaming and yelling i'm like oh there's probably a fight going on or something
stupid i didn't think hey dude the the building's on fire above you you know what i mean so i get out
of the subway as i'm getting to surface level i hear another oh my god that was when the second
plane was hitting i didn't get to see either of them but i remember i put you into my mind later
i realized that when everyone was yelling that second that was when the second plane was hitting
make the story short but i get out of the subway and it's snowing outside but it's like 80 degrees
out and i'm like and i look up and i could not believe what i was seeing i don't know how close
were you to the towers like where you are literally underneath them direct like like right under like
i came out from the e everyone that lives in york knows e trains last stop world trade
you know world trade so like i came out from beneath those towers i was in the subway network
under them and you know it was man it was crazy and you know make the story short i ended up
walking all the way to bay ridge brooklyn over the brooklyn bridge halfway over the bridge the
earth trembles and the towers come down you know i want to remind people of something because it
kind of plays a role in what's going on today in the aftermath of what happened after those
buildings fell half of my school like dropped out because we're so close and the trauma that they
witnessed a lot of them couldn't process it so you smelt burning metal right a smell i'll never
forget as long as i live and we were told the air was safe and don't worry and the whole time i got
my guard up now that's the one time i should have wore a mask yeah right look because it works for
that particles right and i remember being so worried that eventually about a couple weeks
after i ended up bleeding a walkout in my college and i was calling the students to action because
i was like i feel like the air is not safe that we're breathing even though they're telling us it is
and i ended up meeting with the president at the time and then there was like some people from the
epa if i'm not mistaken they were there and they were giving us all these reports and we put
HEPA filters and like don't worry we guarantee your air is safe now the EPA was in charge of
making sure we were safe it was under the watch of christine Todd Whitman who was the former governor
of new jersey and they were wrong she issued an apology 10 years later we were wrong we're sorry
more people have died from getting sickness related to breathing that air and then died in that building
there's a multi-billion dollar fund today that i'm even eligible for which i've never claimed because
so far i'm healthy thank god but plenty of people are getting 50 60 100 200 000 dollars from this
multi-billion dollar fund which was created many years after the events that took place because
they promised us the air was safe the same way they're promising us right now that yeah yeah
they're safe the things that you're putting into your body right now are safe when no one knows
long term what it does to you i was already lied to about my health and promised i would be safe
why would i ever trust them again right and that's my argument with the one thing that we can't
talk about because no one will see the damn episode but we're in america right mic drop back
yeah i mean that's real man that's that's real shit this happened that's a real event here you
want proof that you can't trust they did it in downtown new york millions of fire you know not
thousands of people yeah respiratory illnesses lungs cancers of every sort and kind thank god that
cloud that cloud you know the cloud that came after the buildings fell yeah if i hadn't left when i
left tsunami if i hadn't left when i left because it went all the way to the brooklyn bridge like
over the east river i was just far enough away where like it didn't get me because if i were to
breathe any of that in i guarantee anyone that breathed in the death cloud i call it the death
cloud yeah that was glass asbestos dust whatever the hell went into that they all ended up dying
bro or getting like really bad respiratory infections and cancers and you had people
going to saunas and they were sweating blue and green bro what oh yeah man this is a fact everyone
knows that sweating blue and blue and green man firefighters there's videos of it man
yeah i had the guy uh tim mcbrough shot out to the firefighters man and the low enforcement
when we were going over that bridge running for our lives these guys were heading into
to harm's way and they never made it out man i'll never forget that image yeah i'm going over
the bridge the fire trucks are going in going in these men and women never came back out man
some of those people man that were there some of those firefighters and and people those
rescuers that were there that day are today really fucked up that's what i missed though see
as horrible as that event was the aftermath was amazing we were never more united as a country
new yorkers were like brother and sister like together like
like we had a trauma happen to us and we like pulled through we were closer than ever
proud to be from new york the Yankee everyone was a Yankees fan or a brooklyn fan and then
when i compared to what's happened three years ago with all the chaos the sickness that the
sickness that shut us down then all the political stuff that happened and then the basically new
yorkers turning their back on the police you know and to see how divided we are and how many
new yorkers left man they say in 500 000 brother if i had to estimate one to two million left new
york city really i don't care what they say in the news i know my city don't show me a couple
images of time square busy because you drive through i'm i'm getting back and forth all over new
york in 15 20 minutes that was never the case bro i don't care if uh you know time square gets a
little busy and people like all new york's back no it's not back those corporate buildings are still
empty some people have gone back i have family that works uh on on 57th street they haven't been back
to their office in three years this one of the biggest companies and i don't want to say what
industry but very big company that if i mentioned their name you'll know exactly who they are and
they haven't gone back that's the core of manhand now they're talking about maybe we should convert
these office buildings into residential that means your city the city that i knew the city that
terrorists couldn't destroy right is never coming back to what i knew it as it's gone i'm
never gonna see it again i posted today on my instagram i made a video about it i don't think
i'll ever see the new york that i knew and to me it's devastating i love my city i love like you
said growing up there do you know why i love new york because i may never feel safe enough to go
to afghanistan but if i wanted to learn about the afghani people i can go to the afghani restaurant
on ninth avenue sit down with mohammed explain to me about his family fought the russians and then
he made it out alive and and i get to experience this culture and the food and it's authentic as
hell as if i was in kaboom and i've been all over the world man ain't nobody touching new york's food
it's like you want authentic everything and you have this fusion of amazing things that happen and
and and one thing that really stood out to me is like one day i'm watching i'm at the park watching
my kid and i see this hasidic jewish woman she's covered you know the way they the hasidims are and
i see this middle eastern woman this arab woman she's covered you know the way muslims cover
and they're standing right next to each other their kids are playing at the park and i'm like on the
other side of the world they might be killing each other right but here wow okay here you know
i never thought i'd have a you know a serbian friend i made one it took me a long time right
because everything happened to me the trauma to be bigger and to understand that we can't judge
everyone and put everyone into one basket and that we need to grow as people and as a society
to to to just kind of like you gotta remember everyone's gonna try to defend their own first and
even if you're right they've been put through propaganda they're not gonna believe your version
of events and like when we stop talking that's when bullets start flying and to see people
in new york city who i know would be killing each other hate each other their kids are playing
together where the hell else can you do that but here man i've been to other parts of the country
europe is not as open as we are man you visit places in germany they you know and no offense
says i've been to germany 30 times i didn't feel the warmth as much you know so that's what i'm
telling people like i understand we have a lot of things we need to fix but it shouldn't be let's
take out what we got let's destroy everything let's destroy our history let's wipe everything out
if we don't know our own if we don't leave listen you make the same mistakes again you need things
to remind you of the past this is what we did this is wrong let's never let it happen again
you know i feel like we took so many steps forward as a society and then we just took
like 10 back and it's crazy yeah some of the people that were born and raised in america
though they don't have that perspective it's very few people have the perspective that you have
and are familiar with that you know i mean you know how much work it takes to actually like
i know just a little bit of it from doing hundreds of these interviews but the normal
person who works at nine to five working wherever they work working at their job going you know or
working at home dealing with whatever they have to deal with every day they don't have the time to
pay attention to all this stuff like you got to fucking get your news somewhere like where's the
what's the quickest and most effective way to get your news like twitter or turn on the tv for
a few minutes and it's impossible it's impossible to understand all the shit that's going on and
know the truth behind it you know i'm friends with one of the biggest comedians in the world
gentlemen shout out to mazder brony shout out to tayran out in l.a these guys are amazing comics
right and right now they're in a cash 22 their people are in trouble there was a woman who wasn't
quote on quote wearing the islamic attire correctly so they ended up killing this young
woman and it sparked massive protests in iran right for the freedom that many americans take
for granted right and people are dying they're being rounded up they're scheduled to like execute
thousands of people that were dissidents like protesting against us you know i can go protest
anything i want right now i don't got to worry about being rounded up you know what i mean so
you know being exposed like where where can you like you have access to everything man yeah you
have access to so many cultures instead of like listening to what people tell you about people
why don't you go meet those people man yeah why don't you go sit down and have a cup of coffee
to say listen you know during 9 11 we witnessed a lot of people turning their backs on certain
communities and that wasn't the right way either they're not listen i could say i'm this i'm that
islam doesn't teach you to blow up a building right that's a fact it doesn't tell you to first of all
if you take your own life in that religion you're supposedly you're punished for eternity
doing the act that you did one out of five people's muslim
if they were all terrorists the way some of us were treating these people in the us we would
have we would have had a much bigger problem than 9 11 i promise isn't it like it's like almost
high point eight billion it's like the second schedule to surpass christianity because of
birth rates right okay and what's sad is that christians and muslims actually have more in
common than anything else they both believe in jesus they believe he's the messiah they believe he's
coming back to earth muslims even believe in an antichrist the same way christians do the only
difference between a christian and a muslim is that christians believe jesus was god or a part of
god through the trinity muslims say no god is one jesus was just another line of the prophets
he was created the same way adam was created adam didn't have a father or a mother jesus was
created the same way john the baptist was created john the baptist parents based on biblical
scripture didn't have intercourse how did you learn about all this i've studied theology for 25 years
my friend what do you think the biggest misconception is of muslims in the united states i think they
you know let's be real these same people now on the right who tell you everything's propaganda
were the same ones pushing propaganda against the muslims for right so like when people say
what are you i'm neither man i am someone who likes to critically think if i had to classify
myself as something politically i would say i'm a libertarian i'm a libertarian who leans a little
bit towards the right but i also have like listen do what you want to do man this is america bang
what you want to bang leave me and my kids alone i don't give a shit what you do with your life as
long as you're not hurting me like live and let live that's my overall ideal yeah everyone minds
your own damn business go to work pay your taxes not too much because they shouldn't be taxing as
the way they are i want a smaller government not in every single aspect of my life that's that america
wasn't founded on those ideals that's that's where it reminds me of overseas and what i saw when
they're too much into our lives these people are supposed to be servants not our dictators not the
ones commanding our lives so i would say the misconception people have is that when's the
last time you've ever seen a movie in hollywood that ever portrays a middle easterner as a good person
you've never seen a movie that makes an arab look like a good guy ever name one
yeah you're right so what i'm saying is you've been programmed to view these people as hostile
you're talking about one point almost one point five it's like one point five to one point eight i
mean who really has a clicker they can kind of recently i never said where they get these like
numbers there's nine billion do we really know there's nine billion people i mean do we really
know yeah this country's where they don't even have senses you know right so you've been conditioned
to look i always say meet people where they're at man you know when these horrible things happened
there was a lot of people that did a lot of extraordinary work to build bridges between
these communities one of them is hamza yusuf this is a guy that converted to islam his original
name was david hanson he's the founder of the zaytuna instant institute out in burbank california
an amazing human being who's built bridges between all communities and faiths he was
president during the burial of Muhammad Ali him and i believe the guy's name was i forgot
my brain's fried here man but my point is it's when conversation breaks down it's when you give
voice and and and and put people under a microscope and you're focusing on the worst element of them
hmm 1.8 billion you know yeah they're basically the propaganda was we just applied the ideals of a
couple guys in a cave to an entire enormous religion a vast body a guy that we supported and
trained for a long time i mean we got to tell the whole story bro that's a lot of that's a guy
that we are that's a long story and also like it's like let's look at the whole picture but
i saw instances where like they were misquoting you know verses from the Quran who was misquoting
verses mainstream media really one was like kill the infidel kill the infidel strike their next
wherever you find them yes that does say that in the book but guess what that in the book yeah
but they're not talking about christians and in that passage god's not even talking to the muslims
he's talking to the angels that verse that they loved using in the mainstream media about how they
need to kill the infidel christians were not considered infidels in islam who are they talking
about they were talking about the other pagan Arabs that were trying to destroy the prophet
Muhammad who was bringing monotheism who was telling people god is one believe in Abraham
moses jesus these are all prophets of god these people are praying to statues and a million different
gods they're the infidels they're the pagans so in that verse they were at a battle if i'm not
mistaken it was called badr it was the battle of badr and historically they were outnumbered three
to one so the the first muslims were outnumbered three to one and god says in the Quran he commands
the angels go and support the forces because they're outnumbered and i commanded the angels to strike
the infidels he wasn't even commanding the muslims and they use that verse in the mainstream media
to make you think as an american that the muslims are coming to kill you but i'll give you a quote
that it does say speak kindly to the christian for they are the closest to you in faith amongst
them you will find men of reason and education that's in the holy Quran when's the last time you
saw that on the news never so how you're gonna judge brother i've had so many conversations
about religion most christians don't even know that jesus spoke armaic they don't know that the
word for god pull it up i dare you right now on google type in language of jesus christ do it right
now on google show me what pow let's show you how dumb we are as a society and how far away you are
listening to this right now how far away you are from any concept of reality truth or or being so
what was the language there pops up now here's what i want you to let me blow everybody's mind
now aramaic aramaic now the language is a semitic language the semitic languages are hebrew
arabic and aramaic their cousins like i mentioned earlier latin is portuguese italian spanish
semitic languages now i want you to type this in aramaic word for god and watch what pops up
and let me teach you a lesson the aramaic word for god well if that's the language of christ i
should know now what's the first search result read it say i know it's hard to say it say it
where is the search result coming from in blue ala oh jesus christ in his own language called god
ilah ilah allah it's not a name it's a cognate so in hebrew it's Elohim or ilah in arabic it's
it's a word that's the same in three languages it's not a name al means the law means god it's the
same word in the language of jesus christ but during 9 11 all you heard people saying in
new york city was f these muslims and f there yeah that's called ignorance where they would
realize they have much more in common than they don't and that they're being perpetrated against
each other no one wins in conflict nobody wins in war muslims and christians and jews are brothers
their cousins the fact that they fight each other's a disgrace you cannot fight a christian or fight
a jew and call yourself a jew or muslim or christian you're neither you're nothing and if this group
of people could just figure this out aray that's half the world brother that's half the world right
there right you cannot kill a christian and call yourself a muslim you cannot kill a muslim and
call yourself a christian period i don't care what kings did and emperors did your relationship
with the creators between you and god and you have the book and if you don't know how to read
then learn how to read and you make your own opinion but this should show you just how little
people know about their own faith and they want to talk to you about islam or judeism or buddhism
so when you're ignorant and you're getting all your opinions from news and from this and from
that what do we have left to talk about i can't even sit at the table and have a real conversation
with you because you're not on my level how you're gonna talk to me hi people i want to
debate you in religion you don't know your own religion how you're gonna debate me i'll quote
your book left and right you can't quote mine so that's the whole point you got to meet people
where they're at so when you're dealing with someone that's dumb dumb it down when you're
someone that's on your level then you have the conversation because unfortunately most people
can't even handle it knowledge is very powerful information is very powerful the way you get it
the first question people should ask them where am i getting my information from who's the author of
this who's the one telling me who am i listening to let me read their biography on wikipedia if
that's even accurate let me see who they are right because information has the power to do amazing
things or when it's used we saw what it did in world war two when people are getting the information
from a guy with a little mustache who brainwashed the nation to wipe out millions of people
information is so powerful you need to know where you're getting it from where's the source
where's the the proof that this is accurate so i just wish that when these things happen people
would say you know let me go down to the local mosque let me talk to the guy is this what you
guys believe instead they were pulling out poor Sikhs out of there they're not even Muslim they
were pouring them pouring them out of their cabs and beating the living crap out of them someone
even got killed just because the stereotype is a beard and a so this is ignorance man
this is ignorance most people that live in this country 99 who came from wherever they came from
my friend owns the russian samovar because we're talking about ukraine
shout out to yasha misha okay their families mix their jewish ukrainian and russian their
family came here a long time ago they own one of the most recognizable russian establishments in
all of new york city in america it's called the russian samovar it's on 52nd street between
eighth and broadway these poor people went through the struggles of you know the last three years
with all the shutdowns you know what that did to hospitality in new york completely killed it it
almost wiped it out completely so imagine you get through all of that then the war breaks out in
ukraine and now everyone's boycotting your restaurant because it starts with russian meanwhile
you're american so and you're of ukrainian descent also he puts a huge ukrainian flag
in front of his restaurant we're against the war and it's a ghost town for the first couple of
months during this conflict and i go to see them because they're my friends i'm never tell my back
of my friends and they're like beck it's crazy man so eventually the word got out they're like no
they don't support it they did fundraisers they get message from over there that they can never go
back to russia so it's like you know just because somebody's from a certain place that maybe you
don't traditionally like or you come from originally doesn't mean that they're like those people or
whatever they're they're here man right i'm american first i was born and raised in this country first
i will fight and die for this country first because i'm american first but people came here
they came for the same reasons you came they were oppressed they had things that went on in russia
i heard a lot of jews were not treated well during the soviet union that's why they came to the us
so now we're gonna treat our fellow american in new york that owns a russian you know restaurant
like a criminal and a piece of crap and meanwhile he doesn't even support the war so like this is
what i call stupidity ignorance and prejudging people and we see it all the time additionally
there's so many people that just haven't traveled and haven't been places and like one of the most
absurd examples of this to me is people in the kkk i had a uh there goes this episode i had a guy
on i had a guy on here who uh who was a black guy and he ended up meeting and befriending
it wasn't he the guy that would like always try to like the program them or whatever like he would
meet them i've seen that guy exactly extraordinary yeah and he became build bridges he became very
good friends with a couple of guys that were in the kkk and he said and this you know um
he originally spent lots of time like lots of time over in europe and overseas um in his like
brave person like in high school and then he came back here when he was like you know after high school
and what the most comp like the lowest common denominator of all those people in the kkk
is they had never fucking left the 10 mile radius they were born in they had never fucking even
went to the neighboring state let alone another country to meet anybody so you're in a very close
microcosm you only get information from a very limited source of course you're gonna think that way
you know most people i like to believe that everyone is darryl darryl davis that was his name
correct i'm like a mustache yeah big big guy you know it's again it's getting back to information
when you you're limited in where you're getting your information this is why they limit
what you see in the news in cuba this is like this is the whole point so if we start doing
this type of stuff in the u.s i don't care if it starts on social media it's a privately owned
corporation well you know what technically it has become the the the arena of speech yes i know
it's private privately owned but guess what the impact that it has on society the impact that it
has on us there needs to be a way to protect speech on these platforms i don't care who you are they
have too much influence too much power to sway public opinion so to allow one group to be suppressed
on there for their views is dangerous i don't care if you're left and you hate the right it goes
both ways if you allow one or the other you both will go down right that's a fact right it's happened
throughout history um you know you use one group until you get the rest of them on your side it's
the same thing that adolf did right he started one group and then he took out the rest so it's like
you have to protect this these platforms have become where our squares where we would speak
publicly and have these debates that's what that's what social media is now so that needs to be
protected i don't give a damn if it's a private corporation do you have any sort of optimism
about social media with elon and twitter i don't trust the guy as far as i can throne really you
know why is that i'm not all about this neural link stuff bro no there can there be some benefits
i think everything needs to be looked at from a dual perspective and murphy's law i'm not saying
he's a bad dude but my perception of him is i feel like he is either a not as in our favor as you
think he is and that'll come out later or b he's like the scientist in judgment day two terminator
he's like the black scientist remember in the movie they're trying to go and get the arm and
destroy it and they blow up the whole office building yeah i think he's like that scientist
like he's so happy that he's making the first terminator he doesn't realize what it's gonna
do to us later right and i feel like if elon is doesn't have malicious intent the stuff that he's
playing with can impact humanity in ways that could destroy us he is one of the most outspoken
people about the dangers of ai which is great like i said i'm not saying he's bad i'm saying i just
still with a grain of salt because he has so much power and influence it can go either way
and just because he owns twitter doesn't mean it's always going to stay free speech or that people
are not getting from me like everything you type in there why do you think it says what do you think
when ai combines with everything you've ever input on social media they're gonna know you
better than you know your own self and i agree with you if he's speaking out against that that's
great there's a lot i love about the guy i'm just saying i don't fully trust him yet he hasn't earned
my full trust yeah because what he's in charge of and what he's responsible for in so many ways
first of all a private citizen corporation has control of our space program like why did nasa
close basically if i'm not mistaken they defunded nasa and this guy what i understand his technology
was way ahead did he really come up with that or was he like i don't trust the whole i don't trust
i don't trust bitcoin i mean that that's a good example of it's just weird you know the
capitalism beats i know but you're talking about government a government funded program
a guy with a company figured out how to cut the fat how to do it more effectively how to do it
better how to do it cheaper and he had that that drive that ambition to to make it that's the story
they told you so you fall in love with this guy i think he's tony stark yeah no i mean like if people
believe this and i'm sorry to cut you off if people believe the story of yagamatsu whatever
the guy from japan that invented bitcoin bullshit if the youth understood what can happen with bitcoin
and how blockchain really works unless i'm wrong and correct me if i am i think the whole plays
towards crypto they'll never allow something they can't control but if they had to let people fall
in love with the idea and get used to using it and see these big returns and now they introduce
the one that they can control the one that's going to tell you how much meat you can buy
and they tie it into global warming and social credit score that's where this is all going my
brother worse than communism could have ever been as horrible as it was that's my fear so keeping that
on the front stage front and center okay cool i like technology i like advancing great everything
has two sides the way it could be used it could be used for good or bad the internet in my opinion
is doing more destruction now than good yes there's a lot of great that came from it everything
has two ways it can be used for good or for bad you can use your phone to look at porn all day
or you can use your phone to read study google hey you want to talk to me about religion it takes
you five seconds to do some basic facts on jesus christ i just showed you one of them for example
i took you two seconds to learn something you probably didn't know about them right most people
are not using it for the second person they're using it to degenerate themselves they become
lower vibrational human beings they're not they're using it for the census the only difference
between a human being and an animal from the spiritual explanation of it we share the same
anatomy as animals as monkeys as pigs the pig is one of the closest to us but what separates us from
them is our souls our spirit when a human being only acts upon their desires they are lower than
the animal because they have intellect if all i do is eat drink suck and fall like tony montana
all we got to do is eat and drink and suck and fuck right tony montana like you said that one
scene yeah is this all there is to a life money huh eating drinking sake and if that's all that a
human being does you are lower than an animal and most people in our society that's all they do
eat drink suck fuck yeah consume content that doesn't benefit them content like this benefits
them that's why the work that you do is so important the people that you have on sharing
their experiences their lives what they've been through these are things that will benefit
you if you know nothing about life nothing about people people never even heard of albania probably
today they learned something where are you spending your time you have a responsibility with the gift
that you've been given time is the most precious asset and most people throw it right into the
garbage and i'm guilty of it too i've procrastinated much in my life but the duality is what scares
me what what it could be i always i what could it be used for and maybe that's the fear from the
trauma of knowing what my family went through what could happen how tyranny can creep in
how things that were created to liberate us have actually started to enslave us and i think this is
the greatest example of it this is a weapon of mass envy mass envy if you look at my my instagram
you're like this guy has the most amazing life in the world this guy lives like a rock star
but there's been times i posted on there i'm in paradise i'm crying in my hotel room bro
and that's the truth because you're only seeing what i put on there and the good stuff you're not
seeing the bad stuff yeah so you're creating this environment where everyone feels like they're
behind i'm not doing good in life my life sucks there's a lot of responsibility that
comes with this technology brother that i think the majority of us are failing with
and i have even given a term to the society that we live in i call this generation the easter bunny
generation what does that mean this is either gonna be the smartest thing you've ever heard
you're gonna say this guys the easter bunny generation during Easter when we go to the
store and we buy all the stuff for Easter one of the things we buy are the easter bunny chocolates
right right a lot of those chocolates are what inside they're hollow right during Easter a lot
of those chocolates you have like caramel inside yeah you could get the solid ones but a lot of
the ones that they give you like they stuffed about their hollow you literally bite into them
and they're empty right they look great on the outside they're empty on the inside
it's the same thing with this generation everything is beautiful on the exterior every
moment of my life is handcrafted to make my life look amazing but deep down inside they've never
been more depressed than they are now one in 12 americans on antidepressants people are suffering
suicide rates are through the roof and it's gotta lead you but i'm looking at this i've lost friends
to suicide that just looking at their lives on instagram but that's how i see them i don't know
i don't see them every day whenever i saw them they seemed happy i look online they seem amazing
taking their own lives married with children i lost a friend i couldn't believe i lost two
years i couldn't believe how his life ended i would have never seen the warning signs
it's the easter bunny generation brother beautiful on the outside empty on the inside
i also heard you used the term generation of bastards
yo you went deep huh what does that mean so i gotta take down some of this content before i
get taken down but basically brother from a spiritual perspective you need both parents
to raise a child the right way right divorce has never been higher and most what is the
divorce rate is the divorce rate really the highest in the u.s it's it's very high man
you know in like listen divorce was like unthinkable in the albany culture 30 years ago
now it's normal people would have like families would have gotten into blood wars
over honor for divorce like guns were drawn when people got divorced and now it's like not a big
deal so that just shows you from that ancient society how things have changed let alone here in
the u.s but what i mean by a generation generation of bastards is that so many children are born out
of wedlock now in the old days if somebody called you a bastard you'd break their jaw
someone called you a bastard there was nothing look at the old look at the films where they show
people and like in like medieval european right he's the bastard he's the bastard of sir john
elliot the third yeah and like game of thrones john snow was the bastard so like to be called the
bastard was like you're a lowlife basically right and i'm not saying that you are if you are one
but what i mean by that is that you don't have the proper parental guidance so many children
are born out of wedlock men are not being men i don't care if you marry the woman or not you
brought that child into this earth you have a responsibility to that woman into that child
to make sure that they're okay to make sure that they're being raised properly that you have a
social responsibility not only to them because you brought them into the world but to society
and the problem is so many children now are born out of wedlock they're full of rage brother
they've done most of these violent crimes if you study them statistically are committed by
children from a single parent home most violent crime sexual crime look up the i know my stuff
i get rusty sometimes because i store too much information okay is committed by children from
a single parent home so this is why we see the rage why we're seeing the stuff that's happening
in schools and the violence and it's a lot more than just all firearms i promise you so you know
and not to get into that subject but real quickly every house in albina has a has a weapon we've
never had one mass shoot ever right but what we don't have is cypotropic drugs right most children
the minute they get a little depressed put them on this pill put them on that why are the american
people not demanding just toxicology every shooter we should draw blood i want to know what they were
on i guarantee you there's a common denominator yeah your answer is right in front of your face
every time you turn on the tv and there's like a commercial if you're taking such and such
discontinue the use of your experience in you know suicidal thought okay the answer is right there
clearly some of these drugs make people yeah but i mean like one of the one of the fundamental
things too that i see with people nowadays is might want to cut that word out not finding
not finding like there's no sense of purpose a lot of people especially older people like
people like in their fifties maybe even forties they they can't figure out a way to benefit
or bring any sort of value to society and that is the worst thing for a human being
having that feeling of no purpose and no bringing no value that is the most depressing thing most
people don't even want to know what they do what they want to do in their life even if it's just a
dream i'll sit there and talk to people and i talked to a lot of young people because i've shifted
more towards motivational speaking inspiring people you know with my work the comeback team
to inspire people to never give up no matter where you are i've had some of the most extraordinary
people come on my show people that are paralyzed on the neck down people who lost everything people
who have been through addiction and crawled their way out of it and have turned their lives around
above and beyond people that didn't have those problems so i agree with you i think one of the
biggest problems we have is that most people don't know what their purpose is or what their why is
and the sad part is instead of trying to figure that out and spend time on that they waste their
time and idle stupid activities i always say you'll never be a player if you're someone else's
fan i know that sounds a little weird but i'll explain that i can't tell you how many people
i know watch sports nothing wrong with it everything has a time and purpose but if all you're doing is
one sport to the next fantasy leagues gambling placing bets on the stuff you know every stat
you're reading tons and tons of newspapers and one way or the other unless you're 20 millions of
dollars gambling that's a whole different story yeah you know like unless you're like one of these
really good guys at it or girls right you wasted so much time and resources and money on something
that's never going to change your life if anything it costed you your life because by being a fan
you couldn't become a player how can i be a player in the game of life if all i do is spend my time
and my resources watching other people live in their dreams so that's why i say you'll never be a fan
i'm sorry you'll never be a player if you're someone else's fan yes you should admire people
that are successful but i mean like when you're really a fan all you do is sit there and watch and
study and the jersey and paint the face and you know that time could have been used better
mean your life or your children's life or it's the same thing as tiktok scrolling tiktok
scrolling instagram watching very addictive watching football i'm guilty of it it's mind
numb a little bit but i am a content creator and it does kind of serve a purpose a little bit for
work yeah when you can create stuff that's valuable to people yeah it's great but i mean like the
whole thing the whole platform is just fucking a waste of time people just like fucking china they
they have lockdowns on it after what a certain time frame where their kids can only see
educational content there making a volcano or something like you know a school project yeah
and these things are not by accident you know dumbing down of the american we need to like
really wake up we need to read we need to study we need to have purpose and if we don't know if
you're young and you're listening to this show and you're in your 20s already you should start
having an idea the secret to life is not making it it's knowing what you want once you know what
you want you gravitate towards it and things do fall into place and i don't care how far behind
you are wherever you are right now at this moment in your life there's someone that started further
away from the same dream you have and they already got it meaning someone in worse circumstance than
you was able to get to where you dream of going in and you have no excuse get up start today read
study i'm not saying school either man a straight a student i can't tell you school impacted my life
man a little bit there's no way to deny that it told me how to articulate and write right which
was i think the most important thing in school is learning how to write and communicate in basic
math definitely you know history i love but we also know that can be very flawed and very one
sided and maybe not paint the whole picture albania's i even mentioned no and right in albania we
learn about world war two all the time and albania was the only country in the holocaust
that saved every single jew that came to its borders really okay so much so that there's even
speculation that even possibly albert einstein we may have saved his life we're having a very hard
time proving it though um i i'm very good friends with the prince of albania prince lec amazing
human being whose family uh was in power before the fall to musolini when they invaded albania
because italy's right there so albania was under italian and german occupation during the holocaust
and we were the only country in europe with more jews after world war two than before and not a
single jew perished on our watch and my grandmother's brothers were hung by the ss by the nazis and
still not a single jew died in albania there's plenty of albanians that could have sold them out
and uh told them where they were hiding or what they were doing and never happened not on our
watch and i'm very proud of that story how come they don't make a movie about that when they talk
about our people but they'll show a movie taken which make us look like animals you know speaking
of movies have you i'm sure you've seen the movie war dogs of course that was a fascinating his well
actually i take that back it wasn't so much in the movie it was more so in the book the arms and the
dudes where they give a more thorough background on what happened in albania and it was fascinating
how albania was stuck with maybe you could talk to this better than i could but i don't remember what
what the exact reason was but for some reason albania got gifted like billions of dollars
worth of arms and ammunition from china and albanian communist albania but those weapons were
garbage bro garbage the ammunition was apparently fine so all of the eight they there was i forget
how much it was it ended up being like a like a couple hundred million dollars worth of a k ammo
that those dudes sold to the united states for the war in iraq and all of it according to the to the
military officers in iraq all of it fired perfectly there was never any issues with it but it was
chinese and for some reason sat there forever too it sat there for decades so that actually did
happen correct and it was in the book word looks it was in the book the books called the arms and
the dudes yeah the book is fascinating and the movie is just like a they they briefly talk about it
but i don't think they talk about all of the ammunition and all the arms that were gifted
to albania from china yeah and and charming communist albania they did have a relationship
with china but like i said my family us we were all anti-communist fighters that's why i was born
in america my great-grandfather was up in the mountains of albanian fighting against that regime
but they were outnumbered outgunned and the rest of my family got thrown into internment camps
my my mom's side of the family my great-grandfather did 28 years in a gulag type prison of which he
got out and lived a year after my great-grandmother was hung off a tree and that's you know why my
mom ended up in the u.s as a child my mom i think she came in when she was like seven or eight
so my mom speaks english better than me which is crazy and english was my first language it wasn't
albanian i learned albanian later in my life wow so i have like a weird new york my voice is very
deep too so it like kind of exaggerates the way i pronounce certain things it's not really a true
albanian accent you know do you think that sort of trauma in your bloodline transcend like do you
think that gets passed down somehow without without the actual knowledge and actual like
without the experience do you think that somehow gets transferred i think there's definitely such
a thing as generational trauma 100 i think that everything shapes you whether you realize it or
not so i'm a product of two traumas right so two negative things led to something positive right
negative times a negative equals a positive i consider my birth positive i consider my
contribution to life a good one i don't hate the people that did what they did i you know i think
there was a certain level of propaganda and things that happened i i hope that the people that neighbor
our people realize that like we just want peace too man like enough's enough already none of us
are winning man this whole war shit where has it gotten us right so i try to broadcast a positive
message i try to inspire people to be better and i think i find my bravery a lot of times you know
i'm not going to say that like i'm a big dude and i know a lot of people a lot of people new york
city is my playground i promise you when i tell you it's my playground it's my playground but i'm
not some tough guy trying to prove a point or or anything like that i think that you know i don't
know where i'm going with this thought because i just lost my first track of thinking but basically
i feel like i just want to do things that are positive and at times when life gets really
difficult and it does get difficult to sit here and say that my life doesn't get difficult at times
i'd be lying to we all have problems personal issues things like that i think of my grandfather
and what he went through and how he came to this country with nothing and started as a doorman
and then a super and like he went through hell and brought kids he couldn't even speak the language
and and the bronx it was a freaking war zone at that time the bronx was burning when my family
started in america and i try i find strength when i think of them like what they went through
i do find so i do believe it does impact you when you're aware of where you come from and who you are
to know that my great grandfather great great grandfather his statue stands all over albania
he was the general of a of the resistance of our people the legion of pris around you can google
it the legion of pris around my great great grandfather was literally the general that led
that resistance he died in battle so i find bravery in in that and you know bravery doesn't mean
there's an absence of fear some people are just stupidly brave right but the majority of people
that were brave they had fear to me when i you know to me the most brave people in our history
here in the us i'm gonna take off my hat to people like dr martin luther king he knew he's
gonna die bro malcom x he preached a message of hatred in the beginning and then he preached
one of unity and it cost him his life he knew he was gonna die that's bravery and that's evolving
and that's taking new information and saying you know what maybe i was wrong and i think that we
all can get along and it doesn't matter what the color and he changed his whole tone it cost him
his life and he knew he was gonna die to me you're gonna die anyway i'd rather die speak
into truth and live a lie and i'd rather die free than live i'd rather live one day free than a
million a slave and when i look at what my family went through and what it took them to get their
freedom now and i had a cousin that was you know in the war and i said would you fight again she
goes absolutely she goes these 20 years of freedom were worth everything the way we lived before
wasn't worth it so i think so many of us don't realize what we have and i hope that this message
you know i just want to be someone that brings people together i'm not trying to alienate serbians
or like like they're like we need to find a way to coexist enough's enough yeah just accept us
we accept you let some time go by come visit the places that you think are yours and you want
like no one's stopping you just acknowledge just the right to exist and we can all live in harmony
nobody's stopping you i get along with anyone i've met i've met serbians over here in america
that's the beauty of america man we here we can talk over there i can't be seen sitting down and
having a coffee with you and these are the things i loved about our society and our way of life that
even the worst enemies can come together and have a conversation in manhattan or in brooklyn at a
park yeah or over a slice of pizza and queens you know what i mean it just seems like there's
something missing in the dna chain of us that just makes us too tribal and just it's a there's
there's some sort of warring gene in us yeah but what about the human tribe you know with the human
tribe yeah but what's gonna what is gonna make us what would it take to make everyone on earth
see us as as human the human tribe what was going to take aliens landing on the white house lawn
an alien spaceship coming down and for all of us to unite together i mean i haven't i haven't
heard of a plausible scenario where that happens i just don't see i don't unfortunately don't think
there'll ever be true peace on earth i just don't see it happen ever all we can do is try to
broadcast this message of unity you know live and let live man live and let live as long as no one's
messing with your core you your children your way of life and you're leaving them alone why can't we
both coexist here matters of a bedroom or private matters whether you're one way or the other that's
just called decency respect for both do what you want to do in your bedroom man i don't give a shit
but you never think there will ever be peace on earth i think it's gonna get a lot worse actually
we'll see what happens what do you think's gonna happen i think the third world war is already
started and most of us don't even realize it what kind of war is that going to be it's different
see people play games like quality and it's not they think like i think it's already begun mentally
spiritually we're in the we're in the thick and thin of it right now most people don't even realize
that we're in it there's gonna be major shifts i don't know if our country comes out of this man
i really don't i think we're in serious serious trouble unless we wake up fast we don't make
nothing anymore brother we didn't have enough antibiotic when that i mean you're talking about
a superpower doesn't make anything anymore you're not a superpower anymore we're not a superpower
anymore i don't care that we have better weapons you don't think they have them too and we use all
those weapons and what's left on earth anyway for us but we are still superpower we're still
thought of as the superpower we were thought of but we're losing that pretty quickly like we need
to like step our game up we need to bring manufacturing but there's a lot of things that
need to be done and need to be done quickly we should never be at the mercy of another country
we should have never allowed certain countries into the world trade organization period you're
using labor that costs pennies those human beings don't even have a good life you're allowing labor
that's really slave labor is what it is how's the american worker gonna compete you did everything
and everything to not protect the interests of the american people to not protect the western way
of life and you've opened up pandora's box i heard somewhere that there's more slaves in the world
now than there were during jim crud if you're working for like five cents a day and you're really
getting i mean we're all you're a slave dude right going back to america and where it goes
you know it is interesting some of the the dynamic between america and some of these other countries
like saudi arabia for example like that's a weird one did you see recently there was a there was
that live golf league they were doing some sort of televised game of golf and trump was there
and they were interviewing trump in there i guess there was tons of protesters 9 11 protesters
victims of families of people who died in 9 11 were there protesting and they were asking donald trump
you know his opinion on all that he was like well we still don't know what happened in 9 11
we still don't we still haven't gotten to the bottom of what happened in 9 11 do you see that
interview no i did not that was fucking wild to hear him say that did we really get to the bottom
i don't think so i don't think so either
you know who knows what really happened that day bro are you skeptical about what i mean
so i've talked to a lot of people about this and it's very hard to say that as a new yorker
right that's that's what i've heard like people that that were closest you know one of my really
good friends she's like one of the most important people in building in new york and she she takes
the official account of what happened my whole thing is number seven bro but you know i would like
this episode to get out there so like we can talk about it it's okay it'll get out there don't worry
about it man i have still not been back to ground zero really i've driven past the area
i wanted to go on the 20th man i just i've never gone there i know i need to go there i haven't
gone maybe on the 25th anniversary i don't know but i still i still haven't gone back to the actual
you know i miss those damn buildings man i feel like i knew the world would never be the same
after those attacks that was the first thought that entered my mind that day when those buildings
came down it was like something horrible was coming after this and the world will never be the same
again and it wasn't and just just horrible man just everything that went down you know let's not
forget millions and millions of people lost their lives because it's not just the three some you know
close to four thousand we lost it's and more than that right all the people that breed the stuff
and after you're you're a victim of those attacks right right but millions of people across the
ocean that had nothing to do with it they had no saying if that happened or not or right and in
afghanistan they're back under control the people that supposedly helped do it and right and they're
better weapon now than it like so to me it's like it's a really sad feeling as someone that came out
from from those buildings that day in the aftermath and witnessing the war and i'm being alive this
long i turned 40 years old to know that it was kind of all for nothing
i had a family that served my cousin just enlisted in the navy yesterday
to get her citizenship you want to talk about like americans and like what it means like
she's from kosovo she is from kosovo she was living in colorado she wants to be an american
so bad she enlisted in the navy they just gave her assistantship she's celebrating she's so happy
willing to risk her life shout out to my cousin samira samira salio she enlisted in the navy
she's on a boat right now as we speak starting her first day as a navy woman wow but the key there
was to get her citizenship she's willing to put her life on the line to become an american
and you guys were born with this privilege and you don't take advantage of it you don't
care to stay up to speed and pay attention if we loved our country we'd all be watching
c-span every day instead of sports we would watch what these assholes are saying and then hold them
accountable when they lie we'd have massive protests demanding term limits because there
should be term limits brother and like i don't care if they can they want to go on forever no
problem as long as the people say you're doing a great job i'm not walking through human feces
i'm not living in a city where a guy can smash another guy over the head with a bat and he's
out in bail in less than two hours in new york city bro a place that was an example to the rest
of the world of what a society could look like where you were safe to go down the street where
everyone lived together in harmony and it was ripped to pieces in the last three to four years
it's horrible what they did to my city and i'll never forgive them for it ever you did a better
the blouse you did a better job at destroying new york than osama been fucking latin bro
mic drop wow so you think you can move to florida i can never fully disclaim new york it's my heart
it's my soul i i even if i come down here for my children to have a better opportunity and
in some ways i feel like someone leaving his homeland for a better start i can i have to go back
all the time my life is there i've invested too much into that to that town but yeah no new york is
hopefully we find our way back man it would be so sad to see that place never go back to what it
was it's just it's not i mean listen as far as like i'm involved in the nightlife there so
you know at one point my brother owned one of the largest nightclubs in new york closed down
about 10 years ago and i've been in the nightlife scene since 2000 so 23 years in in the scene man
and in the limelight as they call it and i've worked promoted i've done it all and i consult as some of
the biggest nightclub venues is there still a nightlife scene there is still a nightlife scene
it's very very different and you know it's very artificial brother and nightlife is pretty much
the same in new york as it is in vegas or miami and some of these companies are so big that
it's the same people calling the shots in all three cities right but you know for me nightlife
is more organic in europe is really like a real party really you know you gotta remember new york
cities rents are very expensive so you're not paying for a drink in york you're paying for the real
estate because these guys have crazy rents their rents are sixty a hundred two hundred thousand
dollars just open the doors that's without employees staff supplies that's just a rent
some people say like why is a month hundreds of thousands of dollars oh yeah better so why do you
think you know like why do you think a bottle costs 400 bucks you know yeah why do you think they
give minimums that you have to do because like i can't afford to let you in if you're gonna buy one
beer i have to pay my rent i have they're providing you with an environment that a lot of times they
have to also create they pay for women to show up there meaning like promoters go out and get
beautiful women to come hang out that costs money they gotta pay the promoter they gotta pay the
women they gotta give them free alcohol like you know you're literally building an environment
where someone that has the money can come and have fun so that's what you're paying for because it's
a lot that goes into the production you know you'll never see it's why they still hold the crown it's
why they were the epitome of all nightlife you know studio 54 the red rope the red rope that
that comes from them brother from steve lubell and uh ian schrager ian schrager is still around
he uh works with marriott he has the addition hotels are the ones that he designs
he did the one in new york the addition in uh i think it's what is it union square and then the
public hotel which is like a hot spot so this guy's influence is still felt and that all goes back to
that creative art that was the nightlife of new york from like the 60s from forever but really
kind of ended in like the late 2000s 2010 2015 it lost all of its arts artsiness very artificial
you know when i was first going out there was clubs like limelight and sound factory you'd
walk in on a friday and come out monday literally no joe much cocaine you need to do that i don't
know never did cocaine in my life was always scared of it always terrified of it you're not
missing much don't worry but if i liked it i'd be a dead man and many people i know died from it so
um but i drank enough i can tell you that i'm not even 99 of the people that are in night
clubs are doing cocaine especially down here especially in miami right not even miami i
fucking here in tampa st p i mean you know you're messing around with that stuff right now you're
literally playing roulette right now like people are dropping like flies from fentanyl brother it's
not worth the risk man it's really not like i always say don't take drugs like i'm telling you
as someone that's been in the nightlife the amount of people that have dropped like flies friends of
mine in la friends of mine in new york jersey really florida brother you have no idea what's
going into that shit if there's even this much of that stuff you're done you don't get a second
chance man unless someone narks you back to life that's another thing that's coming from
of course everyone's going well you know what i let them do the bumps first and then i'll watch
that's like they're don't be the first one doing the bag that's all i gotta tell you do not be the
first guy taking the first bump you're gonna be stupid you know mix it good yeah make sure that
you're not the first dude and the crazy thing is that's that's shit the cartels the cartels
are not mixing or from what i from what i've people that i've talked to the cartels aren't
mixing coke with well they want to the illusion your customer exactly making people scared to use
it it's really bad for business from what i've heard it's like the low level drug dealers here
it's not the guys that are just selling coke to their rich clients they would want to you
that makes no sense makes no sense to me kill your customer you moron what makes the sense is
it's the low level drug dealers who are also slinging heroin and pills and shit they're
they're mixing it all up together they're cutting on the same table and it accidentally is getting
cut but again i've heard that you know some people think it's more addictive to add it in there
but i don't i don't know maybe i just don't understand you know i'm not somebody that's
mixed a bunch of drugs together and fucking i'm not i take a fucking time on all p.m and i'm
fucked up for two days i could never take any like serious i do drink um kratom tea oh do you
so i don't drink alcohol i stopped drinking almost 10 years ago do you have a problem with it before
no no it's just that when my brother passed away i knew you know you learn listen nightlife
can either a be the most amazing thing that ever happened to you it opens doors you can't even
believe if you look at my instagram you see i'm friends with everybody bro i'm one or a person
away from anyone you can imagine it all came from the connections i made at a young age and then
continue to build throughout the nightlife when you meet somebody in the night their hair is down
as they say you get to see a form of their authentic self it might not be who they truly are but you
get to see who they are when their guards down right when they're just letting loose and having
fun and when you make that connection it was like hey i was vulnerable you might have seen me blow
a line or drink or do something stupid you didn't judge me for it i don't see you bad mouthing me
about it i kind of like you around me i'll see you again next time interesting there's a there's
like a bond there man but it's very dangerous because when you get sucked into the nightlife
a lot of people don't get back out man right or destroys their life where they have to just stop
it completely when i lost my brother i knew i couldn't drink anymore i knew from seeing people in the
past and when they experienced trauma to continue drinking was a death sentence i knew i would die
right i knew with what i was feeling in my heart where i was always just happy and there's videos
of me online dancing with glasses on my head and my trademark dance and you know i've been a part
of the the fabric of new york nightlife for over 23 years i knew that if i drink with that type of a
heart right heavy heart right i wouldn't make it out of it a lot i'd be dead and now i'm so used
to not drinking that i don't want to ever again so i i kind of like discovered the kava culture
shout out to kava sutra first place to open up in new york city but their flagship is in
florida i think lake lake lakeland or whatever it's called it's not too far from west palm beach
and um they provide a way to enjoy yourself socially without losing cognition
so it doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier and it's a very big subculture in florida yeah it is
florida is the mecca for there's a ton of there's a ton of crowded bars around here just right on
the street you gotta be careful crowd them too because too much of it can make you very nauseous
or get you to jitters but you know i have a tea very calming very chill you get a social component
but you never lose control of yourself one of the lessons i've learned is that you should never
i'm not advocating drinking or doing drugs but if you're gonna drink or do drugs you should only
do them when you're happy or you're in a good you're celebrating never when you're down or
depressed when you're sad don't drink it that's how that's a recipe for for death yes and that's
how you can jump off of a bridge or whatever like you know you need to really be in a good place
especially with alcohol alcohol can destroy you just as bad man you know i think alcohol is probably
the most dangerous drug that's legal right you know worse than other things in some ways because
you would do things you would not do on it and that cognition is important at times
just drunk driving how many people have died and you know it's insane it's it's crazy bro so it's like
you know i knew i couldn't drink so i stopped immediately and never had another drink ever
you were very close to your brother yeah it was actually my mom's brother but we were so close
in age that to say to people who's my uncle they would never understand the relationship right
this guy was my mentor he lived less than a mile away from me since the day i was born he was always
in my life we were either together all day or on the phone we were always we were inseparable
and when he passed away i mean it was just like he was the true king of new york
and i was like his little protege that's what he called me he's the one that gave me the name back
lover really my brother nicky knuckles got a rest his soul he owned an amazing night club
on 52nd street that's how i met the owners of the russian samovar he had a partner
and they opened that place together they had a good run there and but i was already a night
life before that but then once they opened it was like all right it's go time and i got to throw
some really cool parties there and my network expanded and i mean he's the reason i met half
the people i met and then i knew how to like capitalize on that you know how to network how
to that's interesting he brought me to a lot of like listen he brought me to places that no 18
year old would get in or experience and you know he showed me how to be social and how to talk and
how to create relationships with people and how to kind of you know how to just penetrate i mean
yeah i know i know exactly what you're saying man i have so many people i've met that are
fit the description that you're making right now and that fit that description of being able just
to connect with somebody instantly being able to find a way with words to make somebody drop
their guard or let their hair down and that skill i've never i've never seen that skill
in somebody like i see that in people that are born and raised in new york
especially like poverty in new york those people have a way of connecting with other
human beings like no one else i've ever met just just the communication skills alone
i think a lot of people who have been through trauma i know i myself because you know i'm
known somewhat of a little bit of a like a class clown growing up and a joke so i think a lot of
times when we're dealing with pain i do believe that that that slogan that they say the clown is
the saddest one in the room a lot of us are dealing with trauma and you know rather than
dwell on that and focus on that like let me laugh because i'm gonna fucking die today like i need to
laugh if i don't laugh i'm gonna lose my fucking mind like my life's already so so shit right now
at least let me fucking make people feel good and like so i feel like you know look at the robin
williams man yeah what else you want to know man right that guy's dead to this day still haunts me
i can't believe he you know the amount of joy this guy had the ability to make you laugh and
cry within seconds very powerful human being and for him to go down the way he went really just
broke my heart in so many ways and it scared me a little bit too because i feel like a lot of times
maybe i wasn't doing good and i was just using laughter as a way to self medicate since i don't
use alcohol i don't do drugs as a way to kind of like as i was like a high kind of like a way to
release endorphins right because it's nothing like laughing bro right like laughing is such a
powerful weapon if you use it the right way yeah it's an easy way to pick up a beautiful woman
yeah you know i know i know it works trust me it's a beautiful way to instantly connect with
someone like someone makes you laugh bro and they're like really witty and sharp in the way they do it
you feel an instant bond with that person right like and like this guy's not an asshole right
they're funny i kind of i'm gonna give this guy the benefit of the doubt i think laughter is such a
powerful weapon when you learn how to master it and use it but i do believe a lot of people that
are funny all the time really probably deep down inside we're going through a fucking hard time
yes yeah man for sure and we use laughter as a way to deal with the pain
and i know there was times in my life when my life was on fire right like you get a phone call
you find out 30 people you love are dead you know that was a phone call that was a phone call i mean
it's overseas right and so that was sophomore freshman or sophomore sophomore junior year high
school you know and you know i got a phone call when my brother died that shit was fucking crazy
you know i'm get to work and then i get a phone call from my aunt and she doesn't want to tell me
what's going on i already knew somebody was dead then my cousin calls me tells me i just i wasn't
a yellow cab man when i found out he passed he died in a car accident in 2013 and i'm in the back
of this cab because they had told me to like rush towards you know get to his house and i'm in the
back of the cab and when my cousin calls me my cousin leo he's like did you hear i'm like bro
just tell me who died man he's like nicky died bro and i just i fucking lost it bro i started
punching the roof going fucking crazy you know the poor cab man the guy you know i always say
my things like if you're seeing me i am sorry he pulls over he's like sir are you okay like are you
alright i said sir i'm sorry i said i just got some really bad news i said please just get me to the
ferry man i'm trying to get to the ferry to get to jersey you know where he lives and you know
you go through these things man and it's only a matter of time we all get hit in life i tell people
there's knockouts there's knock downs and knockouts a lot of people go through knock downs and act
like they should when there's a knockout a knockdown is you lose your job now you're like oh my god
what am i gonna do i lost my job and i know how stressful that can be i've been there before
you lose you know a girlfriend or a boyfriend or you know um something that's just really annoying
and and and and you know maybe so your divorce is pretty bad too i still don't consider that a knockout
you can always get married again you mind the marrying someone even better than you so it's
the way you think it's the way you perceive but a knockout is when you lose something you
can never get back man and when someone passes away man one year goes by two years go by ten
years go by and you're like man i'm never gonna fucking see him again in this dimension ever again
a song a dance a moment you know i tried to leave new york city when he died it became so
unbearable for this guy was larger than life bro nicky this guy would light up a fucking room
in seconds bro and everybody wants to know who this guy was and he'd buy everyone a drink
and he was the funniest fucking guy you ever meet in your life and i get so happy when people
compare me just a little bit to him they're like you you sound a little bit like him you look at
he had way better hair than me i took after my dad's side my mom's side that got good hair
and i did things with this guy that like if i tell people and you know what used to be like for me
it was like i would tell people like because i'm in high school he'd take me somewhere amazing
and i would come back i'm like i just met puff daddy you know yeah okay back everyone thought
i was full of shit like if social media existed when i was a teenager the shit i was doing i would
have been blown up i would have been bigger than the paul brothers like i was doing extraordinary
things and when i would tell my classmates 99% of them thought i was full of shit and now you guys
know i wasn't you know i wasn't i wasn't a lady killer in high school they thought i was a clown
you know but after high school when i entered the nightlife you know word got around telling
back lovers like all over new york like this guy's everywhere you know but like i said it was it was
him man like he opened so many doors for me introduced me like i met the most amazing
people because of this guy bro and like the stories like so so for me like when you go to
that type of trauma i was like my first instinct was like to run every corner of new york's memory
every single corner new york is not as big as you tourist think it is right it looks high that's
about it but it's not it's 16 square miles or whatever it is every corner was a freaking memory
man a song will come out it was like you're being haunted and like instant tears instant tears
everywhere i'm going i don't know how i got through those years man all i had was a little voice
inside and like you said earlier having a why my why was my boys i knew i couldn't give up because
of them but i understood for the first time why so many people give up bro when you experienced
that type of a loss someone that you loved so much even some people for divorce they give up
bro they take their lives or so much domestic violence happens when that happens it's not
worth it man you can get married again you will find love again i understand you feel like you've
been robbed of your time and you can't but like everything happens for a reason man and when there's
kids involved but not to get off the tangent you go through this trauma and you feel like you're
never gonna get out of it that's a knockout but you can't get out of it and you will get back up
and that's why i got back up and that's why i understood for the first time that's sorrow why
people take their own lives i finally felt that pain i also understood if i drank that that could
happen to me and that moment of weakness i'm drunk just take your own life man right so
that's why i started the comeback team the show that i did 85 episodes i need to do a second season
next guest is kevin hines golden gate bridge he jumped off survived oh shit really definitely
have him on your show too amazing amazing story how he survived now his story to me is that that's
why i believe there's a creator there's no way the way he survived what happened to him
he jumped off the bridge and then a sea line came and kept him afloat come on bro the what
like a seal kept him above water what come on bro you tell me that's by accident my cousin should
have been dead on the coast of a war people on 9 11 didn't go to work two seconds earlier they
survived they missed their train that's what's known as divine wisdom beyond your comprehension
when we look backwards sometimes we can understand it but not everything is for us to understand
right not everything that happens makes logic if you believe in a higher power if you don't it is
what is i don't knock people everyone you get to choose man i can do anything i want i can say
anything i want it's my choice people do what they do it doesn't mean that they're following a
certain doctrine the right way none of those religions permit murder killing innocence you
know like there's rules and people don't follow these will say how the hell are you a follower of
that faith you're not you're not you know we all make mistakes well back i can't thank you enough
