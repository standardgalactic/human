about six months before I went to college I met an older woman while I was
working in the supermarket and very attractive and like I was not quite 18
and she was about 32 we wound up having an affair I found out soon after that
she was married do she had two kids but I never met the husband the husband was
always gone so I was assuming he was a businessman or a doctor just were crazy
hours ultimately I find out later on that he is one of the bosses in the
Colombo family and his name is Greg Scarpa and they called him the Grim Reaper
he had the I mean he told me he stopped counting at 50 bodies and he's probably
got a hundred or 200 I mean it's probably one of the most feared mob guys in
history
