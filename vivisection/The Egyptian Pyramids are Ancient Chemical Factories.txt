The Egyptian pyramids are a series of chemical reactors that were designed to produce at
least a half dozen different chemicals in series.
It's a huge network of temples and pyramids that were all functional structures.
And I truly believe that the Egyptian pyramids and all of these ancient structures across
the planet were designed to work in conjunction with the forces of nature, powered by electric
fields coming from lightning.
And I believe that the terraforming applications transformed the desert into an agriculturally
rich farmland.
So I do believe that there was a massive civilization that lived involved with an extraction and
processing of different metals, using the chemicals for leach mining of metals and ammonium
bicarbonate for fertilizer production.
