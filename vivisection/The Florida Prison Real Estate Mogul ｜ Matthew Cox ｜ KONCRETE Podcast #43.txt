we're back round two of the Matthew Cox story saga series podcast series we had
such an overwhelming performance here scoot this a little bit closer so where
did we leave off on the first podcast I think we wrapped up arrested yeah you
got arrested at the very end of your career in mortgage fraud and identity
right you got busted from that stupid home invasion you went to trial right no
I didn't go to trial so what happened right after you got arrested what was the
process super guilty super guilty guilty you're super guilty don't even think
about going to try well I mean if you're innocent you go to trial you can be
innocent go to trial you still got probably a 50% chance of being found
guilty I mean so if you're guilty you just say hey look you just beg for
forgiveness and say hopefully how come you have that Mike and not one of these
because Shane typically sits here okay and this big arm like blocks his the
view of him okay so that's why you started using this one yeah basically I
got arrested you know and so I got taken to the Secret Service you know
headquarter in Nashville and then I was flown to Atlanta and all of my cases
were consolidated in Atlanta so I had cases in South Carolina in Florida in
Tennessee and in Atlanta and they were all consolidated in Atlanta and so you
know they gave me a I didn't have any money they took all the all the money I
had and how much money did you have at the time at the time you know the thing
is is that but the banks because someone were like credit lines with the bank as
soon as the banks were notified they immediately like clawed back any money
that was in their accounts and that sort of thing so how much money I have at the
time I don't know we were trying to get I couldn't even tell you man and we'd been
robbed we had a bunch of money stolen from us it was I don't know maybe it was
half a million dollars I couldn't even tell you I do know we were set up to get
another half a million or so possibly a million in refinances like I was in the
middle of setting all of that up to try and get that see we found out that
dateline was coming out and when dateline came out like I'd already been in
Fortune magazine had come out you had already done the dateline interview no
I hadn't oh so they came Rebecca Halk got caught before me so her lawyer had
gotten involved and she was from like the Johnny Cochran law firm or something I
really was right from the Johnny Cochran law firm and I actually I saw her on TV
the other day I forget her name so hmm she had gotten her an interview you know
she was on fortune in fortune magazine it was the whole you know I'm a victim I
fell in love with this guy he convinced me to do all these things he manipulated
me and I'm a victim and I didn't know what I was doing and it's all him and
he's a horrible person so this so they get they do an interview with fortune
magazine fortune magazine puts up the writes a story based on her perspective
it's actually and it's on the internet and so so that and then dateline she did
she did dateline and it was a whole poor poor me he's a bad guy I'm a nice
person you know he he's a Don Juan he manipulated me so you know which is
listen which honestly had she never come across my path had she never met me
granted that was probably true so by actually meeting me it definitely spun
her world yeah so that was her whole take so that had but so dateline was
about to come out so I was about to leave the the United States and that's
when I got caught so I I get caught I get brought I end up in Atlanta I'm in
Atlanta my I they took all my money I don't have any legitimate money so I
can't get a lawyer I end up getting a public defender so the public defender
comes in and she's basically like look they said they said you stole 26 million
dollars I'm like 26 million dollars that's insane never seen 26 million
dollars they're like yeah 26 million the FBI is talking about charging you with
40 million dollars and they they have money or they have like money laundering
and all these just the charges were just outrageous and there was tons of them
think at one point if you tack them up stacked them all it was like 250 years
or something then she said don't worry about that the most they could do is they
stacked them really some of those are doubled up and if you plead guilty most
you could get his 54 years but don't worry that's not gonna happen either I'm
like Jesus I mean it was just horrible wow you know I'm 37 years old and I was
just thinking I'm gonna I'm gonna die in prison and this is ridiculous I was
filling out paperwork filling out paperwork bring it to the bank they're
giving me checks I mean you you're talking about giving me something you give
a you know a serial killer so she ends up saying she's like look they want to
talk to you FBI wants to talk to you Secret Service wants to talk to you
they've already indicted you in these jurisdictions your co-defendants have
already cooperated against you a few of them not all of them some of them just
avoided talking to the FBI at all but most of them had already cooperated
Becky was already in jail a girl named Allison Arnold remember the girl that
went in the bank as Rosita Perez yeah okay she ended up getting she ended up
oh what does she do she ended up turning herself in going in and saying look
I'll plead guilty I'm gonna turn myself in and I'll plead guilty really and she
plead guilty and turned herself in and they gave her like 30 months for
turning herself in FBI had actually told her she won't do any time and then the
US Attorney came in and said this guy Robert Malzakowski came in and he said
no she's got to go to jail so that's the problem is the FBI will sometimes make
a they'll sometimes the FBI will come in and they'll make promises to you yeah
but they're not actually allowed to make promises so you're you're thinking the
FBI said that they were gonna do this but they can't they can't promise that
and so you're banking on the FBI doing what they said they can do but they're
not really in a position to make any promises right and then the US Attorney
steps in and says oh I never said that or the agent said that well the agent
doesn't have authority to say that well I didn't know that yeah that's not my
fault no no you're gonna get ten years what he said I'd get two years you know
you know and they always try and they always kind of do a little whole thing
look I'm gonna do this and this and you're honestly between you and me you're
probably gonna end up with a couple years that's it really yeah bam next thing
you know you get ten years so and they're always sorry oh yeah Allison told me
that the FBI agent actually Candace the woman that remember the woman that I
called mm-hmm she told me she actually after she was sentenced the girl you're
playing chicken with basically that the girl who's saying she she was like come
turn yourself in Tampa and you're like what about Atlanta right and you had the
track of the burner phone right so that agent actually went to Allison after
she was sentenced she had to turn herself in and went and told her look I'm so
sorry she said she she oh she was just like I'm so sorry she's like you said
I didn't have to go to jail right you said I didn't have to go to jail and she's
like I they just give me 30 months and she's like I'm so sorry I didn't realize
I really thought that that was what was gonna happen and you know okay so
also went to you know went to jail Allison really genuinely you know never
got really much money or anything like that she in 30 minutes it's ridiculous
wow so you know and she cooperated you know I talked to Allison every other day
really yeah I talked to her all the time I mean she's she's awesome she's an
amazing person and you know and it's so funny too because like when I watch the
American greed and she's like Matt Cox is the greediest person I've ever met I
called her up and I go you just said Matt and she's like I'm so sorry you
don't understand the pressure I was under was the producers they fed me that
line it was funny she's uh she's yeah she's super cool I talked to her all
time so anyway let's see so what happens is so there you met with your lawyer
said they're gonna get you down to like 53 years yeah yeah she's actually when
when she sat there and I said okay well what what kind of a deal am I can I get
and then she said well she's there they want you to sign what's called an open
plea and open plea means that you plead guilty and whatever the PSI come your
pre-sentence report comes out to you that's what it is and she is so I go
well what's that she's well they don't do that till after you've cooperated after
you've talked after you've you've completely done everything they've
asked and then they'll do that she's but we can figure it out ourselves she's
because I know what you're charged with I said okay so we go over it it ends up
being between 12 to 14 years I said okay cool 12 to 14 years she's 12 to 14
years plus you're going to get cooperation cooperation means that
they're going to reduce your sentence it's a it's a substantial assistance if
you provide substantial assistance with the government they'll reduce your
sentence and basically you're gonna snitch on somebody right and get
somebody you know get somebody jammed up and get them charged okay well
everybody I already know and I'm telling her everybody I know has already
cooperated she's like I know but you need to go in and talk to him anyway you
know plus they want you to be interviewed by Dateline and I went okay
they said cuz Dateline had already done a one-hour special on me and they said
but Dateline wants to do another one-hour special but they want to
interview you this time she was in the government wants you to do it and they
said they will consider it substantial assistance okay well then I've got to do
it because I don't have anybody I can tell on could you get it in writing or
anything no they're not gonna put anything in writing really that I mean
that almost never happens I actually know of one case the whole time I've been
locked up I know of one case of a guy that got a guarantee we will reduce your
sentence okay so so I go in I talked to the talk to the FBI for three days
two days or three days I was too about about two three days and so I explained
this is what happened this is what I did this is what I did here I did this
I did this here who helped you so and so help me they're like okay well we talked
to so and so remember they came in first they gave me a stack of what's called
302s which is other people that cooperated against you right and they're
called they're the it's interviews with witnesses they're called 302s give me a
stack of them and I'm literally every single person I know they've well not
everybody but almost everybody they've talked to already I'm like Jesus Christ
all these participants of our co-conspirators have already cooperated
so I say you know they're like oh with so and so said this I'm like yeah that's
true that's what happened but I don't really have any new information they'd
had three years to investigate right so I don't have anything okay and people have
been indicted but they hadn't arrested anybody you know they were waiting to
catch me well keep in mind by the time this is all taking place the economy is
melting down this is 2007 so by late by mid to late 2007 the economy is
starting to melt down it's the more it's it's the beginning of the mortgage
crisis right so thanks to you yeah exactly my little few million dollars
yeah melt in and you know that's the kind of stuff they were saying though
because of people like you I'm like serious talking about billions of
dollars right they're so ignorant you know they need a face exactly so so
anyway I end up going in and I talked to the Secret Service and my I always loved
it when I went talk to Secret Service I told you that I used to make banks right
I would make like fake online banks so if I had to verify some but I say I have
to verify you let's say you need something like reserves okay so I have a
bunch of mortgages and I'm refinancing them but you have so many mortgages the
bank says look we need to know that if you lose your job you can make all these
payments we need to know you have six months worth of reserves yeah well I've
got five pain five payments on five different mortgages already so they go
so we need to basically need to see that you have $60,000 in your bank why
did have a bank with $60,000 so what I did was I would make online banks and then
I would create a website for them the clone another website change a few
change it around a little bit make a basic go-daddy type very simple website
and so they get and then I'd make fake bank statements and I would send them
to the banks and then they could check they could always go to check out the
bank so I made one call the Bank of Ebor one was a bank of it was a Southern
Exchange Bank of Clarksville because the bet that bank had actually been sold to
country I'd sold to like First Union or somebody anyway so these were banks that
were already like known banks no these aren't real banks there's no bank of
Ebor so so but if you've got you're some you're just some underwriter and all
they're doing is they're getting some bank statements and if they're
questioning it they go they can always look up the website where they can call
and there's a there's a voicemail talking about how it's a small local bank
we're currently you know experiencing how high-collar volume leave your name
and number someone will call you back whatever so you know which almost never
happens because they have the bank statements they have original bank
statements so and then you know and they're verifying everything they're
making calls and they're probably not going they're really just verifying the
reserves and they have the bank statements that's all they need so the point is
is that when I get caught by the Secret Service one of the first things that they
say to me is look we want to talk to you about what happened you know we've
already talked to Rebecca Halk and so here's the issue Mr. Cox is are you
hiding any money have you given us all the money I said absolutely you got all
the money out of SunTrust you got all the money out of First Tennessee Bank you
got all that I start naming you got all those you I gave you all the banks they're
like Mr. Cox we know you're hiding money no no no I'm not hiding any money they
go yeah yeah you are they said you're you're about to get charged with
obstruction of justice and I'm like my lawyers going hey do we need to talk
I'm like no I gave them all them what are you talking about they pull out a
couple of bank statements and slam them on they go you've got a hundred and
eighty thousand dollars in Southern Exchange Bank of Clarksville under the
name of Walter Holcomb and I'm like like are you serious and they're like yeah
and what are you doing and I go whoa I said listen oh my god keep in mind you
got the US Attorney there and two Secret Service agents and I go did you call
the bank they go yeah we called the bank I went did you talk to somebody and
they go no we left I've left several messages I go did you go to the website
they go yeah I said what did you think of it and he goes and it's a website the
bank website what do you mean I go but I mean it's well done it's professional
because I mean it's a bank website now it yeah but it's it's convincing and he
goes oh son of a bitch he goes it's fake isn't it and I went I said bro it's all
an illusion oh are you serious I go who did you you what did you do he is we
subpoenaed the bank I go what bank there's no bank and he said they looked
it up on the bank registry and the number was actually good because there
was a standard Southern Exchange Bank but it wasn't Southern Exchange Bank of
Clarksville mmm it was a real Southern Exchange Bank that had been purchased by
another bank so the registration number or whatever was still good so they had
the address and they subpoenaed them a few days earlier I was like this is
insane I said I haven't paid that thing in months there's no way he turned around
he dialed the number and sure enough like the number goes doo doo doo you know
the phone yeah yeah and he's like and I'm like holy shit so I mean I always
thought that was funny I and I remember looking at the guy was just looking at
me smiling I go I'm embarrassed you caught me and he just starts laughing he
was actually cool the Secret Service was actually agents were cool you know I
went through everything this is what I did here this is what I did here they
kept saying look there's got to be other month more money out there it's like at
the end of American greed they say there's like four million dollars or
something yeah yeah this thing or some bullshit and they kept saying that kind
of stuff but there's no money okay so then when I met with the FBI they were
just it was Candice and she hated my guts oh you met with her in person yeah
yeah and the worst thing is tell you sweetie oh listen the worst thing about
Candice was she's got to be five nine five eight five nine and she wears heels
so she's like six foot tall mm-hmm and I've got slippers on from the jail and
I'm like five foot six five seven with a good pair shoes and I didn't have them
yeah and she towered over me and she was belligerent and she was just she
really loved the fact I remember at one point she was taking my handcuffs off and
and I rubbed my wrist and she said and she goes your wrist hurt and I go yeah
and she goes get used to it I was just like damn oh she really despised me so
anyway the point is is that I end up doing the interview with Dateline mm-hmm
because I think they're gonna reduce my sentence for it okay just keep in mind
I've everything I've told them they basically already know there's no
reduction in there that for me right so I do the dateline thing and the night
before my sentencing oh I got my PSI back by the way and it says like I'm
doing like 26 years you're 26 years in four months I never say the four months
because PSI your pre-sentence report okay so it's recommending that the judge
give me 26 years my lawyer's like don't worry about that we're gonna argue some
of these enhancements not a big deal so I go so she just plus you you're gonna
get a reduction okay well the night before the US Attorney decides she's
not gonna give me a reduction she's yeah and he she's but he did dateline he
was yeah well you said you'd consider it substantial assistant she's I did say
that and I did consider it and it's not Wow yeah I was like but she said she
would she doesn't she she said she would consider it substantial and she did
consider it and I was like oh my god the dateline interview how they absolutely
nothing for me at that time so I get in front of the judge and my lawyer argues
the enhancements and the judge is like yeah I disagree okay well this
enhancement I disagree keep in mind they do stuff like some of the enhancements
they were just ridiculous I mean I got you get an enhancement for committing
another crime while you're on probation so you get an enhancement you get a I
got an enhancement for more than like 50 victims or something but they counted
they counted a countrywide bank like five times and I was like no they just
turned right bank you took money from them countrywide financial countrywide
home loans country so it's like what do you touch so everyone there everyone
there's a separate entity okay well and my lawyer's like yeah they can do that and
then they turn around and they say okay well we're hitting you for taking
ceiling more than a million dollars from one institution and I was like what
institution is that they go countrywide you said it's five different no no no
for this purpose it's one you see I'm saying everything stacked against you
Jesus there's just nothing you can do you're at their mercy so anyway she loses
all these enhancements arguments for the enhancements judge says you get in 26
years in six months okay I'm sorry 26 years four months so I would say 26
years so I get 26 years I go back to the unit I mean bro bad day crying listen
crying like a small child I mean you can't believe the way I was I mean just
couldn't be I mean just the tears think even closing my eyes I mean they just
wouldn't stop coming we talked about just just fundamentally just fractured I
mean I was just it was like it was something you just can't believe that
you just got 26 years I couldn't believe I'd done anything to get 26 years I
filled out paperwork and given it to the bank and what what happened how is this
possible yeah so you know I ended up getting shipped to prison I go to prison
I go to the medium because I have so much time medium security medium security
prison which is it looks like a real prison it's what you think a prison is
there's two-tier systems so where it's a you know there's the second railing
there's there's a there's a a center console area where the guard sits and
you can see all the all the rooms down here they're locked down at night there's
a second tier up top where there's rooms I mean it's it's a real prison right so
I go there I mean it's just the guys there are all massively huge and I go
into the prison and as soon as I get there they assign me a room I meet my
bunkie which is this Mexican guy now as medium is a medium to your prison is that
for violent crimes okay yeah okay well it's a medium typically to go to a
medium up you have to have an extensive amount of time a long record or you have
to have violence okay you know for instance you know like if you have it
you could be something like you've been arrested four or five times gone to jail
once but you happen to have a gun in your case and they'll say that's violent
you had a gun that's violent you're going to the medium so you have high points
high security points my security points were like two or three which is which is
low that's a camp I should have gone to a camp what did you get any kind of violent
points for I didn't oh you didn't have too much time oh because it was so okay you
can't so if you have over 20 years to do you're going to a medium right I had 23
years as soon as you I got sentenced for 26 years they immediately knock off three
for your good time so I still have 23 years I've been locked up for a year
already so I got about 22 23 years left okay so you got to go I got to go to a
medium so I go to the medium right everybody there's almost everybody there
has like bullet holes in them they've all I met I met I've met 30 or 40 guys
that had actually gone to trial like for murder or already done state time for
murder or for something I mean there's there these are violent guys these are
guys doing home invasions these are guys doing car jackings these are big
time drug dealers and you don't even have to be a big time drug dealer you
can have just a cell be selling you know $10 crack rocks and you happen to have a
gun you're going to a medium or a pen so I end up going to the medium I remember
the first time I get there I meet my celly we shake hands I go down I was the
first guy you met first guy met and it's locked down all the time so I actually
I went down to get like some water or something suddenly immediately they
start screaming lockdown lockdown lockdown and I don't know what I'm like
what's going on my celly comes up to me and he says hey cell you gotta go we
gotta get a room now and I was like he's a come on come on you know he knows I
don't know anything I'm like well what's going on is we got to go the room and I
go okay so I go up to I said what happened he said somebody got stabbed in
the yard and I went someone got stuck someone died and he goes no no they just
stabbed them a little bit just stabbed up stabbed up a little bit I was like a
little bit so yeah I mean that's just the kind of place it was you know and it
wasn't there wasn't like a lot of gang activity if there was it didn't have
anything to do with me and the reason that I got lucky was within a few
within a month or two I'm basically hanging out in the library because people
are stabbing each other in the yard so I end up they have what they call
continuing education courses yeah not continuing education sorry they're
they're ace courses adult continuing education courses okay so there was a
guy who taught the real estate class he ended up after a month or so didn't want
to teach it and he comes to me and he goes listen man I don't want to do this
anymore I'm doing legal work all the time it's just too much can you start
teaching it I said sure so I start teaching the real estate course wow
that's ironic yeah I know the real estate course the whole time I was at
Coleman from the meat as soon as I left the medium within a month I'm teaching
it at the at the low but anyway I stayed at the medium so I'm hanging out the
medium and I'm waiting and I'm thinking to myself that I I'm I'm really kind of
just screwed there's nothing I can do so after I end up getting a job in
education and I'm teaching a real estate and that's all I do what was that like
how many people were in your class how many how many in the real estate thing
yeah oh like 40 guys 40 guys listen and you know and you've got some guys that
show up and they show up and they're like listen man I just want a certificate
because my case managers bugging me and telling me I gotta take classes I don't
want to be here and I'm like okay so go to sleep yeah no well no I was like look
just give me two coffees you know they sell bags give me two bags of coffee and
two bags of creamer okay and I'll fill out all the paperwork and I'll make sure
you get the certificate and they're like man cool great they take on they bring
it back and they will they will bring it back like at the low guys will try and
fucking fuck you over mm-hmm but at the medium that guy the next week shows up
here's your stuff man because because things can go wrong in the medium they
have a lot more respect for one another okay so you know it's funny you would
think at the higher levels yeah you'd have less respect but the higher levels
guys are more respectful for one another because the consequences are so bad
right at the low they're jerks to each other because you're at a low and you
want to stay there so you're not gonna stab someone at a low although it
happens yeah because you want to stay there people are a lot more ruthless
yeah so right and pens and that sort of thing so anyway I end up leaving so three
years sorry how often were the classes how like how many a week it's like one
or two a week okay at one point I was teaching teaching two classes and what
kind of stuff are you teaching them I teach just basic real estate like how
to buy houses yeah okay I mean I get loans yeah how to get how to get a loan
how to get a hard money loan okay what they should be paying what they charge
what the you know how to write up a what the hard money lender is gonna be
looking for how to determine is this house you know worth buying you know you
know you go through the whole thing pulling permits whether or not you know
you should pull a permit or not I mean technically you change a toilet you're
supposed to pull a permit yeah nobody does that so you kind of just go through
the motions with them right you know and I explained to it how it always sounds
good yeah I bought this house for 40,000 I put 20 in it I sold it for 80 you know
and people like you know oh man you made $20,000 it's like no no I didn't you
don't you know it sounds good it's always you know you things go wrong this
got stolen that got stolen it's a pain in the ass I had to clean up glass in
the front yard I you know it's always I always think you're gonna make 30,000 you
make 25 and if you think you're gonna make 30,000 and you end up making 25 you
feel like you got screwed out of $5,000 I mean it's it's just it's all it's like
being a professional construction worker and it's just it's tough it's a tough
business yeah so but I go through it all and they all think they're gonna get
out flip houses and they get psyched up and get pumped up and yeah and it was so
funny too because you've been running your own YouTube show out of there and
live-streaming it you would have had a millions of followers it was great too
because it was like it was so amazing because they would walk up to me after
class and be like hey man that was good class and shake my hand really yeah it
was like and I was like you'd I'd have five or six guys every class shake in my
hand I'd be like this I wanted to look around I'm not being pumped this guy
shaking my hand this guy's got 30 years he's a crack dealer and he's shaking my
hand and you guys are telling me that you know man I'm gonna do this when I get
out you probably really helped him you probably gave him you know I mean gave
him some sort of hope you know the thing being a drug dealer is probably is a
real asset in that because oh hell yeah because there are hustlers it is it's
hustling right and they don't mind going up and talking to people are knocking on
doors and arguing with contractors and stuff exactly so it's it's one of the
few things and I tell them all that and they would get excited yeah I'd go
through all the process so it was a good class everybody loved that class so it's
cool I had a waiting list so but I did that and then eventually I ended up
getting moved to the low mm-hmm so now I'm getting I'm moving how how long did
that take three years three years three years oh man it was just the worst so
that the medium was just something was this I although what was great about it
was I did have a my own I had a sale with a good a selly he was a good selly
he was an ex-gang member he'd already done 13 years Mexican guy Mexican guy 13
years for manslaughter mm-hmm or attempted murder sorry the time in Texas and
then as soon as he got out he thought he was going home they picked him up for
reentry and the feds hit him for something like seven or eight years he
got sent I mean just he could not get a break but he was he was a good guy so
let me think so anyway I go to the low I get to the low it's getting to the point
where I realize you know you know you know what what gets you through it is you
know hope right you know everybody's like I can I remember I always tell
everybody's always like I have a buddy named Shreya and Shreya's like man I can't
I couldn't do it I was like it's funny because when I first got arrested I had
met a guy and I met the guy and he this guy who'd been locked up in the state was
now doing some about to go and do some federal time for a gun and he'd been
locked up for like 10 years in the state and he'd done some time maybe just going
to the feds so remember he said or was it the opposite anyway so I remember I
said man I just it had only been a month or two I've been in county jail I was
like I can't do this I can't do this he goes well this is a great thing you
don't have to I go what do you mean and he goes you don't have to do it he was
they're gonna make you do it so it's effortless on your part you just have
to keep yourself entertained and I was just like that's horrible it's a horrible
thing to say but you come look at it but it's the only you know you start to
get to the realization where you you're gonna do the time there's nothing
there's just nothing you can do so really it's just about entertaining
yourself so so what happens is you know the other thing he told me which I
was always was interesting he told me and you're gonna not gonna believe this
but you're gonna meet some of the best people you've ever met in federal
prison I was like that's never gonna happen because I mean I'm sitting there
like these guys are scumbags you know there's that's not gonna happen he's
you will meet some of the best people you've ever met in federal prison you'll
build some great relationships and good friend lifelong friends in federal prison
he's in there will be moments he said when you will be hanging out with a
bunch of guys laughing your ass off he said and you will look up and you will
think these are great guys there's no place I'd rather be this is a these are
this is a great moment and I thought that's never gonna happen bro like three
four years later I was playing risk with a bunch of guys we've been playing for
two days and there's like four of us and we're screaming and yelling at each
other and laughing our asses off and double crossing each other and we're
drinking sodas and we got like the soda guys bringing us cold sodas and we're
eating popcorn and we're on the yard and it's we're laughing I mean just to the
point where your stomach hurts so bad you're just you're in tears and you're
cracking up and I remember looking up and thinking this is a amazing yeah great
I'm this is a great time these are great guys wow and I remember thinking it's
exactly what that guy and I had several moments like that Wow couldn't laugh
where you wake up the next morning your stomach hurts you're laughing you know
you've been laughing that much so I end up going to I go to low I'm teaching the
real estate class I I end up wanting to write a memoir right about what because
I'd been contacted by so you're still teaching the class in the low right okay
well actually what happened was just prior to that I'd been contacted by
American greed they wrote me a letter saying they wanted to interview me and
I called my lawyer and I said hey last is when I was still in the medium I forgot
this I called my lawyer and I said hey I got a letter she's I got the letter to
US attorney got the letter to she Gail McKenzie she's already called me she
wants you to do the interview hmm I said okay well wait a second last time I did
an interview she's no no she said she she's Matt she sent me an email I said
was it a guarantee she was what you know they won't do that but she said she will
she will consider substantial assistance and put it with the other one and she
believes that it's enough to give you you know to give you a reduction okay and I
said okay great can't hurt right right I what choice do I have you know right so
I do the interview yourself right I do the interview I they won't let the
cameras in because it's a prison in federal prison doesn't really let cameras
in most of these times you see these guys on they're usually state or if they
is federal they're still in the Marshall's custody because I was interviewed
by Dateline and I am on camera however I was in the Marshall's custody so once
you're in BOP custody not letting the cameras in so anyway I end up going to
warden's office and talking on the phone for like two days or something to you
know for several hours to American greed and they barely use any of it so they
run the they end up running the the the they end up running the whole episode
whole episode I know I only I saw it once I got out everybody had seen it
like guys coming up to me they'd seen I kept missing it I never did get to see
it till I got out is there anywhere online where people listening can find
that um no I mean I sent you the link remember can you make that link
clickable from your website the problem the reason I can't is because when they
gave it to me they said like they said first they wanted me to pay 350 and I
$350 and I said no no no I said I was and I explained you wanted to watch it
right I just want to watch it right so they gave it to they gave me a thing and
they said but it's not available it's for you to watch you not you can't share
it you know it's not to be licensed it's not to be made publicly available and to
be honest I don't want to get sued you know you've seen it it used to be on
Hulu when I first got out I watched it on Hulu so so anyway so I end up doing the
American greed yeah and they air it and my lawyer contacts us turning says look
at aired date line and this and she says okay and she goes well well we need you
to reduce in his sentence and right she says well you know the promise I'm just
not sure let me think about it so she drags her feet drags her and finally she
comes back and she says listen it's just not enough I mean there's no rest I
don't know what to do let's use we don't know what to do I mean I feel for Mr.
Cox but that's just the way it is so about the same time this is happening a
guy named Jim Montram contacts me and he owned the loaner national loan
origination school and all mortgage brokers have to take like 12 hours or
nine hours of continuing education and like three hours of that is ethics and
fraud and he came to me and he said look I want you to write an ethics and fraud
course with me so I can teach it during the first continuing education want to
do a whole course I said okay well I mean that's great I call my call my
attorney she calls us attorney US attorney says I want to talk to this guy
he flies in they all get together they meet at the US attorney's office they
all have a conversation she says look definitely I'm going to do something he
definitely has to do this this is huge I can definitely make an argument that he
deserves a sentence reduced if he does this so I write nine nine nine ninety
five hundred word course I write the whole course I do everything he starts
teaching it we go to apply to them to ask them okay can you follow our sentence
reduction and she says yeah it's just not enough so at that point I by that
point I got I had been moved to the low what's the point of getting you to do
all this stuff if she it seems like she wants you to do this well why does she
want you to do it she's continually being interviewed you know she's like a
media hound you know she likes them because she's being she's being
interviewed okay she's definitely being interviewed and it makes her look like a
big shot and she's the one who's always like mr. cock stole millions and
millions and millions and she was always like really jacking it up like it was
huge like it was it was like okay you're making things worse than they are and
it's untrue so you know a lot of the stuff was untrue that she's pumping up
and she knows it so anyway the point is is that I am now I'm just doomed I'm just
fucked you're doing I'm doing the time and so I'm kicked back and I'm doing the
time and I'm thinking to myself and everybody always I remember a tree on
my buddy says man you got 26 years how man how are you gonna do that are you
gonna have to do what 23 I said yeah I was gonna use your outdate was 2030 I
went well never thought I was gonna go to 2030 I was thought at 10 years they'll
move me to a camp and I'll just leave there's no there's no fences I'd have
10 years to go you move me to a camp at 10 with 10 years I'm not fucking staying
what is a camp a camp is you have a you have pens we have 80x which is in
Colorado where they put people under the ground and it's a it's for terrorists
and stuff then you have the most that's where El Chapo is that yes so and like
the shoe bomber and all these terrorists and stuff that's where they a lot of them
end up so you've got 80x then you have pens like Coleman has two pen
attenturies then you have mediums the bulk of the system I think is basically
mediums because that's basically what you think of is like a real prison yeah
and then you have lows and then you have camps camps have no fences typically
there's a few that have fences but even those fences you can jump on basically
you'll have like 200 people there 150 guys you'll have like two guards and they
sit in a room because you're basically on out custody is that where you can
do work release programs right you could write that sort of thing okay so
there's just you know can the camps and the camps are just outrageous I mean
guys are like jumping the fence going to getting McDonald's coming back guys are
jumping the fence going and robbing 7-elevens and coming back I mean there
was an Atlanta these guys are like they're they're all drunk all the time
there you know it's insane they all have cell phones they're all taken pills and
it's outrageous but they were saying look you know you'll I always assumed at
10 years I could have gone to a camp because I came in with camp points so I
was thinking to myself I'll go to a camp and I'll leave so basically by the time
I kind of started putting that together you know I've been locked up I had like
10 years to go in my mind I was like you got 10 years your role really had like
20 something years to go but I was just thought man I'll just go to a camp and
leave because I mean that's just you're trying to say anything to get yourself
through it yeah exactly you know it's that whole hope so little light at the
right anyway I go to low I'm there and I decide I'm gonna write a memoir so I
end up writing a memoir and while I wrote that memoir I read a bunch of books
on a bunch I really like two books on how to write memoirs I wrote read a book on
I read like a like nonfiction writing for dummies or something which is
actually a great book so I read these books and what's funny is it you know
you really have to kind of learn about yourself you know does that make sense
like you I got locked up and initially when I got locked up it was everybody
else's fault and you start reading about yourself and about memoirs and about
how to what helped shape you who you were how did you get here you know you
have to do some internal you know thinking about yourself you start to
realize you know I realized kind of like you know I put me here nobody else did
I made all those decisions I'm just a douchebag right I fucked up I've made
some selfish decision I'm extremely narcissistic I'm extremely self-centered
yeah I tend to dominate conversations it's difficult for me to take interest
in other people I mean I have some major fucking problems you know I'm
extremely entertaining well it's I mean it's huge to be able to recognize that
I mean that's a huge that's a huge I mean but what's yeah but I'm saying
that's what's funny is I'm in prison reading this and I'm like and you're
realizing yeah I'm going that's me where I would have never said that before had
someone actually accused me of being a narcissist or arrogant or anything I'd
be like that's bullshit you don't know me you don't know you know what you do
know me because you start to see yourself and you as you really are and so it
you know it's it's it's humbling you know to realize that yeah and then start
to see it in other people you know and see yourself in other people so you know
anyway I ended up writing a memoir while I'm writing that memoir guy named
Ephraim Deverelli is comes on the compound Deverelli is Deverelli was in
Rolling Stone magazine Deverelli had he and another guy named Packhouse had
sold military weapons and ammunition to the US government and he'd ended up
selling a bunch of Chinese ammunition which was embargoed and he got in
trouble Rolling Stone did a big spread on him by a guy named Guy Lawson so I
meet I read the article and somebody told me hey you know that article the
other day in Rolling Stone about the gun kid I was like yeah they go that's him
right there I was like fuck so later on I went up to him and talked to him and
said hey man my name's Matt Cox you know you ought to think about right I read
your that article on you you ought to think about writing a memoir and he was
like oh I couldn't write a memoir I'm like ADHD and I'm bipolar he said I
couldn't pay attention I couldn't do that I mean he was real dismissive I said
well if you need any help I'd be willing to willing to write an outline for you
or work with you on an outline you could probably send it to a ghostwriter on
the street and they could go stride it for you you still have plenty of money
obviously and he's like yeah I'll think about it so anyway a few like months go
by and eventually after several months I had basically was finishing up mine I
ended up getting a literary agent and so I convinced so Deverelli comes to me and
he says hey I'm you know I definitely I want to do it that sort of thing so we
end up doing this right I end up writing this book for him and so then he ends up
I'm not gonna get all into it it's too convoluted but another story it's a
whole nother story he ends up leaving with the memoir gives me a big bear hug
tells me I know more than anybody in the world completed for him of course right
I wrote the whole thing right I don't want to take you to write it about three
months okay which is quit really really quick but God he had a ton of it he had
all of his evidence and his sister was doing all research for me so if I was
like hey listen he told me about this or I'm sorry I'd send her an email say he
told me about one time this happened at this do you remember when this plane
blew up and can you look up some articles bam she sent me all these
articles yeah was that again his sister his sister was doing research for me and
he had like just put you in contact with all these people that he worked with in
his right and he had like ten or he had like ten or ten different boxes of
evidence oh wow under his bed and the lockers and everything so if I said hey
in there with him yeah wow well he's fighting his case okay so you know if I
said hey do you have your transcripts from that of course I'll bring them to
you tomorrow he'd show up with stacks of transcripts I had to read and pull out
stuff and so I end up writing this book he leaves with the book Warner Brothers
according to his his lawsuit Warner Brothers ends up getting a hold of the
manuscript okay and they use his manuscript and this guy Gee Lawson the
article that that in Rolling Stone magazine they bought the rights to the
article and they use the article plus hit the book that I wrote the manuscript
to supposedly write the movie War Dogs directed by Todd Phillips right and with
Jonah Hill plays Deverelli right and it's funny because you know anyway you know
he's a scoundrel he plays a scoundrel you really never I mean you know Jonah
Hill did a great job so that that movie gets made and then is it really is it
pretty accurate it's it's accurate only I think that I think Deverelli is is more
cunning more vicious okay you know so how how how on point is the movie to like
the manuscript you wrote did they go did they veer off yeah they definitely veered
off okay what they did was they they took scenes that were definitely scenes
from my manuscript but they swapped characters like they changed them they
altered them certain ways things that were certainly not in any of the other
books they're definitely taken from my manuscript but then instead of having
Deverelli like in the movie Paco's his girlfriend is against the war and there's
all these arguments between Paco's and his girlfriend about the war she doesn't
like the war she didn't like him selling weapons so she's against it in real
life that was Deverelli they just swapped the characters oh so Paco's didn't have
this great apartment it was that was Deverelli there's all these things that
they just swapped them because they couldn't because they had Paco's life
rights not Deverelli's so they just swapped the two wow but anyway so so what
were you doing when you found out this movie came out oh I'm in the I'm still
in prison Deverelli stopped talking to me my literary agent stopped talking to me
so what the two of them are now suing war we're then suing Warner Brothers who
Deverelli and my literary agent they end up teaming up and suing Warner
Brothers and nobody's talking to me nobody's telling me anything I've never
gotten that they're not sending me money they're not answering calls I'm
writing letters I mean that like I said that's a whole other story the point is
is they I I sue them they sue me they sue Warner Warner they end up there's all
these things I don't I've signed a confidentiality agreements I don't want
to say what what actually I know happened but the bottom line is this story on
your website the memoir is not on your website no okay no no no actually the
memoir is on the website I think you can buy the memoir if you click if you go
there part of the story is yes the story about me meeting him and writing the
book okay okay and then him getting out and him filing suit against Warner
Brothers and the whole that that part is there but then it kind of it I think I
end it with me filing a lawsuit and then I don't say anything else because since
then things have happened we've had mediations we've had several things so
it's that's currently going on currently going on right now so I told you about
where's some of the stuff that's happened where's Devaroli right now oh he's in
Miami I saw him I saw him a month or so about a month or so ago I went down for
deposition and that's a whole that's a whole nother story man that's it's
insane so I matter of fact my lawyer might actually be like what the hell are
you doing don't talk about that so but I don't think I've said anything it's not
already in public record but there's other stuff anyway so we're still oops
sorry we're still going back and forth anyway so I write his one you know I'm
writing now so now I've decided I want to write I remember Devaroli had read my
manuscript my my memoir and he said it was a he wanted me to write the story
he was that's the best thing I've ever best thing I've ever read but in
retrospect after later I found out he'd actually only read like excuse I never
really read anything so I was like okay well it's not really a compliment at that
you've read like three books your whole life so anyway so I write his story then
I end up writing Marcus shrinker story okay which shrinkers a guy that jumped
out of an airplane he in 2008 the fight it during the financial crisis shrinker
had ripped off a bunch of people and the they were coming to arrest him and he
knew that he was about to be indicted and arrested so he takes his airplane up
and he calls in a distress signal saying the windshields imploded I mean I'm
you know I'm bleeding I'm bleeding and he sets the autopilot and opens up the
passenger door and jumps out so he thinks the plane's gonna go out over the
fake his own death it's gonna go out of the golf crash in the golf even if they
find it they'll think the body washed away right well because he had opened up
the back it burned off too much fuel and it ended up running out of fuel about a
mile or two before the golf so it ends up landing on a swampy area windshield is
not imploded we're not perfectly intact perfectly intact oh my going through the
trees rips off the wings flips upside down everything but that windshields
fine they catch up with him a couple days later in a campground and so I
write this whole story about him although right away he comes to me and
asked me to write the story so I go okay so I write this story but during the
course of writing the story very quickly I realized he's a pathological liar he's
just blatantly lying to me he's trying to blame everything on his wife trying to
say his wife is all his wife's fault and and so we end up going back forth I
basically convince him and eventually kind of con the truth out of him
throughout the story and I talk about that in the story the story is actually
on my website too same thing just read it right amazing did you finish it or
I'm about about three quarters away through I'm a slow reader that's why I
buy the audio version so I can listen to it you know if you have an apple you
know you could just highlight it and push speak yeah but I don't even have an
iPad that's got my laptop you don't have an iPhone oh yeah I guess I could do it
on my iPhone I do it all the time do you really hate reading I'll get some text
just like I'm like the robot just talks to you yeah just whatever name is yeah
I'll just highlight it push speak boom and it's just what I gotta fucking do I
can't I can't barely read I'm dyslexic I'm horrible yeah so so what what
happens is I write that story shrinker hates the story when I'm done with it
and tells me one thing to do with it and you're an asshole and I was like I
told you weren't gonna be happy why and why did he hate it because he was a
pathological liar and you kind of exposed because I expose and I explained
to him that I explained to all these guys at the beginning look you may not
be thrilled with the way I portray you but it's not up to you you want me to
write the story this is what I do if not go somewhere else get write your own
story you can do that right and they're like no no I read the story you wrote on
so-and-so it's great I want you to do my story and sometimes I say you know if I
just say it the way I see it it's a recurring thing in a lot of stories a
lot of famous stories when they're translated by by storytellers like
yourself in this specific light there's a certain truth to it where it's it's
painted in from a different perspective like your perspective right and a lot of
people who you know have famous stories they try to take them themselves and
try to paint their own picture of their life or of their experiences and it's
never what it is from when someone from the outside it's very difficult to see
yourself for who you are yeah but they would the problem is they wanted they
want to change it to how they want it to be they want to be how they like it and
it's never it's never accurate is never as good right right you want to you
always want to be smoother you always want to be more charming you always
want to have the quick come back and truth is within the moment did I sit I
say it back that fast no it took a minute you know I think white would say
that smoothly or didn't this this didn't happen quite like that you know you're
always trying to there especially if you're telling your own story you're
trying to tweak it a little bit you know because you genuinely see that I
remember right that was one of the things about the one of the memoirs I had
read one of the girls said you know how it's the old joke is that I used to
walk to school five miles uphill both ways you know when I was a kid and she
said it she had written a memoir about herself and she said I really did have
to walk five miles to the bus stop and then back every day she was it was
ridiculous when I was a little kid well that was and then she had moved well
when she later in life like 35 36 years old she had written a memoir and
happened to be taking a trip with her husband and went by her childhood home
to see where she had grown up she goes turns out the bus stop was a quarter of
a mile away from my house she was but as an eight-year-old it seemed like five
miles away she said so did I lie in the memoir no it's my memory right her
memory is is true to her you know they always say that that argument that
whole there's three versions of the truth you know yours and then the truth
right the truth is there is no truth right because there's only two people's
version exactly so anyway so I write I end up then I turn around after
shrinkers book I end up writing a story about from this guy Doug Dodd and Dodd
comes to me and asked me if I'll write the story for him he he's you know please
please please you know and I'm like you don't really have a story it's a drug
story and I don't want to do any drug stories and you know everybody here's
got a drug story so it's like 80% of like just a ton of drug drug dealers in the
lows and mediums and just present so were these guys your story is getting
passed around people are seeing them yeah so you print out I print them out of
course you know you print them out and then I'd have four or five and they'd
be getting passed around so I've constantly had guys coming to me hey I
just read this story do you have any others I'm like well yeah I actually do
and they go can I read it so guys I didn't even know we're coming up to me
cocks I just finished bailout I'm like okay they're like do you got any other
ones like yeah I do come by the unit and I'll give you one so I write this guy
Doug Dodd story and I convince a guy to get a Dodd I end up saying look I'll
write your story but we only if I can get you into a magazine so I write a
bunch of reporters and I out of those reporters they write back and one of
them ends up saying look man I'll pitch it try and get you in a magazine it's an
interesting story because I already written the story I've written a
synopsis of the story same synopsis is on my website so I I write it and I
send it to this guy Ge Lawson because I remember Ge Lawson had written
Deverelli's and it was my end with Ge to say hey I met Deverelli he gave me you
know I know Deverelli from prison by the way can you take a look at this story so
I wrote to several guys with Ge actually contacted me and said look I'm very
interested and so he ends up getting it in Rolling Stone magazine and we were
supposed to write the article together right because it was it he took it from
the from he took my piece and basically Deverelli even rewrote it okay and then
submitted it and he said hey guess what you're gonna be in Rolling Stone
magazine it's gonna be from Ge Lawson and you know Matt Cox and Doug Dodd I was
like that's awesome well just before just before it comes to press he writes me
he emails me and says that the editor at Rolling Stone doesn't want my name on
the article or Dodd's just his I come to find out later after I got out of
prison and talked to him that wasn't true so he yeah he just used the data as an
excuse and then he turns around he sells the options the film rights to it and he
gave Dodd a half of that and then I get a portion of what Dodd gets so we have it
so I get a piece of that option it's been options several times um who's supposed
to do that is it Todd not Todd Phillips is it Todd Phillips supposed to that what
was that story it's called um oxy rush but I end up getting a oxy rush yet on
the on the website it's oxy rush that's what I named it in Rolling Stone it was
called the Dukes of Oxy and then I ended up getting a book deal for Dodd and I'd
written it as a memoir and so the book deal that we got a book deal with Sky
Horse Publishing I mean it was in it was in Barnes & Nobles and you know all the
bookstores so I got we got an advance we got the whole you know it was a book okay
so we I ended up getting a book deal I wrote a whole book for him and it was
called Generation Oxy it's great so it's right and it is a great book Dodd's
same thing one of those guys that when I started writing about him he didn't like
the way he was portrayed he's like you said that I when you know grew up in a
trailer park and then I said no I didn't and first of all I said you I said most
of your stories have that there's trailers makes me sound like I'm white
trash and I'm like I mean what am I supposed to say I mean you're in Hudson
Florida it's a bunch of white guys and growing up in trailers your best friend
that you said was had a bunch of money was rich yeah he lives in a trailer so
yeah but it was a sweet double-wide only white trash would say that so anyway
they're all driving you know they're drive pickup trucks that's hilarious so
anyway he's so once again he wasn't happy with the story necessarily either so a
lot of these guys aren't happy with me but but ultimately it was it is a great
story so and he was at the end he was very happy with the book so but there were
a few times when he was like oh I said this just said that so I remember one
of the chapters I called upper-class white trash high-class white no upper
class white trash and he was furious somebody used to call me that I don't
say I have a problem with that you know I don't stop that much of an insult people
are so in so sensitive yeah they are so what ends up happening is I write that
one then I end up writing another story mm-hmm I wrote a story called God what
was it I wrote one called I mean it just goes on and on I mean I wrote I wrote a
story called you know bent it's about their credit card kid which is probably
the best story I have okay probably one of the best not the probably one of the
best stories I have bent is about a kid that grew up homeless on the streets of
Miami ends up being this one of the most prolific count or credit card
counterfeiters in ever I mean it's it's a total catch me if you can story if you
read it wow just highlight it and just push speak so okay I really ought to do
an audio I will just read them all should I should be you know this I don't
have I have so little time so I'm gonna do it we're gonna do that we're gonna we
gotta record them all and we gotta we gotta post them on somewhere YouTube
channel that would be great cuz we got a YouTube channel already we're just gonna
we're gonna record them all and we're gonna post them on YouTube you know that
I hope you do it I keep getting things that say so-and-so subscribe to your
channel yeah well you made a channel right and you left a couple comments on
the video on the first podcast right so they're seeing your username in the
comments they're clicking on you and subscribing to you but I don't have any
content right but they're still subscribing to you just cuz that's how
YouTube works you don't have to there's channels that have no videos that have
thousands of subscribers that's crazy so yeah YouTube's a weird place man so so
anyway but they should go on there if they see your channel subscribe because
there will be content on there initially I thought well initially I thought they
were subscribing to you and then after I start cuz I saw so-and-so just
subscribed to that I was like okay and then eventually I read it I was like I
got like three of these that today and I'm like this is me so cuz I was thinking
I need to tell Danny hey people are subscribing to your thing so anyway so I
write that one I write the credit card kid one what a just what a great kid a
great story yeah not kidding was like 30 now but just amazing amazing 30 now
yeah he's like 30 something so 30 years old now I mean just if you read it you
just it's just it's one of those things where you read it you go that cannot be
possible and the whole thing is the whole time I'm writing his story by the
way the whole time I'm writing his story he would say stuff and I think it's no
way right there's no way he you know listen the average credit counterfeiter
when they sell cards on like a credit card forum let's say I'm a credit card
counterfeiter and you're in Germany or something you order credit cards from me
fake you know your counterfeit credit cards yeah order a bunch of them blanks
okay you don't order but maybe these guys have minimum orders like 20 or 10
because people want to order like three it's not worth to make in three it's only
$30 you know so they're like no you got to order at least 10 you got to order at
least whatever the amount is he's selling hundreds at a time he's selling
them to Russian to the Russians and Russian some guy running a carding
outfits out throughout Europe that work for the Russians so he's selling a
thousand he's selling 500 he's selling huge amounts and I remember thinking at
one point bullshit it's no way then I get his transcripts and he was caught with
like 400 cards you're in sending 400 cards to one place 400 cards or was it
300 I'd have to look at it for it to be sure but it doesn't matter 300 is
outrageous the average guy gets to they're like 20 so the numbers that he was
giving me were always verified for instance how do you verify that somebody
was homeless he says he was homeless how do I know you're homeless I don't know
that sure enough I and first of all I can't get your juvenile record they
absolutely freedom of information won't allow that so I while I was sending out
freedom of information act to verify other arrests and things that had happened
throughout his life I end up getting a warrant for him and attached the warrant
is another warrant from when he was a missing juvenile and he was homeless and
he had been he had absconded or escaped from the bridges which is a homeless
facility for homeless teens and it says he's a homeless juvenile I mean so I
he's homeless he said he was homeless it's perfectly is verified I can verify
now I had like two or three pieces of paper that will list him as homeless as
it when he was like 15 and 16 years old right still ended up getting a high
soul diploma which I was taught find that amazing so he's just got it's just
literally I'm all as I'm getting these documents it's it's just phenomenal the
whole story and you're getting I'm getting indictments and I can see this is
him on the indictment here's another he's this is another one he's indicted
here's that you know you can you get all this stuff and you get this the freedom
of information act what's so funny about getting it in is that technically you're
not allowed to have other inmates material but because the CO's and the
SIS which runs like the internal security they knew what I was doing they would
every once in a while they'd catch something coming through freedom of
information coming through the coming through the mailroom and they'd call me
into SIS and they would say and they would go hey Cox we got an indictment on
so-and-so and then we also have this one this is a police report and they go
what's going on I go I'm writing a story they go well what's the story I go okay
listen the kid was grew up homeless on the streets of my and I tell him real
quick boom boom boom when they'd sit there and they go that's a good fucking
story okay he's okay with you having this I'm like do I need to call him I'm
like no man he knows I'm okay here I mean it was that they were that cool with
me it was great I would every once when I go and knock on the door after something
was supposed to show up two weeks earlier I'd knock on the door and I go
hey do you have any mail for me and they're like hold on Cox I think we do
have something yeah this and they get a sealed package and give it to me they
go hey wait a minute do I need to look at that I go no it's just an indictment
for a guy that's no big deal and they're like okay well it was it was really
hilarious wow I got called in one time because a homicide detective had called
cuz I'd ordered a bunch of I'd ordered a bunch of documents for two witnesses
from a guy another guy's story I wrote called indefensible were two of his
witnesses get they die of mysterious circumstance they die of overdoses they
die end up dying of overdoses they live about a mile or two from the from the
DEA agent who gets indicted also and ends up killing himself in the middle of
his own case the same agent that ended up getting my buddy indicted so his two
main witnesses die mysteriously just before the trial and he ends up going to
trial doesn't have his witnesses and the only real and the guy that got him
indicted is this DEA agent so he my buddy ends up getting 20 years and then the
DEA agent ends up getting indicted himself for lying in this got my buddy's
case who's now in jail I mean it's just I know that the DEA agent ended up
killing himself second day of trial it goes home that night sticks a gun in his
mouth blows his brains out that's what I'm sure the DEA agent was responsible
for the witnesses dying that I mean I you know I don't know that I don't know
that they both died of the same chemical compound that killed both of them they
were both witnesses they were both you know one of them is a CI who's going to
get on the stand and say this guy had nothing to do with it right the other
one is a guy who's gonna get on the stand and say I'm the one that owned the
place I'm the one opened it this guy lives in California he doesn't live in
Louisiana he had nothing to do with the running of the cop of the company wow
instead my guy goes in and he basically is the guy that looks like he's running
the whole thing so the point is is so I wrote that story so once again I called
in they're like we got a DE I gotta I got a homicide detective from Louisiana
colony are you ordering documents from a dead DEA agent that committed suicide
I'm like hey that's freedom of information act I need that I'm sitting there
arguing with them and they're like well you got your own stuff on dead people
people are killing themselves and I'm like I'm gonna say freedom of
information act I need it so you know that's one thing that was funny on the
podcast like I was reading some of the comments and some of these guys like I
don't believe what he's saying I wouldn't believe this guy's DNA results yeah
it's like it's like I'm like okay there's evidence you know I'm saying I don't
have to make it up I'm sorry that you work at Walmart yeah people are lazy
you know I'm saying and that the comments are just like the comments I
think I told you this the comment section is just like road rage it's
equivalent to road rage somebody's in their car they're pissed off about
something they're mad at their how their day went and you fucking cut them off
they're gonna scream fucking flick you off fuck you but as soon as you guys are
if you guys were face-to-face in that situation that would never happen you
know it's like when I said the whole I have a degree in fine arts I must have
said it a bunch because people started making these comments like oh what is
either they were mocking me and I went through and I was like one guy was like
oh he went on and on I said hey listen man I guess I said a lot and I'm sorry
my back I didn't realize that sorry came back and said he comes back and says hey
bro no it was all jokes man you're awesome it's great and I'm like yeah
they're just trying to get some likes yeah yeah trying to get a rise out of
something anyway some of them are really funny that yeah some of them were
pretty funny so the one guy said he'd take a shot every time he says he's got
a degree in fine arts and then he says he's one guy said I've already got alcohol
poisoning I'm only ten minutes in so I love it okay so I ended up writing I'm
writing these stories right I mean I write one cash and coke I write cash
logistics I write pain I write so I'm writing these synopses and I'm also
writing books okay and guys are coming to me left and right with their stories
how deep are you into your sentence right now oh god I was 2000 this started
it started in 2012-13 but here's the thing at the same time I meet a guy
named Frank Amadeo Frank you've heard it because I think I mentioned his story
he's the guy who is he was a lawyer he's disbarred he is a rapid cycling
bipolar with features of schizophrenia and he has lost his rights he has an
actual guardian he stole a hundred and eighty million dollars from the federal
government and was using it to try and take over the world I mean literally how
did he steal a hundred and he thinks God's talking to him and he thinks God
he thinks he's preordained to be emperor of the world and he will have a serious
conversation with you about it and he knows how insane it sounds and it's the
most amazing thing you've ever talked about I'm the whole time was locked up
12 and a half years I never met anybody never met a criminal that was
literally a bond villain he's a bond villain he is a James Bond villain he
wants to take over the world because he's been preordained by God to be
emperor of the world and what's the title of that and he's not a drooling
idiot he's a fucking lawyer he's crazy but he's crazy brilliant oh the
name of that story is oh it's insanity it's insanity this is a guy who there
was a coup there was an attempted they said the the condolese that said in the
Congo the Congo government said that he backed a political coup or a coup to take
over the Congo he didn't he says that's not what happened you know he might he's
trying to buy airplanes he's trying he's got a he owns a security company that is
like a small blackwater type security company they're providing security in
Afghanistan he owns a company that built satellite a portable satellites for
the government he he owns all these different companies and he's built
really building up like an internal like little militia and he's planning on
taking over the Congo and then going throughout all of Africa he told you all
this there's a there's a there matter of fact there is a documentary on him on
YouTube called nine days in the Congo okay and it talks about how he had sent
these guys the Congo and they end up getting the Congolese end up kidnapping
them and they say they were trying to take it was a military takeover it's
like a they were gonna they had guns and they had this and he's saying that's not
what was happening I was just backing a political candidate he had ex-secret
service agents working for him FBI military guys I mean he's it's serious
wow he got 22 years so anyway I meet Frank and I go to Frank and I say Frank
and you know hey he's like oh Matt yeah I've talked to you a few times how are
you doing I'm like good good you mind this guy thinks he's taking over the
world so you gotta be you gotta be tread lightly yeah you never know what
Frank's gonna do so he's bipolar so he's a how's it going I said well look you
know my buddy told me to talk to you you know I got 26 years and he's like yeah I
heard you had a big sentence I'm like right I said well here's the thing I did
dateline and this is and I tell him what they told me this is what the government
told me so my attorney told me and he goes well your attorney didn't
understand the law because he the to get a sentence reduction or a rule 35 you
have to have a rest or you can further the investigation but it has to do with
a criminal matter and doing a public service announcement isn't a part of
that or an interview isn't a part of that I said well I don't have any arrests
this is what they told me to do so and he's like yeah well she misunderstood the
law so we can follow 255 I'm like yeah but you only have one year from your
sentence to follow 255 and he goes well yeah unless there's new evidence he said
so when when was the last time you know so we start talking and he says yeah I
think we can get around that I think we can do something called equitable tolling
which every time they ask you to do something it resets the one year and he
said when was the last time I said well I just did this ethics and fraud course and
it just came out but they just told me they wouldn't give me a sentence
reduction he's okay when did it when did you do that I said this time he goes
okay well we'll go with that date so he I'd already talked to a lawyer on the
street and a lawyer on the street said there's nothing they could do I was
doomed so you know it just I had talked to Ross Reeback which with my literary
agent he had contacted his sister his sister said there's just nothing he can
do he contacted another lawyer he said he's nothing he can do but my crazy
lawyer Frank says yeah I think I can get you a sentence reduction and what Frank
doesn't charge either by the way so what I don't have anything to lose right
fuck it yeah let's go for him an exchange right now well I did write his
story but not then I didn't write it then I wasn't even planning on writing it
then he just does the he does the paperwork for a ton of guys he's got
like 30 40 50 he's working like 50 people's cases at all time you understand
he has he has guys that do nothing but type for him he has guys that do he's
he teaches the legal research class the ace like I teach the real estate he
taught the legal research class well which so he's training an army of drug
dealers and sex offenders to do research on the on the legal computer and type
up people's motions he's got a small law really he's got a good-sized law firm
inside the prison so amazing wow so he takes all my stuff he writes it all up
I send it in months later government comes back and says absolutely not yes
what mr. Cox is saying is true but he's time-barred means it's been more than one
year and the equity there is no there is no equitable tolling you know there's
no no that doesn't apply so okay fine so we go then the judge comes back says
okay now then we file a retort then they file a motion back and then we're
about to file another motion and suddenly the government sends an emotion and
says your honor we'd like for you to appoint a lawyer for mr. Cox so that I
could speak with so we can discuss filing a rule 35 for him a sentence
reduction okay so we're willing to file a sentence reduction for you wow but you
understand it's how much now it's how much right and they're saying you have
to drop your your your 2255 your motion you have to drop this and we'll file
something so I don't really trust them of course not they fly a lawyer down
lawyer flies down I meet her at Coleman you know that take me in the
in the lawyer's room and we sit out I sit down with the attorney client room and
I sit down with her and she says okay I've read your motion and she says you
know Matt it's very well written but you really don't have a chance I mean it's
you're gonna lose that the motion and she said I mean it's just it's not gonna
work and I went okay she said but you did do a good job I said well I didn't
write that and she goes well who wrote it I said Frank wrote it and she goes
Frank who I go Frank Amadeus who's that I said he's a disbarred lawyer she's got
a disbarred lawyer right your right do your do is doing your legal work she's
in here and I went oh yeah I said really be honest I said it's worse than that
I said he's mentally incompetent I said he's lost his rights I said he has a
guardian I said he he thinks he's emperor of the world and she is what I said
you know he's mentally he is he's he's got mental problems he's he's crazy I
said I mean I can say that because he's legitimately crazy I've got doctors that
say he's crazy and that she's like and that's who did your legal work and I go
yeah because all the same lawyers on the streets that I didn't have a chance she
goes Matt you don't have a chance I go and yet they appointed you no I said and
yet they're already saying they're willing to file a reduction for me and
you're here so I said who's crazy I said you wouldn't have filed it nobody else
would right and she goes okay well they're saying that they'll they're only
gonna give you one level that's it she says but they will bring you back in
front of the court and let you argue for more and I went I said okay I'll go
with that because that's what Frank had told me look just whatever they offer you
at tell him you want to go back in front of the judge so I said I'll do that so I
go to Frank I explained it to Frank Frank says go back argue so we go back we
argue in front of the judge mr. Cox did this mr. Cox did this mr. Cox did that
then the judge that we were asking for like we were asking for like nine levels
off which would have been like immediate release almost basically it was
immediately released well and I don't lead I'd already done I'd already done
like seven or eight years at this point well this was 2013 so I'd done I'd done
six six years no seven I wait I'd done seven years so I go back from the judge
and the judge goes okay the government says your honor we want you to give him
one level that's 40 months off his sentence and I'm we're saying we want
immediate release and the judge goes okay okay well I've listened to the
government I've listened to you and he said to the government he said what
mr. Cox has done for all these public service announcements he said what you're
asking for one level isn't nearly enough I'm thinking yeah he is mr. Cox he said
you're asking for nine levels which would almost be immediate release he said
that was never gonna happen like oh my god and he goes I thought about it I'm
giving you three levels wow three levels was seven years hold keep mine
every level gets smaller and smaller as you go so like 40 the next level would
have been like 37 the next level would been you know it keeps dropping it so it
ended up being like seven years that's huge which was a big deal but keep mine
with that seven years a recalculator gain time takes me from my out date takes my
out date down to like is it too much time no okay so sorry so what happens is
I get seven years off I go back once again when I was in front of the judge
and I had talked by the way crying like a baby I mean just pathetic crying it's
just it was the worst row so no no no I just got so fucking emotional because
your whole life's on the line you know it's just and I mean I'm you know I'm
kind of a pussy okay so I just you know it's just it's just such an emotional
situation so you know I go back to Coleman so instead of my out date 2030
now it's like it's like 2024 low 24 high 23 basically it's 24 okay so it's good
because they recalculate you get your gain time you don't really get it seven
years off that because you remember you get your chunk off to begin with so now
you're not doing as much time so you get less gain time so it's really not seven
years it ends up being like six years I got it instead of 23 my out date being
2023 it's gonna be like 2024 so the point is is now it's like I mean it's still
it's it's I've got like nine more years to go right you know it's ridiculous and
up so I get there I remember I went to Frank and I said hey Frank I said he
was here I heard you got seven years off I said yeah I said and I appreciate it man
I said because we were hoping for half you know and I said but I mean I fuck I
got like eight nine years to go and he looked at me and he goes how much time
did he have by the way you remember oh Frank 22 years 22 yeah so Frank looked at
me he goes I said yes it's still a lot of like eight nine years left to go and
he goes like this he goes we're gonna have to eat this elephant one spoonful at
a time he said you just we'll figure something out else out we'll we're gonna
get this taken care of don't you worry I was like okay but you know it was much
more doable oh yeah you know so so I'm still writing stories mm-hmm I'm still
corresponding with a bunch of uh with reporters and so 2000 and this fight like
like this was basically now 2014 so 2014 comes along 2014 comes along and
I'm writing all these stories and my mom's coming to see me and you know now
I'm just thinking okay well I've got I got like nine years left I think I'd
like yeah I'd like yeah I had like nine years left so eight or nine years I
think I always said like eight because I was gonna take the drug program you get
a year off for the drug program I was like so you know like a one day I'm
sitting there and now keep in mind too them cutting my sentence is unheard of
for somebody that did not have any arrests so keep in mind people don't
understand right right yeah right so didn't flip on anybody that led to an
arrest that led to an arrest oh trust me I tried tried to try to right so you
know and that you know and there are people you know oh he's a rat he's this
fuck you you do the time you know I'm saying I mean you don't know what you're
talking about so the point is is is that so that was just unheard of and that's
like Frank Abagnale stuff you know catch me if you can he cooperates with the
FBI they get him out of prison but you know if you've ever read the book which
I read both of his books one was catch me if you can the second one was the
artist steel guess what they didn't get him out of jail he did all of his time
you know the movie you've seen the movie oh yeah yeah remember how at the end
Tom Hanks talks to him and they get him out of jail to come help him yeah it's
not what happened he actually does all of his time he's actually turned out for
parole the first time really he does all of his time he gets out he's on
probation he ends up eventually working with the FBI periodically really just
teaches classes at Quantico okay and he and he teaches banks and then
eventually opens up his own secured dunk document company where he makes
secured documents he makes like tickets that are hard to hard to counterfeit you
know for like the Super Bowl stuff like that right so so I mean that you know I'm
saying so people are like oh yeah yeah like Frank so that's what happened like
Frank Abagnale yeah no not like Frank Abagnale because it didn't really
happen with Frank Abagnale okay but I right but I actually got my sentence
reduced for for these things and for writing the ethics fraud course so now
I'm sitting here so I'm still writing the stories and I'm thinking okay well
fuck it I mean I'm gonna have a bunch of books when I get out and a bunch of
stories and maybe I can do something you know I start kind of having a game
plan and okay well if I write so many stories and maybe if I can get a film
agent I could option some of these stories and there was a guy named Jeff
Jeff Joshua Bierman who had come out with a website called Epic and he he
wrote the story that became the movie Argo okay for about the hostages yeah
yeah he wrote a story called The Great Escape which was in Wired and it got
bought by it was actually bought like Matt Damon then it turned into Brad Pitt
then Brad Pitt sold it to to um what's the guy's name that ended up was in the
movie um Brian Cranston Brian Cranston no no the guy that was in the movie was
in Argo Argo wasn't Brian Cranston in Argo I don't know he was the lead role
Argo the guy for Breaking Bad no no I'm talking about Argo Argo oh you're he
wasn't it but he was like the CIA director he's the main guy main guy's
Ben Affleck Ben Affleck okay he ends up buying it and getting it produced so
but I'm saying Bierman had come up with the concept that I'm gonna start writing
stories I'm just gonna stick them on a fucking website and let people bid on
them right option in that way yeah so I thought that's what I could do I could
get in I could get a website going I could put them on the website maybe if I
guess I'm on the street to help me you know so I'm trying to figure out
something I could do from in prison because the one thing you can do in
prison you're not allowed to run a business but you are allowed to write
books and articles and sell them piece mail you can't work for you I can't
work for the New York Times on a W-2 but I can write articles and and and sell
them and sell them well and right you could be an independent contractor for
the New York Times or for Rolling Stone okay but you can't work on a W-2
then you're an employee yep so I thought I can start doing that and it turns out
and then Sean Woods ends up reaching out to me from Rolling Stone and asked me
to start sending him stories story ideas other guys other reporters start
reaching out to me and you know so things are going good right so things are
alright so and I'm writing books and this guy comes on the compound by the
name of Ron Wilson Ron Wilson was like 66 67 years old he comes on and he's a he
is a gruff old guy pissed off irritable and he's he is from South Carolina he
had run a Ponzi scheme for I want to say 10 to 15 years okay we stole 57 million
dollars think he actually said he stole over a hundred million or something but
he had paid out so much so it ended up being a 57 million dollar Ponzi scheme
wow where the bulk of the money that he had taken is from people for their
retirement funds so you're giving him your money thinking he's investing it in
silver and you think that you've been giving him 20,000 every year for 10
years and you think you've got three million dollars but the truth is you
don't have nothing so your whole retirement is gone and you're 67 you're
about to retire he's done this for 57 million dollars he's got forget how many
victims a hundred and some odd a thousand victims or something 900 victims I
forget what the dollar amount was and so for some reason he didn't talk to
anybody somebody came up to him you know that's a whole click thing there's the
white guys the black guys the Hispanic guys that sort of thing so and there's a
lot of sex offenders right so one of this the white guys like the solid white
guys don't want to talk to you know nobody wants to deal with the sex
vendors and a lot of sex vendors will come in and they'll say they're here for
fraud for some reason they think they could get away with that so but you get
how does that how do they get exposed for a lot how do you get caught lying
very quickly you get caught because for one thing what happened is this guy
Kenny King would say Cox come here and I go ah Christ what can you just fucking
see this white guy over here and I go yeah Kenny and he go he says he's here for
fraud go talk to him I go the fuck Kenny I don't want to go talk to the fucking
guy he says he's here for Friday he he looks like it you know what they call
sex offenders in prison they call me their pedophile no they call him Chomo's
for child or they call him Mo's so they go he looks like a fucking Chomo to me
and I'd be like I don't give a fuck if he's a Chomo what bro just don't talk to
me go I don't want him sit in the TV room with us see they get the white TV room
the black TV room the Hispanic TV room he's like I don't want him in that room
if he's a sex offender right and he goes go talk to him see if he's in and I'm
like fuck so I go over and I go hey man what's up my name is Matt I said I'm here
for fraud too I heard you're here for fraud and the guy would like yeah I'm here for
fraud too okay what kind of fraud yep that's all you need yeah I go what kind
of fraud they go I remember this is exact a conversation I had a guy with a guy
on time he goes um it was credit card fraud and I went credit card fraud I
said okay how much time did you get he goes um I got I got three years three
years it's like the minimum it's like a minimum mandatory for sex offenders most
you get but minimums you pretty much get is three years and I got three years I
went okay so what were you doing he's there was credit card fraud I said so
were you were you carding were you counterfeiting cards no I was I was doing
credit card fraud I said I understand but what were you doing were you getting
blanks were you getting fulls were you buying them off of a off of a forum
where were you getting the cards right well I was I was taking little bits of
money out of multiple people's cards and that's why I got away with it for so
long that's why I got so much time so much time you got three years and I was
like that's not a lot of time I went so how would you get the money out of the
cards I don't understand what what you were doing yeah and he looks at me
goes um it's it's it's not a this isn't a learning experience and I went oh it's
total bullshit okay and I looked over I remember Kenny was sitting there I looked
at Kenny and I go he's a chomo and I was just walked off and and remember Kenny
goes he goes how did you Kenny goes uh he's how can you be so sure I said
because I said the bulk of fraud guys are narcissistic and are arrogant they
can't wait to brag to you about their crime I don't know if you notice this I
know I know in the comments in the comment section for sure this guy's
bragging he's shit yeah you're right I brag I come off arrogant I and absolutely
and I am you know it's not that I don't know that I what I've done is wrong right
but it's that I get excited about it I you know you I can't wait to tell
everybody hey look how smart I look what I figured out you know it's and it's
fucking obnoxious but I've never met a fraud guy that doesn't do it he didn't
do it and that's the one thing they couldn't fake you might even if he had
his story down and he knew what he was doing right his character is his
character's off so sure enough he ended up being a sex offender and he I
forget he's downloading child porn or something so you know there's so
many weirdos so anyway what ends up happening is so Kenny sees me and Kenny
goes hey Cox this guy just got here they see that old guy right there and I'm
like yeah he goes Ponzi scheme this is the Ponzi scheme guy Wilson he goes go
talk to him and I went fuck yeah he looks like he might be a
I remember I looked at him and I mean I just looked at him and I went no he's
here for fraud really oh you could just tell how arrogant arrogant listen
nobody whole time I was there nobody ever came up to me or met me for even a
minute and said sex offender right ever he talked to me for two minutes you're
like fucking cocky motherfucker yeah he's ain't a sex turner he's fucking here
for fraud or something so sure enough I went fuck so but I thought you know he
is here for fraud I could tell I just see it so I walk over to him I said hey
I said you just get here he's like yeah I mean did this did one of these let me
blatant yeah and I'm like I already like him I was like I said some they said
you were here for fraud I'm here for fraud too he's like and I said and he
goes what'd you get I go I don't know like they said like 15 million or
something I said but it was my my dollar loss is like six million dollars and he
looked at me he goes yeah 57 million like your shit trying to outdo you yeah
yeah exactly and I remember thinking I said nice that's a nice lick like that
and he goes yeah it was all right and so now he's like you know he's like yeah
kindred spirits you know yeah yeah I said what what was it what would you do
and he goes it's a Ponzi scream I said what was the conveyance what was the
what'd you use and he goes silver I said nice I said so what how I don't what
were you trading the silver or and yes yeah it was commodity I was trading the
silver on the you know I would always I was a silver dealer and I was so he
starts explaining it now he loves me yeah I'm interested and we're talking the
same language yeah how do you how did you get your clients how did you get we
start talking sit it's over he loves me yeah nobody likes him why not well first
of all he was cooperating against other people that had helped him okay to how
did anybody know that though well because they brought him back to court okay so
one day you just got sentenced and four months later you're on the pack out list
sorry the list where they're packing your stuff up and you're moving so he gets
moved two weeks later he's back where'd you go it wasn't two weeks there's like
three weeks later he comes back where did you go for three weeks you didn't go
to another prison and get transferred you went back to court and came back maybe
it was a month or so but he left and came back actually the first time I think
it was only like three or four weeks because I don't think he made it the
first time like they they changed the court date so they sent him back then
like two months go by they do it again everybody's like he's cooperating right
fucking guys he's he's being moved back and forth he's cooperating so you know
and and so one they don't like him because he's a snitch even though like I
said at Coleman 50% of the population at Coleman's basically sex offenders the
other 50% of the population 90% of them cooperated so you know basically like I
said out of every unit out of 150 guys you got about six guys that didn't
cooperate okay so you've got all these guys who took please but you know who
who didn't cooperate the guys that went to trial very few people go to trial so
you went to trial you lost you so you didn't cooperate so you got the guys
that took please which all cooperated sitting there saying fucking snitch we
fucking snitch you had a 25-year sentence you're doing 15 shut up you know
I'm saying right how did that happen right what you're talking about but see
you know I you're there long enough guys start talking about their case and as
they say stuff oh I got caught with fucking 10 bricks and you're thinking
boop that's a 25-year minimum mandatory how's this guy doing 15 right they just
slip up mm-hmm so the point is is a is a they don't like him for all the wrong
reasons so but he liked me so we start walking around and hanging out and
everything and he was particularly could be a particularly vicious person he
also had moments when he cried about his crimes just in tears talking about
them and other times when he would talk about doing something absolutely
vicious we're talking about taking some woman who's got like multiple sclerosis
and taking her last dollar and she thinks she's got a million dollars in the
bank and she hands over three or four hundred thousand dollars and he just
pisses it away and it's like fuck she she thought you ran it up to over a
million dollars in a year and what'd you do with it he goes I think I bought this
antique carriage what is he at he bought a lot of antiques he's always
beautiful and I also but it's like are you serious and you're like fuck I mean
she's got multiple sclerosis he's like so what you know I'm saying was those
kind of one minute but just he was he was a complicated guy yeah so anyway the
point is that I'm walking around with them and he keeps talking about how he
actually literally dug up money he had money buried in in ammunition cans these
big 10 cans he had money buried cash and actual gold and bullion and and and
silver so when he got caught eventually he goes and actually digs up the money
and gives the Secret Service several million dollars Secret Service always
thought that there was money he had hidden and they were arguing with him he
was saying that's not true they're like at a 57 million you only put aside a
couple million come on bullshit he's like what are you talking about I also had
the money in the bank that you got and they're like no you didn't give us all
the money but they couldn't prove it it's too complicated there's too much cash
involved and that sort of thing yeah so we're walking he's like yeah I'm really
worried about this I said don't worry about it they're gonna you're gonna
cooperate they're gonna give you a sin introduction oh they're not they're not
they're not he said they're gonna they're gonna fuck me you watch it just
like they fucked you and you're I'm like well then you'll follow 2255 we'll
have Frank do it you'll you'll be fine yeah you know just keep doing what
you're doing and we'll take care it'll be taken care of so this goes on for
months and months and months he's going back and forth and so one day we're
walking around and he says you know I got fucking like eight years left best
case maybe nine two thousand and this is 2016 at this point no two thousand yeah
2015 I think it's 2015 I'd have to check I don't quote me on the record so so
we're walking one day and he says I'm really worried about them this the money
there I think they're gonna they're gonna find that money they're gonna look
for that money I'm like I you don't know if they're looking for it all there
now they're they're gonna fuck me over I go bro I said listen what are you doing
if there's no money hidden which he told me at other times there's no money I
said there's no money hidden they can't they have to they'd have to find the
money so you're good so don't worry about it and he goes like what are you
worried about and he goes he looks at me goes can I trust you I go I remember
specifically said probably not and he goes he goes I did put away some money
I went really I said you bury it and he goes no I gave a hundred and fifty
thousand dollars to my wife but now she's divorcing me now we're getting the
board and his wife hates his guts because he was having an affair with this
woman she found out during the course of this whole thing she finds out he's
been having an affair for a couple years so she hates his guts he's like she
hates my guts so much she'll probably turn the money in I said nah I said she's
been hiding too long she'll get in trouble at this point and he goes no I
don't know I don't know and so I keep walking and we're walking and walking and
then he says he says I said so it's a hundred fifty thousand dollars I said you
know we're not gonna find it goes well problem is my brother my brother's got
some money too he's got like 30 grand and I went okay so your brother he
was well if they start interviewing people I said well they're not going to
relax you're gonna be fine and I remember walking around thinking did he just
tell me he's hiding Ponzi scheme money did he just fucking tell me that and I
remember thinking is that enough for me to get a sentence reduction for the first
thing that you thought of first thing I thought of I mean look I'd love to tell
you you know that you know oh I struggled with it and I did struggle with it I
laid in bed for about a month or so telling myself it was probably a month
laying in bed thinking that's not enough it's not that I had a problem cutting
his throat no problem at all right I don't want to do that he doesn't give a
fuck about you you don't care about me I don't care about him I've seen too many
fucking guys make the mistake of maybe not saying something like not telling on
somebody and then like I'm not I just took a plea and went to prison and did my
ten years more like I told you about the one guy like tough guys who yeah yeah
fuck that I'm not gonna tell on nobody I'm not gonna tell fuck that and they
they get ten years and then I'm not gonna tell on my buddies and then their
buddy gets caught I told you about the one guy you got like 12 years then then
these other two guys get caught first thing they do is that he could have
told on them he doesn't then they get caught for something else first thing
they do is they tell on him he gets another ten years he ends up doing 20 I
mean I've seen that happen several times so they thought they had too much
dignity they had too much self-respect to snitch on somebody I'm not gonna
snitch on right I'm not gonna break the code I'm yeah yeah there is no code and
in those guys ended up turning up flipping on him of course not just that
the you know many times people will like not they will not cooperate they
won't cooperate against someone and then the moment they get sentenced and sent to
prison that person cuts them off they don't send them money they don't come
see them they don't do anything so and then they end up getting busted at six
months later a year later because they're still fucking selling drugs or
doing something and then they in they try and get you in trouble or even if
they don't it doesn't matter the point is is that and it telling you because you
were a buddy of mine and then you fucking abandoned me right you know the
whole omarta thing is that while I'm in prison you'll help take care of me and
my family you'll you'll you know no that's not what happens it's a fucking
lie it's fiction right so most white collar criminals and drug dealers and
everybody across the board 90% of them basically roughly cooperate so sex
offenders like I said typically don't have the option there's no one to
cooperate against you're on a computer you're looking at some guys looking up
porn child porn they they bust him right who's it gonna cooperate against
alone in his room yeah so the point is is that so I think I had a like I told
you earlier had another guy in the podcast mafia guy who basically said
that there's there's no there's no nothing in the mafia there's no code
that code is broken constantly in the mafia even right nobody does not snitch
on somebody else there's always guys that are rolling other people flipping
other people in the there's no code of honor it's broken constantly yeah it's
over it's it's it's just fools and if you in and that's how he ended up getting
all his time right yeah and what's so funny is that people will sit there you
got some guy who works at fucking Walmart who's like fuck dad I wouldn't say
anything you work at Walmart you don't tell me how to be a fucking gangster okay
you're not a fucking tough guy you would you work at Walmart stop it right so
you've got those guys who sit there and they've watched they watched a couple of
movies and they think they know how it is but you don't know shit till that
fucking door locks and nobody'll answer your calls somebody else is calling your
kid dad or your dad your your kids call somebody else daddy and your girlfriends
not answer the fucking phone and you're going fuck God that's gotta be the
fucking worst feeling oh it's the worst the guys that have wives and shit and go
to prison for five years and they're on the phone on Saturday morning going why
did you fucking answer the phone what where the fuck were you with it's like
oh Jesus bro what are you doing there's torturing themselves it's horrible
it's horrible so you know it's it's just that whole thing is just it's a fucking
myth it's bullshit and what's always funny is that if you're if your daughter
your son got raped or killed and the neighbors saw the person you'd want him
to cooperate oh for sure I mean you know if so-and-so had stolen if your parents
had lost their life savings and I knew where that money was and I could help
get your parents life savings back you want me to cooperate right people just
don't want you to cooperate when they're involved so so Wilson tells me this
and I'm like you're gonna be fine you're gonna be fine you told you where the
Ponzi scheme money was this yes some of the months he just told me a little bit
or he gave it to individuals he didn't actually have cash hidden like right he
gave some cash to his wife who now hates his guts that's a problem and to his
brother who's like a devout Christian or something okay so he's concerned and I
said you're gonna be fine I'm sure it's no big deal show us no big deal so I lay
in bed thinking should I say something they didn't want to give me anything last
time the US attorney was pissed they gave me seven years she's not gonna give me
anything this time so I thought so I go to Frank and I mentioned it to Frank oh
you did yeah I went to Frank and talked to Frank and Frank went I don't know
Maddie so I'm not there it's whatever it is we're gonna have to fight whatever
happens so I end up having to call my attorney because I needed to get my
transcripts because I was I was wanting to get my new transcripts to kind of put
them in my memoir you know that because I got my sentence reduced and I wanted to
be able to pull some excerpts out of the transcripts even though it had been a
few years so I call her up and I'm talking she's everything going on what
else I got it I got you I'm gonna send him to you and everything else going
okay and I was like yeah everything's fine she is okay anything happening you
anything you want to talk about and it was almost like she read my mind I was
like yeah yeah there is listen this guy and I tell her and she goes oh my god
that sounds like a rule 35 to me she's let me call the agent what's his name and
I said his name is like Tom Griffin or something in Secret Service out of out
of South Carolina she's well let me look it up and while she was on the phone
she actually looked it up and was like oh wow this guy stole a bunch of money oh
yeah yeah hold on let me check it out like two weeks later I get suddenly an
officer comes to me and goes Cox you got to go to SIS I'm like okay so I go to
SIS walk in SIS officer goes Cox come in here I go what's up he said I don't know
I just told to put you on the phone with this guy pick up the phone boom he was
hey I got Cox here right now hold on hands into my go hi he goes this is Tom
Griffin Secret Service you know Special Agent of the Secret Service out of South
Carolina it's my understanding is you know we're we're Wilson hid some money
and I'm like fuck I'm like yeah but straight to the fucking punch like what's
going on he said how much I said yeah but it's not a lot of money and it's it's
not what you think it's not millions he's I don't care how much it is I got
900 victims blah blah I was like okay well it's not a lot of money I said but I
want something from the government that says they're gonna consider money he
is well we're gonna get he's well I'm gonna get you he said don't worry I'll
make sure you're you get cooperation for this and we're gonna get your
sentence reduced for this I use I mean I'll make sure you get basically said
something like a rule 35 for this I said well you're not in a position to
offer that I said you and I both know you already learned your lesson you don't
have authorization and I said I need the US Attorney to say that they will
consider the recovery of a substantial amount of money as substantial
assistance and reduce my sentence because that's what Frank told me to say
right and he said it has to they have to say they have to agree that money will
be considered because I didn't think it was enough money that they would charge
these people so I'm thinking nobody's gonna get charged right they're just
gonna recoup the money if they go and they ask the wife for the money we know
you got 150,000 she's gonna give it to them they're not gonna charge her that's
that's the way I felt I thought so I just the recovery of just the money so it
was okay okay okay so I end up he sends me this letter saying this from the US
Attorney US Attorney sends me sends it to him he sends to me I get them on my
email I'm emailing him looking over my shoulder all the fucking time you know
what are you looking at me yeah it's a horrible situation you know so so I'm
emailing this guy he sends me a letter and he sends my lawyer a letter from the
and they say recovery of a substantial amount of money we will consider
substantial substantial assistance for a first sentence reduction great this is
my US Attorney said this my new one my new might the new US Attorney um so okay
so I I he starts asking me questions to ask Wilson I asked Wilson this ask him
that Wilson's telling me I'm like hey whatever happened with so-and-so you
told me hey this okay that go back I said well he said this that guy's not
involved and you know he's trying to get people who's roped in people roped in
I'm like there is nobody else right it's Wilson and the other guys that you
know about right that he's cooperating with you again keep in mind those two
guys two other guys they end up like pleading guilty so they're they're done
so they're now they're saying now they don't want to give him anything he's
very worried so so he's thinking he's not gonna get it get anything anyway so
we're walking and walking and I'm working with these guys and trying to help
them out but the truth is all I knew was about a little bit of money right so
they go ahead and they interview the wife so wife comes in and says I don't have
shit I don't have nothing I know it's talking about she leaves really the
next day she comes back and dumps like 350 thousand dollars and says boom in
cash gold silver I mean he said 150 so you didn't say 150 no I said I told them
150 she turned over like 350 thousand dollars oh shit and I was like and so he
comes to me so the Secret Service sends me an email saying listen Wilson's
about to get some really bad news I don't want to be specific but let me know
what he says so fucking Wilson comes up to me one day he's like cocks I'm gonna
talk to you I went yeah what's up he goes they question my wife she went in a
couple days ago and she didn't tell him anything I thought that's good see I told
you and he goes no no no she went back yesterday and she turned in 300 and some
odd thousand dollars in cash and another fifty thousand in jewelry and gold and I
go fuck I thought you said it was like 120 or 150 and he goes I didn't really
trust you I went okay well okay well I said fuck you so what do you think that
means for me I go he had no suspicion of you no I said I think you're fucked I
said you really fucked that's a fucked up situation because now you've been
lying what did she say he goes oh she said I gave her their money and I went
fuck he was I just you know I don't know what's gonna happen now he was they're
supposed to interview my brother in a couple days they interview for the
brother the brother walks in with his attorney and they say before he says
anything he'd like to turn over this hundred and fifty thousand dollars or
we're like half a million dollars almost it was not quite half a million the total
what them to now we're at half a million almost so he tells me that couple
days later he finds that out comes and tells me fuck so months go by nothing
happens eventually the wife gets indicted the brother gets indicted he gets
re-indicted they scoop him up and they take him away that's it last you heard
last I heard of well no not last I heard about heard of him keep in mind he goes
back and when they indict him they give you your discovery who do you thinks all
over his discovery on his new case that Cox nothing but me talking to these guys
and emails wow he pleads guilty now initially I was thinking okay well I
should get something for this I didn't expect anything and I got a way more
money recovered than I thought well guess what Wilson got six months added
onto his sentence that's it sit his wife and brother got one got like a hundred
community hours and one got like three or six months probation or maybe a year
probation so nothing virtually nothing happens to them what about you and I'm
thinking well if nothing happened then fuck and I go back and I talk to the
you to the agent I call him on the phone and he says I said so what's gonna
happen have you made a recommendation for me to get a reduction he said yep I
sent it a couple days ago I sent it to your US attorney I said okay great he is
and I sent it to your attorney I said okay great so I could oh no I sent not he
didn't send it my turn he just sent there to the US attorney there he said I
told your attorney about I said okay great call my lawyer my lawyer calls US
attorney they're not called on her back this goes on and on for months we're
talking about almost a year goes by and that at that point it was 2016 I go to
Frank Frank is did you keep all the emails I said printed out every fucking
email I got everything and we don't have a copy of what they recommended or what
they the substantial substantial assistant request we don't have a copy of
that yeah so I file a freedom of information act to get it and but we're
not gonna get it in time for the one-year time bar I'm assume saying one a
year time bar we were gonna argue equitable tolling again so we've put
another 2255 in put another 2255 in government comes back and says he's
time barred Jesus and on top of that they say we don't know what he's talking
about what they say this is common they go we your honor we now but they said
but now that we've heard about this we'll look into it but either way your
honor he's time barred so now the judge has to rule on whether I'm time barred
on so then we send in the letter from the US attorney where he says I'll
consider it blah blah blah the name of the guy everything and we send in the
arrest the newspaper articles we send it to the judge so the judge now knows he's
lying but the judge comes back and says yeah but I think I don't feel like I
have jurisdiction because I think you are time barred however you can appeal it
and I'm gonna wave your certificate off there's a certificate that you have to
file for everything so I'm waving all that you can directly appeal so fine we
then go ahead and we appeal so what the government does our whole appeal is they
didn't file anything for me they promised and they didn't and I did
everything I'm supposed to do more or so I need a sentence reduction so the
government comes forward and they sent they file for a one-level reduction which
would have been like it's like 21 months right nothing right so they file for a
one-level reduction we get it and Frank immediately has some guy type up a thing
saying we don't want the reduction freeze the reduction we're asking for an
evidentiary or hearing we want to go back and present all evidence in front of
the judge please don't rule on this one level we file that the judge comes back
and says I'm not gonna rule on the but he now keep my he because they file the
that it gives him jurisdiction I'm over the time bar so no more time bar they
fucked up when they filed that now it's just a matter of how much am I gonna get
is it gonna be 21 months or 23 months whatever it was or is it gonna be however
much so end up anyway what ends up happening is they give me another lawyer
the lawyer flies down she comes she sits down with me and she says I read your
thing she said and I don't really talk to a couple other lawyers on the street by
the way by this point to told them about what happened last time they said yeah
that doesn't matter you don't have a prayer she comes down same thing hey
listen she is it's well-written you did a good job I mean you know you're not a
lawyer but she did a good job but you just don't have an argument here I said
well I didn't write that Frank did she was Frank or your Frank Amadeo and I
explained Frank Amadeo disbarred lawyer things gonna take over the world blah
blah blah she is you had a crazy person right your thing I said yeah she is okay
we you don't have a prayer I said yet they they've already filed the reduction
they said no before hmm he filed the paperwork he got me a reduction she's
yeah but you're gonna lose at the appeal at the appellate level I said am I
because I said if they really believe that and that was a guarantee I said why
did they give me the reduction why did they assign you she goes yeah I mean I
don't know I just can't imagine this I said look you do understand they can't
let me win if I win it becomes precedent and everybody will fight what
will be filing right it'll get around the time bar and she's like she's sitting
there and she says I probably get you two levels okay I okay well Frank said
that to tell you I want four levels and she goes Frank said I go yeah she is the
guy that the emperor of the world I said the emperor and we used to call them
emperor too by the way yeah and by the way at this point I'm actually writing a
story so when this is happening I'm writing a story I think I'd written his
story I was in the middle of writing a story okay the middle of writing a story
so I mean keep in mind I've got FBI documents that say he's got these fucking
secret service agents working for him he's got he's got a hundred and some odd
companies he's you know he's just insane this that's kind of stuff you get I mean
this is the judge talking about how he wants to take over the world I mean this
is not bullshit this is I got the fucking transcripts new US attorney talking
about it wow it's insane I got I've got the the doctors who have interviewed him
who were saying no no he's bipolar and he's got features of schizophrenia he
really believes he hears voices and he does so I said no Frank said four levels
to tell you four levels she's Frank said the crazy guy said yes Frank said four
levels she says okay well I will see what I can do I said okay nice meeting you
she flies back to Atlanta talked to her whatever a month or two later she comes
back she says look they'll do two levels I said no Frank said four levels she's
they're not gonna do four levels I said you go ahead I said you tell them I said
you tell them we want the evidentiary hearing and I want because now now that
it's open to an evidentiary hearing I'm allowed to present evidence I'm
literally allowed to present evidence well I said I want to present evidence I
want to talk to the two secret service agents in Nashville I want to talk to the
four FBI agents on my case in Tampa I want to talk to the US attorney I want
to subpoena these people I said I want to all of my discovery in my original case
and this case I want all the discovery in the Wilson case she goes she's what do
you want to do turn this into a circus and I go that's exactly what I want to
do we're turning it into a circus I said I'm gonna drive this into the ground
you understand I said I'm gonna make sure they spend as much money and it's as
much of a pain in the ass as possible I said that's what I'm gonna do so I said
that's what you tell me she goes oh my god so she goes back and we go back and
forth back and forth they say no they say boom okay two you two years to two
two two levels blah blah blah finally she comes back she goes oh my god call me
I said okay I said what's up she goes the government agreed to give you three
levels so I told them that to just go ahead and we're gonna go ahead and have
the evidentiary hearing so they're gonna they're gonna move you back I don't take
the three levels she's what what do you mean you said four levels you said you
wouldn't take anything less than four levels and no no no I said Frank said
to tell you four levels I we were always good with three levels right I just
wanted you to argue for four no way I knew I'd end up with three right exactly
I'm happy with three so do not move me I do not want an evidentiary hearing I do
not want to go back to court keep me here and just follow paperwork so they
follow paperwork and boom they give me three levels which ends up being five
years off my sentence wow so now I've got seven and five that's 12 years off my
sentence plus the gain time my sentence essentially is like cut in half with the
gain time it's it's literally I should have done 23 years you know I got 12
years knocked off I ended up doing 12 and a half years because I got some some
halfway house so and I'm still writing stories wow so they immediately try by
the way now I've only got like a year and a half left to maybe two year maybe
a year and a half left so they want like probably about two years left they want
they try and move me to a camp well my mom comes to see me every two weeks she
lives in Tampa she the closest camp is like Miami or Pensacola she can't come
to every two weeks to see me in Pensacola you know she's she's almost 90
at that point she's like 88 years old she's so I can't get moved so I
immediately get myself placed into the drug program I said I got a drug problem
it's an issue I need to go to the drug program no no in Coleman oh okay so I
go to the drug program in Coleman and that way they put a hold on you so they
can't move you from the institution so I get moved in the drug program I have to
pretend to be a drug addict for about four months and take all these classes
it's a nine month course then they put what's called a management variable on
you and they keep you in the prison so as soon as they put that on me I drop out
of the drug program about three months go by and they come back and they go hey
we're gonna take that off you and ship you to a camp I said you I thought it was
good for a year they do typically it is but we really need to move you to a
camp and I said no I can't I got to go back to the drug program why I said I
really have an issue I really have a problem I just realized it coming back
here they go okay cock so I go back to drug person it is ridiculous oh and so
I that's to keep me there so I end up staying there and then I go to the
halfway house I get to the halfway house and so when I get to the halfway
house I'm immediately in the middle of this lawsuit I end up publishing a book
which lawsuit the Warner Brothers the Warner Brothers Deverelli war dogs
okay lawsuit I end up talking to this crazy lawyer I eventually I called like
20 or 30 lawyers none of them wanted to take the case because they all want money
because an intellectual property theft is a it's a long dragged out process and
they'll take it on contingency I finally get a lawyer they'll take it on
contingency so it was it was a so I was in the halfway house while I'm in the
halfway house I my buddy Trian who owns a gym cultist 24-7 fitness he owns a
gym he hires me while I'm in the halfway house so I'm working for him while I'm
working for him one day we I get in the in his car and he's like and he goes he
said because I'm in real estate you know I was in real estate he was you gotta
listen if you listen to this concrete podcast you and he starts telling me
about he's and he's listening to the podcast really yeah in the Jeep it's
got like a Jeep it's all jacked up it's like 80 grand or something and so I get
in things like yeah yeah yeah so then we start I start watching it and whatever
and he used to live in like Pebble Beach or Indian Rocks be whatever Indian
Rocks Indian Rocks used to live there I guess he had seen Ben one time yeah
there's a lot of real that was the biggest thing on this channel was real
estate right series so he ended up watching it at that point and then he
so he was telling me about it and he goes you ought to contact this guy Danny
and I go why I said he's not he's I said for real estate and he goes yeah and I
go trim he's not gonna talk to me about real estate I just fucking did 12 and a
half years for real estate for mortgage fraud they don't want to talk about that
that's a horrible idea and he's right yeah but he's a what about the the
stories the true crime stories you could probably do some stuff with true crime or
something I went well I want to try and do something I'll call them so yeah
that's what that's when I called you and said hey listen I don't know because I

around that probably six months ago probably two or three months in into I

you're telling me that you would get out of the halfway house in July and that was
like two months away so okay yeah so now I've got
about to put it on another book which we're supposed to you know we I've got
the one book out devil expose yep I just got that in the mail actually ordered on
Amazon and I can't fucking highlight it and press speak unfortunately but I'm
gonna have to read this one yeah I just got it yesterday in the mail yeah you
got to read that one I'm reading it for sure so yes so that's gonna be the next
podcast yeah we got to do that it's I'm telling you it's amazing it's it's
really it's a it's a plus you know you get it you'll get a ton of these right
wing you'll get left what synopsis what's the what's the quick elevator pitch
for devil exposed it's there's a guy in prison named Walter Rossini that was a
admitted drug trafficker and he made methamphetamine and ice which you know
ice is just a pure form of methamphetamine he was a young kid 22 23
years old I mean they're making a ton of this is like 20 years ago in LA so in
Hollywood in LA I mean he's like partying with like Aerosmith and you
know they're these these are the guys they're hanging out with and they're
making ice and they're and tons of money anyway he ends up there's a ends up the
short version is he ends up there's a couple dirty agents one of them is an
informant who pretends to be an FBI agent so a couple of dirty FBI agents that
they're paying off for information and eventually what happens is like I'm
literally like like guys are getting arrested they're getting them out of it
guys are getting indicted they're getting them out of it I mean he gets
arrested they stay come in and they make a phone call the cops let them out I
mean that's it's that blatant he's paying these guys then it's like a
couple million dollars they end up paying these guys they want there's in a
sealed indictment they want to know everybody that's on it he tells them
he called boom next day here's who's on it wow I mean he's you know you've got
the end guys are getting caught with nine pounds of ice they get the whole
thing quashed and cut loose what happens is eventually it's convoluted but
basically the short version a streamlined version is two two informants
end up getting murdered and the the two guys that commit the murders initially
when they get grabbed they say that Roussini told Roussini is the one that
murdered them then there's like four guys four or five guys end up getting
grabbed and all four more saying Roussini said it Roussini murdered him well
then they start failing polygraph exams and then they end up saying okay okay I
did kill him I killed him but Roussini helped move the body and Roussini is
the one that told us to do it yeah so Roussini saying that's not what happened
well later it comes out that after the murders the FBI informant comes in and
tells them if anything happens you guys get caught see the FBI is the one that
suggested that these two that this guy one of the guys needs to be killed
because he's an informant he's gonna cooperate he's gonna cooperate against
the two dirty the FBI agent right so we get in trouble you guys are all getting
life sentences so something's got to happen somebody needs to take care of
them so he ends up getting one of the guys ends up getting whacked because of
that now did the government says they got whacked they got killed because they
were both informants is actually not true but they both end up getting killed
it's because of the FBI and the FBI informant that told them to do it then
when they get caught they all say they can't say the FBI is the one that did
it they say Roussini did it then when they say okay we they fail the polygraph
exams okay he didn't kill him I did kill him but he told me to say to kill him
they're looking for somebody to blame they can't say the FBI ordered it right
so what ends up happening is is there's actually proof of a meeting where the
FBI informant gets like seven or eight guys together the same guys that all
say Roussini did it gets them all together and tells them that they all
have to blame Roussini say he did it don't say we did it there's actually
proof that there was this meeting everybody nobody disagrees that there
was a meeting okay so they end up Roussini ends up getting indicted he ends up
he's supposed to get the death penalty and what happens is the US attorney at
the time comes in and says listen I'm gonna let you plead out to 40 years and
you can cooperate against these other guys well the US attorney was Robert
Mahler Robert Mahler is the guy that's investigating the president of the United
States right where it wasn't okay he this was when he was US attorney in San
Francisco so he says I'm gonna let you cooperate against these two dirty FBI
agents and I'm gonna let you cooperate against the other guys so we're gonna
give you 40 years and you know you get your sentence reduced and remember I
said there's only one time I've ever seen an ironclad an actual agreement where
they agree 100% to cut the guy's sentence yeah the beginning of the podcast
Robert Mahler is the one that gave that document to Walter Roussini no fucking
way it's a matter of fact I've got it on the website not my website I've got it
on another on a devil exposed it's called devilexposedexhibits.com it's on
the website the actual document from Robert Mahler so he gives it to him he
goes to Leavenworth meets with them like three times in a row two days in a
row three days in a row like you're three days total I think two or three
days so he meets with him writes all these notes up and everything he and
another FBI agent then gives Roussini 40 he's got the 40 years during the course
of this Mahler realizes Roussini didn't do it that Roussini didn't order the
documents it's the dirty FBI agents he writes down dirty FBI I like I mean the
FBI agent right dirty FBI agents payoffs 200,000 100,000 a year 15,000 here
1.5 million dollars here what starts writing it's all written down in their
notes right yeah so what ends up happening is he says I'm gonna bring you
back to the front of a grand jury I'm gonna we're gonna do this we're gonna do
that well what happens is he ends up becoming getting appointed to the FBI
direct as an FBI director right he was a U.S. Attorney then Bush wins the
election makes him FBI director he goes in front of Congress he's now Robert
Mahler becomes the FBI director okay the U.S. Attorney that takes over the
thing says he's not going to honor the agreement he's not gonna reduce the
sentence he is a matter of fact there is no agreement so Roussini comes up with
a paperwork says what about this this is the agreement and the judge goes yeah
he's got an agreement it's iron-clad you've got to reduce his sentence from
Mueller right got to reduce the sentence so they they go they have a thing they
have a they have a court whatever proceeding yeah and they bring them
back and they reduce the sentence and they reduce it by barely nothing a
couple years then and they completely say they bullshit it this isn't what
happened he's lying he's this he has no proof he has no this there were no dirty
FBI agents it's all a lie it's not true he barely gets any time knocked off so
finally he gets Mueller he gets Mueller drags for like 10 years he drags he can't
go to court because cuz 9-11 happened you know then there's a DC sniper then
there's a anthrax you know he's always come out with these reasons why he can't
be deposed he can't show up at court so it just drags on and on eventually he
has to go back in front of court when he goes in front of the court he says
Mueller gets up and Roussini and his lawyer think that Mueller is gonna say
yes there were dirty agents yes we talked about it yes yes yes Mueller gets
on the stand says it no I don't recall any dirty agents I don't remember any of
that they what did he deny ordering the murders no as a matter of fact he
implicated himself he admitted that he had took part in it wow holy shit I got
the fucking transcripts and everything well what happens is in the meantime he
says all this gets off the stand in the meantime no no sorry he says all this by
this point Pete Roussini's lawyer has come out has found the notes he gets a
hold of the real FBI notes and goes to Mueller and starts saying are you saying
that you never heard about dirty agents and he starts saying on note 004 right
here it says dirty FBI agents right off and he's like I don't recall I'm not
sure why it says that what about here here it says that he denied ordering the
murder I do not it doesn't say he admitted says he denied he they start
really hammering him it the last part of the transcripts is nothing but I at this
present time I do not recall precisely what I was thinking at the time I'm
unsure I mean he's just complete bullshit anyway it's so bad that the US attorney
at the time ends up so they sentence resendance Roussini again they knock
three four years off again let's not give too much away okay we're just teasing
them right now yeah sorry anyway it goes on and on it's it's it's it's it's pretty
egregious and it's not like it's politically motivated cuz I'm not like
a yeah not a conservative or liberal or anything I don't care it's just that
there's a sky in prison and I've got all this documentation and it's proof that
it's just insane it's insane and when you see the document you have to
understand the bulk of the documents are sealed okay and this guy's in prison so
how what can he do it's a great story and I don't it's like like I think I
told you this before it's not like I have like I feel like like Mueller's a
scumbag or anything I I feel like he he covered up something because he's
politically motivated other than that you know this guy volunteered for for
Vietnam I mean he's a patriot was the longest running FBI agent FBI director
I mean it's just this one thing yeah you know and it's just a fucked up
