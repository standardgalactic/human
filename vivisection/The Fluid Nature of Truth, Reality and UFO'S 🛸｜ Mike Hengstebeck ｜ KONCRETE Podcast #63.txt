So what are we so what are we you're just a UFO conspiratorial expert would you call
yourself an expert I know more than the regular guy I don't know what point you become an
expert at it you know it's most of it is conjecture yeah yeah you know kind of an educated guess
hey is this real well definitely you definitely dive way deeper into it you have a lot more
knowledge of it than anybody else I know which I like I think it's cool because it's
really interesting well it is it's one of those hobbies you just kind of get involved
with and then all of a sudden you find yourself in a situation like this when you know somebody
asked me a question about Brazil and hey what are the chances there could be a UFO that
crashed here I started I'm sorry I'm sorry Brazil yeah yeah I mean so thanks for coming
on we've had you on before this is your second time hey guys thanks for having me back yeah
absolutely so what are we gonna talk about today well listen I you know I've been always
interested in some of this aerial phenomena we've seen in some of the different events
that take place and kind of always had an interest over the last I don't know 15 or 20 years
looking at all the stories you know we talk about the moon landings being fake or yes
or JFK and I'm always intrigued by the believers and non-believers it's irrelevant really whether
I believe it one way or the other I was always curious as to what the other person thinks
or how did the story get started mm-hmm so about two days ago I had a buddy call me up
and asked me about a crash of a UFO in Brazil and I chuckled that's kind of funny dude he's
like no really man I got this video I'll send to you it's a it's an Instagram and it's something
that's taking place in Brazil but there's been a UFO crash there I'm like well dude if there
was a UFO crash that's that's pretty big information that's pretty big news yeah I haven't heard
a word about it I mean nothing online so in the meantime he sends me the information I view it on
my phone I look at it I'm like well I mean it looks like a good movie yeah like it really looks
like a good movie I'm doing it I mean some has done some great work here and in the meantime
well I have this conversation with with a good buddy of mine I have another friend of mine that
calls me out of the State Department asking me the same thing and he's not he's done nobody
within the State Department he's kind of a secretary but again we share the same common
interest in this aerial phenomena that we see and so he said he asked me the same question about a
crash in Brazil two days ago and I'm like dude I really have it you being serious he's like I'm
being dead serious man something took place in Brazil and we're not sure and I said listen I have
some contacts there now just a real quick back on my background working in the special operations
community approved countries to work with at the State Department that the State Department allowed
us to work with came up on many of my radar and Brazil is one of them the State Department said
hey you can do work with them so we did training and we work with all their special operations guys
across the board on their law enforcement side through the Brazilian Police Department through
their special officer teams called Garra and then they have a unit that's even above that that the
nickname is Bope B O P E and you can look them up on online and if you put a Brazilian police
Bope it'll pull them up and give you a Wikipedia background on them but these are strong groups
these are these are guys that are their fighters they are looking at narco terrorism across the
board a good group of guys highly trained highly specialized so when this event kind of broke
out I actually reached out to a friend of mine that was with the he's the chief of police and
Rio de Janeiro okay so Bope is stands for I can't pronounce that battalio de operaciones
policias especiales so it's military police of Rio de Janeiro yeah correct with all have special
talents and again all counterterrorism the state of Rio has its own military force um it's actually
Brazil and what they do is they break it off and these guys are all would you know in the states
here we have civil rights there they have no civil rights um they can you know you're better
off not to give these guys a hard time is to give an example the guys that moved here from Rio and
they live here now in the states um had to retire here because they weren't safe any longer in Brazil
one of the guys there his last year in killed 11 people in his neighborhood so his wife used to
vacuum the house with a gun on our hip Jesus so these guys were serious I mean they really were
the tip of the tip of the spear when they retired they had to get permission to come here now they
worked for a group here that is kind of spook oriented they're working with the Saudis right
now on several different programs and I've done like I said known these guys for a long time
so when this question got asked about this crash I said well listen I can get an answer to this
right now I sent a message text message to the chief in Rio but I never got a reply back
so I went to a buddy of mine who runs this group and I said hey you guys hear anything about a UFO
crash and he had me on speaker and he goes well I don't know but I got news for you uh I'm not
going to tell you the guy's name but the other guy was sitting in his office because he's sitting in
my office now and just heard you say that and I said so I said listen I know it sounds funny but
have you guys heard of this and he goes no no we haven't heard of it at all and I said can you
do me a favor can you just check it just ask a question that's all I'm asking these guys are in
Brazil that you're talking to these guys are actually now located here in the states they work
here now state side they retired from Brazil okay to the US and you know can you say what department
they were from um they were I'll just say they were with Gaara they were with Gaara Gaara which is a
special option group out of Brazil okay real and again launch force my guys okay really heavily
trained so I had when I started asking the question about this crashed UFO they I could hear him in
the background kind of laughing and snickering everybody thought it was a big joke yeah I said
let's just do me a favor just ask the question quit watching the history channel exactly exactly so
sure enough about 45 minutes later I get a text message from him and goes dude you're not going
to believe this it is real and Bope has the place locked down and I said where at and he goes just
outside of Rio yeah they're not telling us a whole lot but they definitely said it's a crashed alien
vehicle of some sort there's a in the videos that we got there was initially a hole that you
could see through the trees you couldn't see anything behind the on the other side of the hole
but he said you're not going to believe the story that's going to come out of this and I'm like I
can't believe what I'm hearing now with regards to uh the fact that you guys have a crash there and no
one no one knows about so they're fully convincing 100% this a UFO crash 100% 100% Gaara these guys at
the guys from Gaara this is actually coming from Bope this is coming from Bope he couldn't get a
direct answer from Gaara so we called the guys at Bope and Bope told him yeah not only do we
know about it we have a security perimeter and got this place locked down right now yeah there was
some talk there was some Americans had pulled up yet but I think the amazing point of this whole
thing is that no one knows about it and I don't know you know well it's not any mainstream websites
that I found I googled it I looked all over Reddit I looked all over I mean most of the links are on
Twitter there's some stuff on Reddit but dug through it for the most part it's really hard to find
legitimate media sources talking about it there's one vice article there's one vice article I found
this one right here UFO over Maje Brazil spark social media panicking conspiracies it talks a
lot about it and it talks about how like Brazil is kind of like a mecca and like a hub for these
kind of sightings and these UFO encounters and listen for me again I had never really known that
I mean spending time there I did some work out there with some friends of mine and never did we see
you know anything that was slightly unusual and listen who's looking for them with these these
kind of events you know then you've got there's other shows on tv right now you've got skinwalker
ranch that's on right now dealing in extraterrestrial lives and they've in the meantime on this ranch
with these scientists that are now running these tests on the ground and the soil are finding all
these weird anomalies these real high radar microwave energy that are shooting way up they're
actually you know on the show showing you these these huge readings they actually tried to drill
down on the property until they hit something they couldn't drill through anymore and they
actually started suffering like a mini earthquake that was taking place so you know again around
the world these colossal events seem to be taking place we had some more places here in Florida
last week that said over by NASA where they're dealing with space launches by Kennedy Space Center
yeah that they saw almost a hundred different vehicles up they were really really high up
into the atmosphere they couldn't tell how far up but they were all lights and moving all different
directions and everybody's scratching they had trying to figure out what is that and I I said
listen maybe you know the new satellites they have now that the US is using and they put up a I believe
a rocket just a couple of weeks ago that we're going to let these small cube like four by four
satellites up and I said hey listen maybe it's them and he's like well why would you let them go in
such a low orbit try I said listen I again not knowing anything on the aerospace side of it kind
of again looking at that that the anomalies side of it and I said I'm not sure but there's got to
be an answer to it somewhere right that could be a possibility you know so we look at we look at
again the Navy releasing two different video clips of two different Navy officers who picked up
something on their their gun sights on their new F-18 Hornets and what odd thing is there the Navy
let them just come out and post the story and talk about it this is the stuff that the Pentagon
just declassified right the three videos that's exactly what it is yeah and it's happened back
in 2014 and again listening to the pilots talk about this and because the first questions that came
out of the the guy that was actually talking to one of the pilots was well isn't this classified
information he said listen nobody's debriefed me on anything and told me I couldn't talk about this
and it's not so much about the UFOs I want to talk about it's about the safety
that really concerns me more so than anything because he said that the day that we had noticed
these and the day that I picked this one up on my gun sight he goes it looks like a saucer
it's not moving he goes the odd thing about it was we're using a thermal imager on our F-18 Hornets
that sees heat so we're looking for a jet engine a hot spot he goes nowhere in this video on this
vehicle can we find a hot spot actually what we do see is around the vehicle just around the perimeter
of it a real light area which indicates it's very cold there so again trying trying to reverse that
right those imaging those imagery the the imaging systems they have on those jets they can reverse
it to where hot is white or hot is black right correct and the F-18 Hornets right now are the
ones they're using right now where hot is black okay so it shows up better especially in the
evening hours twilight when they're out running operations okay so yeah I was sorry to interrupt
but when I was in New Sumerna and Ponce over the past three days on Thursday morning we were
out surfing probably around 9 a.m. and there was I don't know what kind of jets they were and I'm
not an expert in fighter jets at all but there was some a serious group of jets circling us
um right off of New Sumerna inlet right off of Ponce inlet and this jet was like it was black
and it looked like some sort of stealth jet like I've never seen in person to be one or but the
craziest thing about it was that it was flying and the sound like this sound that was coming from it
was the jet would be here but the sound would be miles behind it wow so you get that technology
so I don't understand the way sound travels and you know how fast those jets are going but that
thing must have been going fast as fuck for the sound to be that far behind it because you'd hear
it and you'd look no it's not where the sound's coming from it's way over there and I'm sure too
that they want it to be like that yeah they've set these things up to make sure that you know when
we start running hard and guys are gonna come outside and say hey listen we're being attacked now
yeah you know where are they yeah but you're another one absolutely and again looking at that technology
you know when you when you talk about technology shifts you look at look at thermal imagers you
look at night vision where did that come from who developed that you know that when you look at the
the night vision there's a real interesting story about it because of the way that they found it
but there are people that will say that hey this was taken from the crash of 1947
in Roswell also and as they reverse engineer some of this stuff some of they don't know what it is
they just we don't know what it is yeah and eventually something happens to where I mean
a printed circuit boards was a big conversation because everything before printed circuit boards
was tubes wires and tubes so I saw a hilarious comment on reddit about when the pentagon
declassified those three videos of the UFOs someone said that it's just the government
trying to prepare humanity for part three of 2020 which is listen which is interesting because
if you take into consideration all the things that are going on UFOs are coming to kill us
and sear the face of the earth strange enough I mean believe it or not even going back about
five or six months ago I got some friends who are really heavy into conspiracies yeah and they
said oh man there's going to be a red flag they're the US government's going to say the aliens are
attacking and there's going to be a red flag and they're going to lock us all down well it didn't
quite go that way it turned into a pandemic yeah we voluntarily locked ourselves down
but at the end of the day the aliens never really showed up or did they and as you watch more shows
you know again like the skinwalker that's on the history channel and dealing on facts this
isn't some sort of mythological story it's events that are taking place and they're actually
there recording it and whatever is going to happen we're going to see on film at some point
yeah there's are some crazy conspiracies about the COVID-19 pandemic I've read some of those that
how they say that I mean they're they seem like such bullshit because it's how could they
say that this is like a dry run to see if people can stay locked down just to hide something else
like I heard something about an asteroid like if there was an asteroid coming they
wouldn't want people to panic they'd want people to stay indoors and and not and try to kind of like
hedge the downside of what could happen if an asteroid actually hit absolutely absolutely
well you know it's funny you even say that going back I don't know I think it was probably four years
ago the the government came out with a program called jade helm and really jade helm jade helm
and it was just odd when they came to me they said hey look we're looking for extras down here in
fort lauderdale it's a military exercise can you come down and be part of it we're looking
absolutely love to great time so we ended up we went down to fort lauderdale got situated
two of the guys were on our and we were kind of like terrorists taking over a building
um and two of the guys were with us were not guys I'd seen before they kind of stuck to themselves
and um I have a couple times tried to warm up to them you know so who are you guys you guys
running the show here you part of this jade helm are you military guys are you scientists who you
and never could really get to that portion of it um and of course the exercise went on that night
and I had heard one of them make reference to jade helm and called it an event rather than a name
and so about um four months after this event this was something that was going on around the
country about four months after the event I heard that jade helm was uh a program that was set up
for there was an asteroid that passed between the moon and the earth it came real close to hitting
us and they were prepping for that um I'm not sure how they were prepping for it or why because
these were all special operations guys they were using um the the uh I think they're called the
black knights uh it's a 160th group it's an army group that's very highly specialized in uh uh
flights of helicopters and and stealth vehicles and um they were the actual pilots of this whole
event that took place but it was after this that we heard about jade helm so could that be something
that was real again you know again absolutely um you know were the uh are the stories factual
you know what's factual what's really true here go back to my story about Brazil no one's heard
about it it's like the greatest secret ever yeah I'm speaking to guys who don't have they don't
have a dog in this fight it's not like they want to keep it from anybody or or try to share it with
anybody right um but the fact that they've got the facility locked down um and that no other media
outlet knows anything about it is just crazy especially today with with uh you know you can
get online put a youtube video in and everybody can see it around the world right but for whatever
reason we're just not getting that information out of brazil now what did you see like what
is the actual video of this thing going that is like is it actually on youtube because from what
I've seen is that it's been scrubbed from twitter like even even reddit some of the reddit threads
that I've been finding the subreddits the moderators have been taking down posts and some of the
the posts on twitter and even there was a hashtag on twitter I think it was like
maja ufo from brazil one of the hashtags just vanished off twitter so for some reason some
of these social media platforms seem to be censoring well it's odd too because well listen
I get I try not to try to wave the flag too hard here but even when I started looking on youtube
trying to find certain events I found a couple events and then all of a sudden I had problems
reconnecting with youtube um on on a connection at my house and all of a sudden I lost all
connectivity it was like my ip something happened to my ip address I could go to the front room
and hook on to that and go back and look at anything I want but as soon as I went back
onto youtube and tried to look at any material there again that's relative to the story yeah
I all of a sudden I would lose my uh couldn't contact the server I don't know I think that
might be something to do with your wi-fi listen again I 100 with you yeah you got to call forest
get him to get a wi-fi extender in that back room I don't know why the government wouldn't
watch you look up stuff uh in one room and not the other like I say man two different two different
networks one was the 5g yeah the other one wasn't and it was using two different routers so
unless I mean could it just been a simple problem yeah I mean are there are there anything like
coincidences like that I mean does somebody really care if I try to figure out if there's a
ufo crash in brazil somebody might hey it's it's one of those interesting moments again that kind
of leads to you know back to the whole conspiracy story and how it gets started now what's up with
the 6.5 magnitude earthquake that happened in area 51 near area 51 the same day I think it was it was
the same day now is that supposed to have any connection you know again no one knows about
the brazil event so how can you connect the two together exactly you know you find out about that
event because it also took place in utah out of the skinwalker ranch they also have is that where
skinwalker ranch is in utah utah it's in utah okay yeah it says 6.5 magnitude earthquake hits
nevada area 51 quake felt from utah to california yeah okay and so you know again there's guys talking
about that the uh the community there the s2 out to area 51 have these underground uh tunnels that
allow them to uh you know go anywhere if i guess five or six hundred miles an hour under the under
the planet um elon musk just got through putting a similar kind of roadway through los vegas underground
i think it was los and he's trying to put it through los angeles right now is that what he's
doing yeah it's called the boring company we're trying to develop underground tunnels for traffic
basically like putting cars on sleds and shooting them through underground and that boring technique
they use is really interesting because if you watch them how they bore through the ground and they
actually take this hard ground and melt it and make it part of the actual encasing of the tunnel
yeah and he also talks about how they're supposed to be because one of the main concerns is earthquakes
because in california it's known for earthquakes sure but the tunnels are i guess lined with some
sort of like flexible membrane where he claims that it's more safe against earthquakes than
driving on a main road hey like i said where's elon musk come from right yeah where's he's
fucking marz so again an interesting guy interesting background comes from an interesting
place yeah and very very smart yeah he's a genius very very smart man and then another part of this
whole brazil this recent ufo crash quote unquote crash in brazil is this thing right here the part
of the map on if you go on google maps and you go to this exact spot people are claiming that
for some reason this part of the map is completely whiteed out and i mean it's like the shape of a
flying saucer in a movie and here's what's funny but why is that part why is it blacked out why is
it whiteed out like that one of the guys actually said that it's a sun glint um but what's interesting
it's a shiny roof it's being reflected but you can see there's kind of a flare no it looks to me
like it was cut out of there somehow like it's been digitally yeah like they cut it out yeah
literally yeah because of the pixelation if it was a sun i mean if it was like a a lens flare or
a reflection from a bright shiny roof or something it would be kind of like those upper edges it would
be like a kind of a blurred edge not a pixelated edge with a shadow around looking like it was cut
literally that's google maps this is google earth right here yeah same thing yeah google earth you
can see more top and that's where they're saying that the crash is at this is exactly where they're
saying the crash was at yeah right in for fragoso and outside of rio yeah right outside of rio yeah
so i don't know the fuck to explain that either well i'll tell you what's kind of funny and if you
look at the shape of that cut and you look at the shape of the one that the pilot in the navy is
chasing they look very similar very similar to that how do we see what the pilot in the navy oh
oh in the video the video in those videos that were released by the pentagon correct okay and it
looks like a kind of like a top but it looks like a ufo a saucer shape but it's got that odd peculiar
something in the middle of it bump yeah that's super strange and is this i don't know if this
has been seen anywhere else on google maps um the lip like this has it they talk about this they talk
about this in great detail but again because they don't really have a whole lot to to look at or to
talk to who was talking about it again this was somebody on youtube okay hold this up mate that
i'll send you the link to it okay um that basically just kind of outlines um what they
think's going on because they actually at some point in the instagram i'm looking at looks like
they launch rockets and you hear them going off in the background um again it's you know
brazil is very militant in their thinking um you know the white house has actually missiles and
buildings around them so if an aircraft tried to crash into it they could knock that thing out of
the sky i don't see why the brazilians wouldn't have something similar to that especially because
we work with the brazilians a lot we trust them they're they're i mean um listen at the end of
the day that we're all on the same team yeah it's kind of fucked up to think that if a UFO actually
crashed in brazil the first thing human beings do is start fucking shooting it i wouldn't put it
past listen with this whole like we are fucking barbarians look at the coronavirus look how many
people are buying into the whole mask thing and i know there's people out there that hate me for
saying that but i'm i got bad news for you all that does is prevent you from giving it doesn't
prevent you from getting it coming through your eyes right right it prevents you from from like
if you cough or you sneeze it keeps particles and whatever germs away from people around you
and again looking at this it was supposed to be 2.2 million people that were going to be killed
and i think we're and i'm i'm sure in looking at some of the information i've seen on the virus
i actually saw where pennsylvania the hospital there had to deduct 200 people that they said
that had died from coronavirus that didn't die so i'm sure there's some skewed numbers out there
i see that some of the hospitals are getting subsidized by the federal government if they
have a lot of coronavirus patients there yeah i read that somewhere too in like mexico that they're
getting paid if they absolutely like high numbers of that well no everyone every hospital is getting
paid if you if you have a death from coronavirus you make it's something to the effect of like
$30,000 versus a regular death is like 8,000 wow so from if someone's sick and a hospital reports
that as a covid they get 30 to like 10 times the amount of money they would have normally
from the government and that's gotta be that's why the numbers are skewed nobody knows nobody
really knows any of these oh 90,000 people have died i'm like listen i don't want you know one
person to die i think when you start going back and looking at it also the large percentage of
these are these retirement facilities so there's currently uh 1.6 million cases in the u.s and
today as of what is today's memorial day the 20 25th and there's 97,600 deaths total so almost
100,000 and like i say i don't want to see anybody die but it certainly isn't 2.2 million people
yeah right you know that came out and again most of the people that are dying are are people who
have had high blood pressure they suffer from all kinds of right well the average age of death
from this is higher than the average age of mortality in the u.s period absolutely absolutely
we were first broke out i went to the cdc and it was i was looking at influenza last year
and it showed 34,000 people died and about 900,000 people were admitted to the hospital right at this
point i think we were just approaching on the on this side of the day with with the virus about
about 30 or 35,000 but at the time we were i'm so listen it's no different than what was taking
place last year and oh by the way if you're not practicing clean hygiene by washing your hands
you shouldn't be doing this a long time yeah well i went to the gym the other day and i laughed
because when i walked inside the guy wanted to take my temperature and i said bob let me ask
you how many times have you had a fever and felt like going to the gym and he goes well i don't
want to get out of my house i said exactly he goes listen it's just we're going through the
the stages we have a lot of elderly people also that under under the sneaker program i think it's
called uh blue sneakers for the elderly what is it silver sneakers and um they are allowed to
you know come into the gym and these are these are much older people and i would probably say
yeah okay that's anybody at that age could be at risk but they shouldn't be in there i wouldn't
say listen again if you don't feel good don't come in right if you feel fine come on down to the
gym and train that's right get back to where it was right right right i mean the problem the problem
is people don't like to follow other people's rules and you know at the end of the day it's
these private businesses if they want to take your temperature or if they want you to wear a mask
they have the right to fucking tell you to do that go to go to another gym if you
don't want to do it i mean people just want to like bitch and complain like it's my constitutional
right to come into your gym or to shop at your store no it's not it's someone's business someone's
private business like i say i mean i get it at the end of the day if you're at risk yeah
everybody needs to keep that in mind yeah for sure but i again at the same time there's something
else that's going on because as these events kind of unfold uh in the bigger picture what is really
going on i mean you know you look at um like i say the skinwalker ranch and how all of a sudden
amazing this place has become and there you know you go to ancient aliens now on the history channel
and they've got every guy in the world on there who's talking about machu pichu and ticapoo and
all the different places in Peru they just found now found some skulls out there that don't have a
Sagittarius line which separates the center of the skull and they initially said that what they do is
um the uh inhabitants of this location and this they're going back probably five to six
thousand years ago would actually do a thing called binding and they would tie the head
so the skull became long and the the professor who was teaching the class was like well why were
they doing that they just didn't do that one day because they woke up and felt like hey we want to
tie our kids heads make them real long like this um he said there were there had there had been
extra terrestrials there that had this elongated skull um and that they found these skulls these
skulls were 40 percent heavier uh 25 percent bigger than a regular skull and had no Sagittarius
line that went down the center of the skull and he really uh he oh oh and he goes it also didn't
have any microchondria DNA because everything on the planet has that and again i'm like well why
isn't this big news where is the awe the shock and awe over these events and these stories i mean
are we so used to it now because we've seen every type of you know sci-fi show on tv from
star trek so nobody believes anything anymore the thing the thing is there's there's scientists out
there and researchers who have had their research sort of established already and when new information
or new discoveries come out these people want to discredit it because their egos are attached to
their discoveries and to what to what is already accepted so if you've devoted your life to one
ideology to one scientific ideology and someone else comes in 20 years later and says no you
guys are missing something then it's sad that their ego kind of gets attached to it and they
just want to like discredit that person or say no that's a pseudo scientist oh yeah and i think i
think that's obviously that's a great point because i see that going on a lot like if you
look at the great sphinx um in egypt and they talk about how old the sphinx is and a geologist
actually came out and said no it's actually much older than that and they said why is that and he
said because what we're looking at was done with water not wind and this was erosion on the
side of the actual sphinx right right and he came down and said well when when it's water erosion
it goes one way and when it's wind erosion it runs actually lateral to the to the to the ground and
he said this isn't this was done by water and so if you took the planet and kind of
reverse wobbled it they could go back almost 10 000 years to when that area was extremely wet
and he believes that's when the sphinx was actually put up it was put up before the egyptians were
there egyptians kind of came into it right after the fact right so same same thing with
mont montu montu pichu and peru absolutely they say that the people there basically came there and
just moved in they didn't create it because there's no possible way humans it would take like 30 000
3 000 humans to carry one of those or i don't know how many people they said it would take
but basically those things are tens 10 tons 20 ton bricks and i thought they came from two mountain
two mountain tops away you know were they trying to convince me they dragged them you know
3000 miles even though you could see the other mountain top they came from but they dragged
them that far when i had other guys say well the you know the egyptians used rope and they used
these logs and i'm like who was making the rope how long was that rope was it really that strong
like you know 3000 men could pull on it and yeah come on man really yeah there's something bigger
going on you look at look at how much they talk today and they really associate the pyramids with
astronauts look at the mayans the mayans had a calendar a 30-day calendar we liked it so much
that we adopted that calendar and the interesting thing is that the mayans accounted for the wobble
that the earth has yeah i mean how do you do that how do you understand there's a wobble when you
don't get off the planet so there's something else that's going on why are there why there are
pyramids there's more pyramids in south america than all of egypt there's about 10 000 pyramids
through south america how did and south america had no contact with egypt how did they know to make
that same type of building right the same design the same design it's you know using i mean whether
this was to generate power or it was to communicate or it was set up as a hey this is the time of year
that we were going to plant wheat you know the summer solstice is here and marks those because
many of the buildings do mark those you know the summer solstice when it's time to plant when it's
not time to wet season and yet everyone wants to take it off at these savages out here that have
these you know bows and arrows and rocks they chipped out of it put these things up well there's
there's there's lots of evidence i mean especially i don't know if you've researched done a lot of
research on graham handcock and randall carlson he got graham handcock wrote a book called finger
prince of the gods where he talks about those lost civilizations that got wiped out and basically
he says there's multiple cataclysmic events that happened throughout the history of the earth
throughout the last six billion years that aren't accounted for in basically modern studies of history
and ice ages that aren't accounted for and basically the basics the basic summary of it
is that there were civilizations just as advanced as us if not more advanced that got wiped out by
crazy ice ages and comets that hit the earth like there's there's a there was a new a new meteorite
location in greenland i think it is where it's like an 18 mile wide comet wow that would have
wiped out the earth and seared the top of the planet and there they also showed there's i mean
they have tons of youtube videos and podcasts that actually detail this so if you're if you're
watching this search graham handcock and randall carlson where they talk about it and they even
show detailed photos of if you go to the beach and it's low tide like right after the water goes
back out near the shore you'll see like those ripples in the sand where you know water was just
there and like current when current rips through an area like in a river you'll see ripples in the
sand basically what they show is in washington when you fly over these great plains in washington
there's these same exact ripples that are miles and miles and miles long where basically he's
what it proves his theory that there was massive you know sea level changes where in one day the
sea levels would rise by 300 400 feet because of these ice caps melting because these comets would
hit earth and basically just create instant an instant climate change that would in one afternoon
basically raise the temperature of the earth by who knows 100 degrees and the whole top of the
of the continent would be on fire and it would put it would add 400 to 300 feet of sea water on top
of whatever was just there earlier that afternoon sure that water rushes in i'm sure is that yeah
blows up and the same thing what you see at the beach with those little ripples in the sand
or in a river mouth those little ripples in the sand underneath the water so it's absolutely
mind-blowing no like i say man there's just there's still so much that we don't know you know even
going out to to uh utah and i've gone out there several times we went out there with the family
one year and found shells you know seashells in a high desert somewhere so you know the water was
up at that point there was even a study here i want to say about five years ago and and they're
always finding uh these mastodon these little baby elephants and whatnot throughout greenland
and they end up finding one one day that where the skin was still on it was still had flesh
and it was it had been frozen and the strange thing was that they you know they've obviously the
the scientists were all excited and they packed this the land on the lap and they bring him back
to the lab and they start looking at him and they found him in a frozen environment
but the interesting thing was that the contents of its stomach were still there and there were
buttercups and he said when this animal was killed he was in a field where there were buttercups
so whatever change happened happened it's a it's a it's just a small plant that they would eat
okay like a grass plant okay and um he said that whatever event took place wherever this
this little baby mastodon elephant was eating um was hit by a wall of ice and covered instantly
so whether it was an an environmental change that happened right now or it was a meteorite
that struck the planet part of that event let's say that took place that hit him but he was in a
warm environment before right when he died and so when you look at there's now scientists that
are looking at those events and going hey listen some of these events were catastrophic they didn't
just didn't happen over time yeah they happened right now and so when you look at those events
like that I could absolutely see that happening yeah this guy Randall Carlson talks about how
during some of these events that icebergs the size of oil tankers would be just sliding
would just be being carried across the continent and those icebergs are full of rock and debris at
the same time so when those things do those things carry lots of rock and lots of big debris and
fragments so when those things melted it explains why all these rocks are now scattered in places
hundred ton stones right never be these hundred ton stones were frozen in these
1000 ton icebergs or something ridiculous I don't know the exact number but these massive
icebergs that were bigger than oil tankers just being sliding across the earth and completely
just melting and powderizing anything in its way and like I say we're still seeing those changes
today you know if you look at how the tides have come up here just in florida um there's areas you
know I grew up here there's areas um where I used to go fishing at down by the shoreline
and today at high tide those areas flood and they didn't flood when I was was a kid so these
these events are definitely happening there's changes going on whether it's you know related
to the sun or to environmental whether we're doing it you know becomes a whole other story
I think they're naturally occurring events that take place you know I watched a program
the other night that talked about alien beings and he said what they they started talking about
giving us um the different types of blood types that we have a positive oh a negative
look at these different blood types and those blood types were given to us so that if they at
any one point in time they didn't like that what was going on with that group of people
they could develop a bug that would after just those that blood type and would kill them off
where'd you watch this so they were talking when they started talking about the the towards you
the big plague the bubonic plague oh okay and they said so when you look at these catastrophic
events throw out history that take mankind out they only take out a certain group and as fast
as they come in they leave again and so he said what he believed was that uh the planet is a living
entity and that uh we're kind of like a bacteria on it and for the last thousands and thousands of
years uh the extraterrestrials have been grooming us and trying to get us to do a certain thing
and every time we wouldn't do that certain thing they would come through and kind of wipe us out
so if you if you go back and look at the history of mankind you think well man the great flood
they talk about in the bible and the bubonic plague and the spanish flu and all these different
events that come through and kill just hundreds and hundreds of millions of people um said we're
we're brought on on purpose by extraterrestrial beings well another thing to consider is there's
as far as like these big cataclysmic events that happen that wipe out civilizations and then
wipe out the face of the earth there's for instance there's this thing called the media or the uh the
torrid meteor stream which is basically this freaking it's this like million mile wide
stream of meteors and comets that the earth actually passes through twice a year okay
i think it's in once in june and once in november and apparently the equivalence of the earth passing
through this stream and not getting hit by a eight mile wide comet is the equivalence of
you putting on a blindfold and walking and running across a six lane highway praying you don't get hit
by a truck my luck's not that good by the way yeah but he was basically claiming that the earth passes
through this thing twice a year and there's a handful of comets in that meteor stream the torrid
meteor stream that are big enough to completely wipe out the face of the earth so it's only a
matter of time before you know before one of those comets hits the earth again and just and
just completely destroys the earth and everything that every living thing now did you see this this
this um meteor that came in through russia i want to say it was three or four years ago was actually
one that came in through garbosk russia and in the process of actually coming down to the ground
something hit it yeah it exploded well what i think what happened was it went the atmosphere
basically burned it up and it's exploded in the air before it hit the ground right well what they
do is they actually show something that actually what's that thing called flies up to it and hits it
and they actually give this thing credit for that thing not hitting the earth well again
listen if this is a living and let's go with this for a second let's just say the planet is a
living entity and when i when i ask one of the guys who's put on the class well let me ask you
this okay let's just say that you're right and that we were given blood types for that reason and
and we're we are a bacteria yeah what's the what's the what's the focus i mean what is our what is
our what are we supposed to do and um he said listen we've done it and we've mastered it and it's
carbon dioxide we now put more carbon dioxide in the history of mankind and he goes if you
he goes i said well why would you say that he said well the reason i say that is because there's
more people on the planet now than ever recorded history right um if they if we weren't doing the
right things he goes they'd get rid of us because that that's not healthy for the planet and so
everything comes back to the planet i said so you don't think these are from other worlds and he's
like oh no they're they've always been right here they're uh again they're primary functions to
make sure that the planet stays healthy and on its game the other side of the coin was too that
you know over millions and millions of years the planet continues to get bigger because as trees grow
and they die and you know the planet actually gets actually larger um it affects the way the
planet spins he got into great detail about how does the planet get larger when you figure as it
trees grow you ever you ever go to a forest and see how thick the the the underling is where all
the leaves are like the mass of the earth the mass of the earth literally gets bigger and it
actually what it does is there's also groups out there that say that like um as an example remember
the uh brontosaurus real long lizard long neck yeah um there are groups that will tell you now
because of the environment here that animal could not live its heart could not push in a blood
throughout its whole body because they were so big um if you look at the pterodactyl you ever see
remember the pterodactyl the bird that kind of flew it was a skin like a lizard he said in order
for those to fly you had to have the right environment he goes they didn't have legs where
they could run and get up off the ground they had like claws and the tips of their wings and they
had these real short legs like they were hanging on to something and would let go and either go
into a right off the bat go into a glide or in enough way they could flap their wings one time
and get up high enough where they could now fly in order to do that you need low pressure
so he believed that the earth had low pressure around it he also believed that dinosaurs lived
at the same time that that man was here and that they kind of coexisted together and that
over time you know as the the atmosphere changed those animals could no longer adapt to it and
they ended up dying off which again well the atmosphere definitely changed when the comet
hit the earth completely definitely blacked out the sky and sure stop things from being able to
live and was that part of that i mean they say listen when you when you go back and you start
looking at some of these people that were in the bible how old they were and you figure out that
moses was what five to seven hundred years old and so when he brought that up i thought well
that's interesting yeah okay why do you think that is because why don't think the sun was cooking
everybody back then so the radiation from the sun now is really what kind of at the end of the day
does us in and he said back then they didn't have that so they live these crazy long lives
like that i mean he also believed that all of the um the gods that they talk about Zeus and all of
the others that follow under him were real and that we we ourselves just like the bible says you
know if you're um god made us in his likeness okay well he said if he made us in his likeness and he
was a god we kind of we strive to be gods too and i said i don't understand that what do you mean by
that he goes listen we want to fly we want to control the weather we want to you know swim
underwater and be able to breathe these are things that gods do and we perfected those we now you know
we can make it as cold as we want the house we can make it as hot as we want the house we control
all the elements so you know you start kind of taking some of this into consideration like well
maybe i mean again it's all part of the theory people have this ideology of where we came from
and what we're doing here and where we're going and the aliens is it all is it all together it's
all really about the earth keeping it healthy at the end of the day and these these beings like i
can say i've always been here project disclosure came out in 2012 they had 44 members project
disclosure project disclosure came out uh i want to say 2012 it was set up with
40 different members who were all these were all real high military personnel these were guys
that work within the federal government for you know different agencies the nsa
um and each one of these guys came out and told a little story this guy calls himself
steven greer his name is steven greer he calls himself a uf ufo oligest uf oligest uf oligest
uf oligest he's actually an emergency room doctor is what he really is oh really he's an emergency
room doctor which makes the story even more so amazing because uh himself this guy in here and
the great guy and listen hey lasar lives here too lasar lives in coral gaples florida does he
really yes he does he lives right here in florida he's an interesting dude oh yes super
interesting again look at element 115 and that's another weird thing i wanted to i don't want to
interrupt but before we get off this topic the bob lasar shit is so weird going back to talking
about the ufo that is hit in brazil how some of that stuff's disappearing off twitter disappearing
off reddit i searched now bob lasar did a podcast with joe rogan which is one of the
joe rogan's biggest podcasts got i mean he's got 11 million views it's definitely top 10 percent
of the podcast as far as like popularity if i go on youtube and i search joe rogan
bob okay it does pop up so this this is you still gotta look it's not shadow ban
maybe that was just me for some reason they were trying to ban me yeah i've been looking
at too much ufo shit there's like dany you we're cutting you off zipped up all right anyways stranger
things happen what were you talking about stranger things happen no but just listen he lives here in
the core gables yeah core gable florida i mean again when you look at element 115 that wasn't
around and all of a sudden it's there um they went to to bob's house about a month ago the fbi did
why would they go there and do that i mean if this guy really wasn't what he said he was
who cares so obviously something was going on he obviously struck a nerve with somebody
and what he was talking about with this element 115 why don't you think i mean i when you watch his
interview all of his interviews and all of his podcasts i mean it's it's almost it's really
hard not to believe what he's talking about why would this guy be a lot i mean he would have to have
spent a lot of time fabricating these stories and and all the details in them well i think too when
people started to go back and kind of do an investigation because listen nobody wants to
take anybody at face value you know like this is a pretty big story and you're like you're part of
this really yeah you really worked at s2 s s4 well yeah but s2 is where this the extraterrestrial
vehicles were actually at okay s2 oh okay so he initially when he came out wanted just to share
the information that with everyone and obviously you know the powers to be did want to do that
so they discredited him and they um when the um i'm trying to think i believe the
reporter's name was nap daryl nap was the investigating reporter so what he did was
went back to the university and asked for his university record oh yeah because they wiped
his university records and that was and so it what it did was it made people kind of like me
oh i'll see you there lasari you weren't telling the truth to begin with now they can't find a
thing on you and it's kind of oh really the government did all this and like i say when
you go back now all this time has gone on all he was discredited for so many things
um like i say you go look at the periodic chart element 115 is now on there
he talked about that element and whatever else he had done and had recorded they obviously
thought that he had more information there because they went to his house right um and bob's not a
bob's not a um a troublemaker he's not a you know this guy has a phd he's a highly educated man
who uh thought that the truth should come out about hey listen the american public can handle it
well i think they can and i'm going to come out and let everybody know that wants to know what's
going on and i think when you when you take that into consideration what he's done for ufo's
across the board help us better understand what we're seeing why they don't want to share this
with us whether we can handle it or not um you know listen i'm real far from that's that category
but when you talk to younger people today especially the millennials why are you far from
that category personally why do you think you're far from that category um i tend to i try to try
to be the moderate i try to be the guy in the middle yeah i want to understand you know again
why is it that some people think that religion is real or why is it you think ufo's are real or
why did you think kennedy was shot by this group or why did you think that well it's fun to dive into
all these conspiracy theory wormholes on the internet it's really fun and it's really entertaining
to do it but if if you're somebody who's really looking for the truth or is not gonna just tie
yourself to some idea and try to prove tell everyone that you're right and they're wrong
if you really believe something you should be i mean this is something we talked about with
nathan croc basically if you think something's real you should be always trying to go out there
and prove it wrong find things that that go against it absolutely if you really want to
believe something to be true don't just look for things that are going to confirm your beliefs
search for the things that are going to prove you wrong sure and listen even with you know
we talk about these things and what event in your life that happens or takes place
and i'll give you another story live near the beach here again dealing with night vision
we just got some new night vision in and so i had never used to before and i was getting ready
to go over to socom so i wanted to know where do you get this stuff from it just comes in from
the manufacturers okay there's there's a manufacturer just does nothing but night vision okay i are so
we go right to those guys and there's units there are about three grand you know when you start
buying them all right so most people won't go out and buy them right but as we put these special
operations teams together and i get the equipment and bring it in just to kind of get to use it so
i went in the backyard and i'm laying on my deck and i'm playing with it and there's a thing called
that they talked about when i even with the the inventor called flaring and so i'm laying on the
back and i'm doing this well out of the east come these two balls of light and i'm looking i pull
the night vision away from my eyes i'm looking at the night vision i go i wonder if that's a flare
that's called a flare or what's going on so i put it back up in my face real quick again
and these two balls of light that had come out of the east are still there i have two real
tall palm trees on the side of my house they're probably 60 feet high and these lights went around
those trees i mean i instantly jumped up and knew i was looking at something without the night
vision on you couldn't see them yeah so you know what does it take to prove something like that to
yourself i don't i didn't run out and grab the newspaper go oh my god i saw these balls of light
you're not going to believe this um these events were i don't have that a personal matter but i think
if you you know we share well some people are looking at you like uh oh i think one of the cuckoo
has got out of the loony bed absolutely you know so yeah so you know sometimes you don't you base
an opinion or a fact based on hey this is what i've learned through my years of seeing these things
or something like it and um well i think i think the the best part about it about what you're doing
whatever whatever if you want to call yourself a conspiracy guy or you know a guy who's into all
these cuckoo conspiracy theories i mean look at it from the point that at least you're interested
you know you're interested in it you're fascinated by it sure and you're looking into it and you're
curious to what it is people just want to push it away be like i don't even want to think about
that oh yeah because that's labels me as a cuckoo bird and listen i'll tell you it kind of it kind
of for me it's like reading a good novel yeah you know how did you get there what made you think
this what gave you that ideology behind that and listen i'll even take it with religion
i find religion very interesting when you start looking at the belief factors of of certain people
or certain groups um and how strong their religion is or their background or what their beliefs are
and listen it's it's a belief it's not based on any fact you know it's just a belief process so
you know when you start looking at this and the people who don't believe in it are i mean listen
i believe president trump said that he has no doesn't care about him one way or the other
just doesn't care i find that hard to believe about religion about ufo's about ufo's he just
didn't care about ufo's it just wasn't important um you know listen there's some that say john f
kennedy was killed because he was trying to expose ufo's and aliens and that they weren't just going
to let that out that that kitty out of the bag yeah so you know again that when you if i look for
enough information i can actually find stories that support that theory and there's a group of
people out there i'm sure they would be absolutely willing to die over oh i know that's why kennedy
was killed yeah of course so but what makes them think that way you know this story coming out of
brazil um you know how do you keep something like that tied down so well and you would you
know you really don't think about it i think what i mean when i first heard it was kind of ridiculous
when did you first hear about it uh two days ago two days ago two days ago that's when they're
saying it happened it happened the day actually so three days probably almost three days ago but
it's sometime i think it happened last wednesday right yeah exactly okay and so you know when i
called up the guys to ask them that question it wasn't what am i hey man i got something really
cool to ask you about a gun or about some sort of thermal imager or night vision or you know whatever
it was about ufo's and i could hear the guys kind of chuckling in the back so it's funny you know
when you don't really take into consideration that it's real um i mean listen i have when you talk to
people who see bigfoot um i mean dude these are people who not only tell you a story but look
have fear in their eyes yeah um i talked to a cat here in florida who was up in the panhandle
in a little area called torea state park it's probably one of the coolest parks in the state
you know it's it's like going to the north carolina but you only have to go five hours to get there
you got little streams and running water and you know 80 foot bluffs and great hiking trails just a
beautiful place yeah and um he saw an eight foot actually recorded it with a thermal imager
um and took a video of it as it stepped between two trees um one of these bigfoot organizations
got a hold of the information that's how i ended up seeing it on youtube and um uh went back and
looked at the same tree where this guy was said this animal was and when this animal was standing
behind the tree one of the first things you can notice is you can see his shoulders on each side
of the tree when they put this guy that was six foot four in front of the tree you could only see
his shoulder if he popped one side out on one side of the tree or the other um when he took
these steps out to walk away um it took about two steps for this animal to be completely out of the
picture and it took him like five steps to get out of the picture so you know listen nothing's big
it was huge he said was over eight feet you know we start chuckling listen i used to go camping out
there and backpacking and i've never seen anything but yet he's got it on video um not only that this
guy was scared when he was telling the story i'm not going back out there again i know there's
animals out there now that yeah you know are much bigger than me and i'm not you know he goes if i
had shot this thing i'd just made him mad yeah so you know again you look at the kind of individual
where do these stories come from or listen are we headed for some new point in man's existence now
that something's going to be revealed to us you guys lockdown all these weird things are going on
around the on the planet um what's really going on yeah you know you look at the pandemic when
you start talking about how we ended up where we're at here today this brazilian thing oh and
did i tell you too by the way this is kind of odd president trump put on a travel ban today to brazil
oh yeah you did mention that you read that too i was talking about that yeah i saw that today
is there really a fucking i gotta look that up so is that weird i mean again so is it just
is it a coincidence is just kind of one of those weird moments that you're like wow dude
check this out um it all it does is fan the fire right you know and the people who are die-hards
you know now let me tell you this is why right ap associated press white house imposes coronavirus
travel ban up to brazil on brazil which is crazy wow and again you know again is that just a
weird set of circumstances because listen everybody that's in the video that's talking
about this thing the crash here is wearing a mask yeah so you know there's there's some legitimacy
there but again what why brazil all of a sudden why did they get picked out that's freaky of all
the places right now with that coming up right and it's funny they just now decided to do that
literally 12 hours ago i think because if you look at the one the message came out was 12 or 13
hours ago so three days after this supposed ufo crashed in brazil the u.s decides to put a travel
ban in place you're not going so again it's just that raises my blood pressure just a little bit
but you know it's just those little events like that that take place that you'll make you go wait
a minute really yeah come on man i didn't listen when i first got go all the way back to the first
guy that asked me the question hey did something crash in brazil no dude who crashes in brazil i mean
come on their aerospace program do they have an aerospace program no they don't why would anybody
be interested in what they do right so like i say that when i first came to me i kind of joked
about it then when the other guy called me up and asked me and he wasn't doing it from but hey man
and who is the other guy just my buddy over at the state department the state department okay his
name is terry brandis okay i can say his name it's not a big deal okay like i say he's not a spook
he doesn't do anything okay important um super nice guy but just interested in this as i am yeah
from a from a hey wow check this out and so he called me up with it and because this guy's got a
little bit more of a background um and he's you know again start telling me hey i just i'm asking
because it's some i heard some hoopla about it yeah like well what the hell you're at the state
department who cares about right well i mean listen if it's a real ufo we have a lot to say about it
so start to peel the layers of the onion back hey let me just ask somebody i call my buddies up you
know we're having a five listen these guys aren't predestined we i've never even had a ufo conversation
with him about this okay so it's not part of again who we are we're all um dealing in weapon
platforms and guns and explosives and yeah that's very very cool and you know we all love that these
guys are all knuckle draggers they're the some of the best warriors in the world this was the last
thing that anybody thought i was going to call him ask him about which kind of brings more validity
to the story because then he goes back and he just doesn't ask his team with engara he goes back to
bop and not only does bop know about it they got a perimeter set up around this place and everything's
locked down like well wait a minute and bop is communicating back to him basically just admitting
to him yeah a ufo landed he's one of them he was a commander with engara so these guys it's like
everything else listen if you were if you're part of the end if you're part of the no then you're part
of the no um i don't mind sharing tactics with you on how to assault an airplane if i know we're on
the same team if we're not on the same team right um you're never going to know i know i know i know
how to an assault a plane yeah so this is kind of that same format dealing with guys who are like
minded um again these guys these guys did it for 25 one guy was 25 years the other guy was 29 years
with gara so they know all the top guys with bop and bop all these guys um it's you know when they
went there just to give an example and to make you understand what civil rights were all about
i had trained a bunch of them here on uh it's called a 40 mic mic they're these little um
they shoot wooden batons and they're basically for crowd control and so they're i'm showing there's
we got about a hundred guys here that i'm instructing they're going to go back and show
98 000 guys how to use these wow so and they're getting ready to have the um what's the big
soccer game they have every year uh the world cup the world cup was taking place in brazil
and they were getting ready to train all their guys up so they came over here and oh yeah those
fuckers get crazy during the world cup oh dude they get real crazy well they were mad too because
they were spending all this money on the world cup and the people believed that money goes to us
it should be coming back here to the states not being used for this world cup event that's coming
back we put all these millions and millions of dollars out here so they were mad and what they
do is they set up three rings of security to make sure they keep the tourists that are there
to see the games safe and um so they go through this whole process get it set up well i'm showing
these guys how to use these the wooden batons and what you're supposed to do is kind of shoot the
ground and you skip them off and they hit you across the shins and they make you change your
mind of wanting to come over and riot now right well what they would do was they would actually
shoot the guys like in the ribs and on the face and kill them and drag their bodies off and i'm
like dude what are you doing he's like hey this is not america you don't have civil rights here
we tell you to get out of here you don't get out of here whatever happens to you happens to you and
you're on your own damn so and that's the way it goes so gara is that first group and then
bobe is above them with regards to if the bobe's coming to get you if bobe rolls in it's going
to be a bad day they're not there to talk anybody out of the building they're probably going to level
the building with you in it so you know again taking into consideration that's really what we
talk about um dude these guys were blown away the fact how do you know in the us that we've
got an event taking place here in bokeh and we don't know that and i said listen i got lucky
because it was just a kind of a queer coincidence of how we ended up here but to for you guys to
confirm it i said has anybody released any information because we i'm not finding any
more other than hey man we got something here it went down the night before we have a security
perimeter set up um you know i'm sure that i mean the first thing i would think about is radio
activity so i'm obviously don't want to run into any place that's going to be you know hot and be
like oh how did hanks defect i yeah so but again i it's to me it's one of these events that take
place that can't be ignored you think we'll hear more news about it or i would say we would almost
have to it's somebody is going to pull the plug on this and want to be the first guy to talk about
this is the video right there so is this the right video this is this is the video of the
lights over brazil the lights apparent the crash right yeah uh now like i say there's several
different ones there's a bunch of different i i think i sent you that i should send them to your
phone yeah you did and um all right now this looks like this is the video that's in embedded in the
vice article okay now see that the other one shows these red lights there's it's just very
bizarre i told you it looks like a movie yeah um it's really hang on here it's really strange with
regards to the actual yeah the thing is i don't know if you can just trust some random meme page on
instagram i'll i'll pull up that video real quick well and listen i think too and i forgot to even
bring up do you remember that day this is the video you sent me right here there it is right there
that's the one right there now i haven't seen this video anywhere else now the police are
going crazy you can see everything that's going on there's i know there's no sound on this is
sideline culture on instagram so again even if you say okay that's not a ufo all right fine
what are you looking at what is this what are those lights on the sky are those drones so this
looks similar to what was on the vice article this part right here that first thing with that
thinks that big like hula hoop looking thing i haven't seen that anywhere else no i mean even
just like i say this is obviously this is definitely in in brazil i mean they're speaking portuguese
yeah i don't understand what they're saying um i actually probably need to go down and talk to
the guys that are here and what are they saying are they saying look at that thing in the sky look
at that thing in the sky yeah the other one i had actually shows them watching rockets off
and the rockets are going off yeah you can hear explosions going off yeah they it's a defensive
defensive measure but you're like well what are the brazilians who they're war with what are they
shooting these things off for so then it gets it this is the clip that shows the part of the map
that's whiteed out or cut out so and like i say it's compelling it's just very compelling and you
know you start looking again you take these little events here take that event there and all the
sudden they end up somewhere like this and can you imagine what'll happen if there's actually
a vehicle here that's crashed and they come out to the world say hey listen we actually got it no
by the way here's the bodies you think they would actually do that though i don't think so no i don't
think so um but at the same token you know you kind of get caught with your pants down like oh
hey what are you doing there with your pants down yeah well i'm not doing anything well it
looks to me like you are yeah and so when you take into consideration you know again this is
kind of a third world country they really don't right you know i mean poor people live in shacks
on the side of hills and poor people here in this country have homes they live in these if they are
like some sort of hypothetically extraterrestrial beings and they flew a ship from billions of light
years away and then as soon as we get here we start shooting rockets at the ship i mean that's
got to be the equivalent of us flying to some remote jungle in africa and having a bunch of
monkeys throw rocks at us oh listen if you go in and look at uh i want to say it's in uh los angeles
1940-ish there's an event that takes place there where they actually shoot 1400 rounds
at this thing up in the sky oh my people were actually killed on the ground because of the
shrapnel that came down hit on the ground the people's homes were hit um this was during the
japanese war and so they they assumed that this was the japanese that were coming here
but they shot this thing there's lights on it they shot it for i don't know well over an hour
i never dropped it so you know it's called i want to say it's called the attack in la or
i can't think of the name of it now but it was a real event that took place over la um where they
actually shot what year i want to say during this was during the japanese war because they thought
these were japanese okay and they never knew what it was never knew what it was never came out and
said they got videos you know pictures of it they put every every um they had these positions
that were set up with all these different lights so that if you came in as a bomber they could
put the lights on you you know at night you could see where the guy was the bombers fly real high
and they fly real slow and so they would use these big lights well they've got every light turned on
on this thing and it's lit up you can see something in the center but no one's willing to say it's a
ufo they're not willing to say it's a spacecraft of any sort um they just keep acting like well
we really don't know what it is i'm like well if you shot at it for an hour and did knock it out
of the sky and it disappeared later i would say it's probably an extraterrestrial vehicle of
some sort that's obviously not from this planet because we've been not being able to shoot it down
like that but i think we're we're just a war in community anyway i think we were again if you go
back and look at the gods if you look at the greeks and how they wrestled everything was based on
your physical strength and making being a better person um you know is that alive and well today
sure it is i mean look at football look at hockey look at the strongman contest um look at what men
do to be men today politics it's all about power yeah you know about power so and how do you how
do you emulate that power what do you like about it some people like it because they it's money
other guys like it because it's a position of authority um you know you put those two together
especially if um whatever technologies you could get from a ufo you would want to be able to use
to your best military right you know yes that's another thing bob lasar talked about was that in
like an area s4 where they were studying like the propulsion of these spacecraft and how they worked
you know they kept everything part compartmentalized every different person that was working on a
different part of one of those crafts they kept all that information compartmentalized within
those people they didn't tell them anything extra that they didn't know your deal was this little
widget that's all you did was that one little and you had no idea what else was connected to this
widget right and he mentions that they had there was hangers adjacent hangers next to him like
lined up with different craft in them they didn't even let them go look at different different
spacecraft um and one of the things he talks about is that they don't want this getting out mainly
because they don't want another country to learn about it and try to use it like to weaponize it
against other countries sure it all comes back to people just fighting each other for power and
dominance and absolutely look at look at space force space force has just been united here in the
u.s. they actually just started drafting people and drafting people but taking volunteers into
space force i heard stories four or five years ago that's the the programs that reagan put on
back in the early eighties which were supposed to be the system that was set up there to knock
out uh other nuclear devices that were launched at you through space and um instead these guys
were dropping titanium rods out of vehicles that were up in space and um when you take a titanium
rod and you drop it through space and it comes at supersonic speed the damage that it does there's
no explosion there's no explosion it looks like somebody under the earth pushed up a big breath
of air yeah um but it's unbelievable so if you go back to the eighties and we were doing that and
i still think they're doing that today when you look at a lot of these uh flights that are coming
now up out of nasa with these new rockets are launching up i think they're sending up titanium
rods and i think they keep these things fed they can send these things anywhere within 30 minutes
we no longer have missile silos anymore this all the missile silos have been decommissioned yeah
why we have better means now we can be anywhere you can't hide deep enough from a titanium rod
coming out of space and they went to titanium rods is the same thing they use with abram's tanks
they don't use an explosive device they shoot it with actually a titanium rod comes out who who's
actually using those rods the u.s is right now with abram's tanks we use those on this today
it shoots out a titanium rod titanium rod has a flichette a flichette goes on both sides of it
to fill the actually fill the barrel up with this titanium rod in the center of it and as that is
the rocket or as the flichette is shot out the front they peel away and just this titanium rod
comes out the front and where does it come from space no it's actually this is on the
tanks the abram's tanks that are here now they shoot them on the ground so when you shoot
another tank all you want to do is kill the guys inside so this titanium rod will pierce right
through that skin and go inside and kill all the guys inside jesus very little explosion
other than you know if you have a cookoff of explosive because you've got all the charges
inside the tank and those things get hit they'll go off but there's no explosion and so when they
started realizing uh the the capability of a titanium rod shot at these unbelievable speeds
they see wow look at the danger look at the damage that's done and there's no real explosion there's
no pressure how does that work what is it just it goes so fast exactly you're coming in at supersonic
speeds so if if what the the guy that showed me these are originally on youtube they were called
tunnel bombs and he goes i said so why do they call them tunnel bombs he goes we didn't know what
else to call them we didn't we they were this was these guys were supposed to be dropping these in
syria you know the war was kind of going on yeah it kind of gotten real crazy and this guy was he
was definitely with the cia and he was telling me how they were dropping these titanium rods and i
initially looked at it like you know what part of the cia are you actually with i mean so and uh
dav was able dav had the authority to move satellites so he's a pretty reliable source
and then when he showed me the videos i'm like dude that's pretty impressive it would literally
take out a whole block of this city with no explosion no explosion wow he goes you can't
hide deep enough you can't get into a mountain deep enough that we can't come get you we can be
anywhere with these things in 30 minutes yeah so now again conspiracy people talk about it people
don't talk about it you know is it real you know when you talk about the astronauts and they see
alien beings on the moon or they talk about through project disclosure
one of the guys that's in project disclosure was a navy photographer he got picked up
and had in fact he had a security clearance that i actually if i would have saw these people
sitting with him and he talked about the security clearance he had i thought it was a joke because
i'd never heard of it but he got pulled into a room and he said that uh i had just literally
just started and he goes i thought my job primarily was to look at satellite footage and
kind of make a determination as to what the building we were looking at what that building did
and he goes the guy that was in the in the room while i was there said hey come check this out
these are buildings on the dark side of the moon and he said i was like what and he goes yeah check
these are these are buildings on the dark side of the moon and they're not ours so you when you
now take a moment you step back and you go wait a minute yeah what the fuck but these aren't just
regular people this isn't just a regular guy he's here with matter of fact the the official that
was with this group also was um he sat on a government board out of canada and when they
brought him to the forefront he was the first politician of real authority that came out and said
UFOs are as real as the planes to fly over your house the u.s has been dealing with a group called
the tall whites for the last 15 years and then he went down this this whole thing and you're
like wait a minute tall whites what the hell is that the other guy came out and said we're
we've been in touch with 56 different races of alien beings holy shit these again just aren't
regular guys these are guys with tremendous backgrounds they come from security clearance and
di a and nsa officials that are all part of project disclosure and they wanted to come out
they were actually telling congress hey we want you to come out now and put this big meeting on
so these guys can come out but the problem is if if you come out too quick and you are being on
the payroll because you're a retired military guy we're going to come arrest you now you've just
given up secrets or we don't want to confirm that what you were saying is true but we're going to
go and screw around with your paying now so now you're not going to get paid we're going to
create this problem so a lot of these guys were really sticking it way out there if you got a
project disclosure you can go to the website and look at it um like i say greer is a is a great
guys factual steven greer yep what i like is you know as a doctor and he even comes out and talks
about this he goes as a as a doctor and my buddy here's an lawyer he goes we're under oath we can't
lie if i lie i could lose my license the website is serious disclosure dot com s i r i u s highly
recommended disclosure dot com again dealing with uh educated men who come from great backgrounds
from the military from science professionals from the airlines industry
and when you hear the stories you you're going to scratch your head you're going to be like what
it sounds so unbelievable but yet these guys have no reason to lie the whole idea was about
project disclosure and getting the information out to the american people
so doing so becomes a a challenge in itself because everything just sounds crazy you would
think if the government was going to sort of let this stuff out of the bag they would definitely
want to do it all at once they would do it slowly they would slowly let it let the drip you know what
i mean like the pentagon would declassify the videos then they would slowly sort of release
more things so people just didn't and if you look to the think the cia just released 13 million
pages so this information is being leaked now you know here we are having this conversation
about it yeah so you when you start to take into consideration you know again who knows about brazil
right now i mean i haven't heard anybody really talk about it one way or the other it's amazing
to me that nobody has really talked about it one way or the other but i think again as a country
i know the us would if we sat on it let's just say 1947 actually happened in new mexico and there
was a crash um they would they would most definitely sit on that information and not want to share it
with anybody because of the the roswell the roswell they said it was like a weather balloon
right they came out after the fact they came out one day and said hey now keep in mind out in the
desert there this was the 509th bombing group they were the only group that was authorized to carry
nuclear bombs they come out one day and said oh we found a ufo and they come out two days later
and go holy shit we made a mistake it was a weather balloon i know we're we're the only qualified
nuclear group to carry bombs and we didn't know the difference between a spacecraft well they're
balloon so that right off the get go you fucking liars made everybody think like well wait a minute
and then again now the story started to come out all these years later you have um the children
of the officers that were there and one of the guys he's a dentist today his father brought him
home pieces of it and he said he asked my dad actually came and got me out of bed and said come
out here look at this this is from another world because i sat there as a 12 year old little boy
holding these irons these i-beams in my hand and looking at all these different
signatures and different designs that were on the metal and he said that i was i couldn't believe it
and he goes then my dad came back the next day and said hey forget all about this forget you ever
saw these don't tell anybody about this get this out of the house now so you know then then the the
individual again i'm kind of drawing a blank with his name now that actually came out with this
report and was seen in Wright Patterson Air Force now down over the well i guess i was wrong it was
just a weather balloon um before on his death bed he came back and said it wasn't it wasn't it they
made me say that at the time but i'm on my death bed now there's nothing they can do to me yeah
it they were extraterrestrial beings there were there were other people that saw them they were
small um this is what took place this was and there was actually more than one crash um he even
went to say as far as what brought them down was radar because they were working on our new radar
systems at the time and he goes we brought it down accidentally but we didn't even know what we were
doing so it's kind of some more cool information you're like wait a minute really i didn't remember
hearing that portion of the story yeah that connects to what Bob Lazar was saying and his
when they said that he talks about the aircraft that he was the spacecraft that he was working on
he said it was really small in there he's like it would be for someone who was like four foot tall
five foot tall like super small person and they were genderless they were like bodies that if i
remember correctly it was almost like they were just cadavers that were just sent there they weren't
actual like living organisms they were kind of just like drone and there's more people saying
that today these aren't real these weren't real entities they're just they're right uh uh grown
they are something like a robot they're sent here because you don't have to feed them let's not big
issues in space there's no place there's no place to piss and shit on one of those aircrafts that's
one of these things are genderless they wouldn't put the food to travel billions of light years
you know exactly where you put all the food we have those same challenges today
how do you maintain your health how do you maintain bone mass and muscle mass and a no weight
how do you procreate there were nasa was talking about the other night how do you procreate space
you can't because everything you're trying to do to have a baby is going to be counteractive
and every force has an equal and opposite force so you're going to be all over the place yeah um
listen to him talk about go to mars you know he said that we one thing we've looked at is we can
take your your um your poo and you can put in a bag and put it on the sides of the the spacecraft
because it'll actually block out the harmful rays of radiation so they said that's one thing you can
do with it i'm like well that's a good but where's the food coming from right how you're going to
live for six eight nine months on that trip out there yeah how do you maintain that muscle mass
how do you maintain bone density right by the time they said they get there your your body
wouldn't be able to support the the muscle the bones would be so soft right so you know are we
going today tomorrow back to the moon whenever you know did we go to the moon again opens up a
whole other can of worms yeah definitely but you know when you look back now they've got a new
program well they had a new program in dc called atip and it was um let me see what did it stand
for stand for advanced aerospace threat identification and the guy that ran the program
was a retired veteran from the marine corps and got involved with it and his name was
lewis alizando and he ran this for i want to say from 2009 to 2014 he's also the ones that was
responsible for releasing the ufo uh that the navies had recorded so he's the one that actually
got the information to release those videos through the pentagon and um he worked on this atip for
all those years trying to approve or disprove the fact that these vehicles these ufo's these
extraterrestrial beings were actually coming to the planet right and so he's you can you can find
him now online as well as a host of information with regards to black market or black projects
across the board yeah advanced aerospace threat identification program atip a atip secret
investigative secret investigatory effort funded by the united states government to study
unidentified flying objects or unexplained aerial phenomena uap the program was first
made public on december 16 2017 the program began in 2007 with funding of 22 million over five years
until the available appropriations were ended in 2012 and hardly anybody knew who about atip
who they were what what their background never heard of that yeah but again very cool and it's
crazy how much money they the small amount of money that they dedicate to space research and
the study the study the science that goes into outer space it's like something around like
five years ago it was around two to three million dollars a year was what the government was allocating
to outer space research or this kind of stuff atip stuff when the yearly cost to run a mcdonald's
is something like 22 million dollars like i see it's it's crazy this is what kind of again when i
have these conversations with some of the moon you know hey we went to the moon we didn't go to the
moon like listen why aren't we going back you know it's a pretty big deal um if we had been to the
moon already why aren't we back there now oh budgets but i like listen dude the space force
has taken off there's more talk now than ever that i've been alive on what's really going on in
deep space right i would think we'd already have a base on the moon if we had the capabilities to go
there or or shouldn't we have or do we i mean i don't know if we do or not or shouldn't we be
spending money on developing ways to mitigate the threat of a an eight mile wide asteroid from
hitting the earth and they're looking at that we can see them when they're coming we know when
they're coming absolutely if we know one's going to there should be we should be developing or
spending more money on that kind of research and listen they are there you know some of the
challenges now as well how do you how do you make this thing go away like arm and get it right do you
do yeah do you land on it and drill some holes and put some rockets on it try to push it yeah do you
use a uh a microwave energy and create um enough of a push that you could deflect it some other
guys talk about hey we will shoot missiles at it well then if you break it up into pieces
she's still all coming from us and pieces yeah i mean so you've taken a an item that's you know
10 tons and now it's like a buckshot of 10 tons coming into the u.s. yeah hit the work hit the
world so right um taking into consideration some of the things we can and can't do uh you know
did we go to the moon um if you go and look at some of the different uh anti-moon people they
call them flat earthers um that don't believe that we went to the moon right um it's compelling
when you look at the land the lunar rover and you you look how close the the the rocket now
it will sit to the ground you go why is there a blast crater into that thing i would think right
you know and then the the people who defend it come out say well it was it's an adjustable
descent motor you can go from 10 000 pounds to 3000 pounds i'm like well dude still 3000
pounds it'll move a lot of dirt and there's no mark there and it's like powder sand and you
know you the the guys who are the believers will come back and immediately hammering in the ground
i'm asking a question i'm like listen i'm just interested i apollo 11 and one of the lunar
landers looks like the back of the lunar lander has these aluminum uh slats that were put there
they were kind of put in with uh maybe four rivets it doesn't look like this thing would go 4 000 miles
an hour and land on the moon there's definitely so many questions about the moon landing that
outweigh the proof that that we did land on the moon right i mean the only thing that we have is
what a video well the argument is this how can how many millions and millions of engineers
and people who were took part of the program how could all these people be wrong right and and i'm
like well listen if you look at there was a movie called um capricorn one that dealt with this is
back in the early 80s that dealt with landing on they were going to go to mars and before they took
off they realized they couldn't go to mars so they decided to make a fake landing in mars um there is
talk of um he's another he actually made the movie 2001 space odyssey oh the director the director
and he actually uh was given four of the 10 cameras carl zeiss made the cameras for the
astronauts to take into space and these were very specific cameras lenses that could shoot in zero
light you can have a candlelight and you can shoot in that well for some reason nasa gave
stanley cubrick is his name stanley cubrick yeah they gave stanley cubrick four of those cameras
or four of those lenses what yeah why uh the 10 that you made you gave four to stanley why would
you give four of those to stanley cubrick that doesn't make any sense to me oh by the way
nasa was with him the whole time that he made his movies about the moon landings they were
so what is it they were apparently there were some nasa consultants or nasa engineers somebody
who worked at nasa was on set during the production doing the whole production of the show the whole
show yeah the whole event yeah and of course every now the believers will tell you well they were
there because they were giving stanley cubrick advice when the people from came stanley cubrick
will tell you they were asking questions on hey how did you make that that meteorite strike in the
dirt wait did that movie come out before the moon landing i don't i'm not i came out after it was
like 19 it came out after yeah i want to say like in the early 70 71 72 well if it was after
the moon landing then why would they be trying to why would nasa be trying to look for information
for stanley cubrick if it was after well they were they the story goes that nasa was impressed
because they're they're guided all the handle their special effects what he did was he went out and
got um it's called portland cement and it's like a real fine powder and he made the setting
with this portland cement well he would go up 40 feet drop a ball bearing down and it would
make the strike that looked just like an asteroid had strike the surface of the moon yeah so he did
that to give this whole moon like effect and the nasa folks were like wow dude that really looks real
hey i got an idea maybe we can't go to the moon we can sure make it look like we went to the moon
so but again so the question for me was well why would you even give the camera but the moon video
was already out at this point the moon landing was already out um yes okay yes they are okay yes
they are but now these remember and maybe and listen maybe maybe this movie was made back in 68
so just in the in apollo 11 went in 69 yeah so you probably look it up but there was they
definitely went there during the same period 68 oh 68 2001 space odyssey was released in 68 okay
so and apollo 11 i think went 69
69 i think it was 1969 that they went there yeah 69 69 so and just had some strange there was some
strange well nobody wants to think that the u.s government is lying about going to the moon
oh it's impossible you can't well i mean why are we having this conversation then if it's a
why if it's impossible we can't why was standing the moon landing was one year after space odyssey
came out yep so that makes sense why they were there because they were trying to they were trying to
to mimic or make to figure out how they did it so well bingo so it's i mean listen and the guys
that's not true but yeah i'm like well listen why would nasa out of these 10 lenses that were made
give Stanley Kubrick four of them doesn't make sense to me they want to use the same
fucking lenses they want to make the same sort of effect exactly right so interesting you know when
you start looking at it then when you start you know i i started looking at like the um the
astronaut uniform they're the spacesuits they wore yeah the suits weigh about 475 pounds
okay astronaut suits the ones they use to walk on the moon with holy shit okay now that again
kind of a pros and questions like oh damn that's a lot of weight well the the atmosphere there is
one sixth of what it is here on the planet so believe it or not right with the that's with
the astronaut in a by the suits actually like 180 pounds and if you take 180 pound man put him in
there you're close to 500 pounds and um uh when they started looking at the bigger picture because
they said listen the man's on the planet he only weighs 60 pounds when he's on the moon surface
well if you start looking at him real hard and you look at the size of the entrance into the
lunar lander you're like can that guy really get in the lunar lander in that thing can you get out
of the lunar lander in that thing what's the what's the uniform made of what's got a lot of
kevlar and mylar in it well i know kevlar is heavy yeah um dude so i have had a 60 pound we did we
did a backpack through the appellation mountains and i carried a 60 pound back through the mountains
right what's that feel like that's a heavy pack yeah so when you listen to these astronauts talk on
there as they're going around collecting rocks it's you know they're singing on the moon and i'm
good having a great time out here man i'm not tired at all i can just do this all day long
i don't hear anybody breathing hard and there's some references to heart rates going up but
listen when you're when you're working hard you're going to be sweating you're going to hear
that noise and you just don't hear that so again it's kind of an odd duck thing like really i would
think you guys would be huffing a puff a little bit more yeah up there how did you keep the lunar
lander you know it was almost 400 what 375 degrees on this when the sun was out and so you got to
keep the air conditioning on the lunar lander for a long time where's that fuel coming from
let's from a battery you know you're like well let me look at the look on batteries and how
how good do we have batteries back in the 60s yeah you know they weren't very good in the 80s
or that small just in the good and holy charge so you again you start kind of looking at the
ducks and you're like well you know if it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck is it really
a duck or is it something else because i'm going to go with it it's the fact that it's a duck
but you know again taking into consideration you look at everything that's going on and today
yeah that thing looks so flimsy it looks like it's made at tinfoil dude it's and there's actually
a video where a guy comes out and kind of makes fun of the whole thing and i'm looking i'm like
he makes sense yeah and the believers man will come out and just blister you with regard i can't
believe you're un-american and blah blah and believe it or not a lot of these guys read from
is it considered un-american to question the moon landing the people i talked to you said it was
now the funny part was that some of these most these guys were from uh the uk i like so why do
you guys have a dog in this fight what do you care if you went to the moon or not well it's
ridiculous that you would think that you didn't no you didn't answer my question why does somebody
in the uk care about what we did on our space program it's kind of bizarre to me i would think
you'd be you know one of the guys maybe at nasa who's a who retired from there and i'm going to
tell you why it's not fake yeah well it all goes back to that thing and you know people just want
to look for things that reinforce what they're what they already believe or what they're already
what they're already looking for for i agree i think that's exactly what happens but you know
again when you take into consideration these events from atyp or skinwalker ranch or the
us navy that are taking place we're gonna say listen if you talk to somebody usually they've
got a kind of a a story that's kind of paranormal that you know me incorporate something else like
i've never seen a ghost i you know i don't know if i necessarily believe it or not but i yeah i
haven't seen him i got other friends of mine who've seen him and said oh my god you know
scariest thing i ever saw in my life most terrified i've ever been and i try to figure out why haven't
i seen one why what's the difference is it not taking the right not you're not taking the right
kind of drugs that's the problem i do it but you know you look at these different events that
take place and like i say i think that uh this event in in brazil if it's if it's true um i at
this point don't have any reason not to believe that it is true yeah i can't wait to see more about
that yeah to see really what what stands up i mean is this is this all part of this you know
this lockdown that we're going through is this did somebody know this was going to happen right
because even some of these groups that we're talking about red flags and the government
saying oh they're gonna you know tell everybody that the ufo's are attacking us and i kind of
really chuckled at that i'm like well dude that's i mean that's a long reach but hey listen maybe
this was five or six months ago so when this event happened i haven't called them i haven't told
them about the brazilian thing at all because they're like see i told you what was going on
so i've kind of kept it from them but listen at some point if it's true i have at this point no
reason to believe that it's not it's going to come out and it's going to be uh it will be something
worth of talking about and whether they see it was a ufo or they say something crashed there
and the military took it away it's still going to create enough of a of a mystery
that people are going to want to know yeah you know you got people there that are trying to fly
drones over the area um they're trying to take hang the lighters in um and see where it came
through the trees and some of these guys were talking about doing i heard that yeah our guys
talking about do uh paragliding around there around it so trying to find more information on
so again like i say something definitely took place you know it's just how far do you want to
believe and when i again when i started asking the questions to kind of turn over the rocks i did
from a perspective of look i know you guys are busy right now but i got a question to ask and you
know half of me wanted to believe oh this is kind of cool yeah you know the other half the reality
side was like wait a minute you know how real is this and and what are they really going to tell
you yeah um even when it's funny after the fact um the former chief of police there in brazil
i sent him a quick hey dude i figured this out boop told me that they're there on
site now with it locked down and he replied back to me like i didn't even know UFO crashed here
so so he again like i say man uh he's he's retired he still lives in rio but i would
figure that everybody would know and maybe he did know he just wanted to tell me that's why
i didn't reply back to you right off the get yeah yeah because he didn't reply back to me till i told
him that i got the information from the guys at boop and then he was like i didn't even know
UFO crashed here it wasn't like no a UFO didn't crash here let me just go ahead and correct this
whole situation it was i didn't know this event even happened yeah so i've kept it on my phone i
go back and look at every day even the day after i had talked to the group here um i called the supreme
leader and i said hey you pulled my leg the other day are you being serious to these like
why would i like i'm telling you we were just sitting here talking about it it's it's that amazing
and i'm like so you are being absolutely you're not pulling my leg is no dude i'm not pulling
your leg it's whatever took place there it's real and it's going on right now so again it's
just such a big news you know we're approaching that perspective in our life now i mean it's
supposedly happened so many times with these crashes around the world right they had one
crash in pittsburgh pennsylvania um that took place and in uh i want to say the the late 70s
out in the woods there um and everybody kind of you know played it off and oh no it didn't
really happen yet you meet or you watch a show that has the mayor on there and he goes yeah not
like that i brought the preacher with me because they said they thought it was a plane that went
down and they wanted me to bring the preacher out there to read everybody their last will and rights
but we got out there and it was some kind of bell-looking object that we'd never seen before
so now you're like with scratching your head going like what what are we talking about here right
so it's like i say i think the phenomenon is going to get bigger yeah i think that um it it
obviously there's got to be some truth to it i can't believe that all these people are there's
something going on there has to be for sure there has to be while brazilian press reports
that no one reported these objects to local authorities allegations of loud explosions
and gunshots the brazilian military um cordon what does that mean cordoning
cordoning military cordoning off the area um an army personnel arresting anyone trying to get
close to this supposed crash site have taken over twitter and the subreddit aliens i mean you know
again here we go we've locked it down we don't know why we've locked it down and if you get near
the place by the way we're gonna arrest you so it makes you scratch your head so something is
obviously going on there and whether it's you know and why do these aliens keep going to brazil
i think it's probably a great place to go south america in general it's those brazilian wax jobs
that the girls do but again you know you wouldn't think about it you would think are you kidding me
why brazil of all the places you know why alaska right is it so is it so desolate there that you
can come and go as you want i mean there's there's places on the map now on google earth where they
say in in arctica there's an opening where these things are coming and going every day
and that um oh yeah there's a there's there's theories that there's aliens flying around on
laser beams inside the earth oh yeah so i mean again whether it's true or it's not true there's
always a little bit of truth to some of it and if you go back and you start kind of like okay well
let's talk about the egyptians again let's go back to the mayans let's go back to these guys who
were cutting these stones and moving rock and doing things that were you know i know you weren't
doing with a hammer and a chisel especially a brass one yeah you know so is it a ufo that
taught you how to this you look at the pyramids and when you go inside the pyramids you see all
this beautiful artwork that's in there well who the hell was holding the flashlight yeah what were
they using to light the inside of those rooms i mean it wasn't it wasn't a flame right because
you'd have black soot all over the ceiling um and not only that two of the guys i spoke to that were
both of these guys were archaeologists and they had worked with the pyramids
they said the problem with the pyramids is just like a cave that in certain areas there's only
limited oxygen so you go back in these real dark tight areas and they have to bring a thing to
make sure that the oxygen stays at particular levels so he goes you couldn't burn a fire inside
that you know to try to use this light to but you just wouldn't have the oxygen there to be able to
do that right fire wouldn't burn so yeah so you're like well okay i never thought about that that's
kind of interesting but again they so it leads you right back to the whole alien story again
and trying to figure out what is really going on how do these stones get made why are they so
perfect and they're engineering how do they know this technology and then you get the
Egyptologist or the the ancient alien theologians that come out and say hey listen this is really
what took place but it makes you scratch your head and you think well listen something
right from a phenomenal uh is going on because you wouldn't be able to do these events or or
to look at these things or to come up with the ideology that you're coming with today right
you know who thinks about that shit so shit is wild going on something's going on just amazing
absolutely something's going on man like i say project disclosure's got it going on okay um
if you look at if you guys look up um the uh lewis elisando that's el i z o n d o uh formally with
a tip a tip yeah was a advanced aerospace threat identification program really really cool lots of
information yeah lewis elisando now he's part of to the stars tts a company co-funded by tom
de long what from blink 182 blink 182 did he is a he's in the ufo oh dude he is big big matter of
fact he came out and said i want to thank everybody for for now allowing this this uh stuff from the
navy to come out because it's proved me right yeah wow he's been like that for a long time actually
and he's actually said some people have come to his house and told him to shut his mouth
about some of the things he was saying in the past really it's kind of interesting yeah yeah
and he goes just because i'm this this guy who's got a uh a microphone that everybody
will kind of listen to yeah but they came to my house and don't hey you shouldn't be talking
about things you don't know anything about he's like well i guess i proved you guys wrong because
obviously here we are having this conversation now but that's amazing i guess that's crazy wild
shit unbelievable man so i'll tell you another story real quick i'm at my house um i live out
by the beach and i come out one night to take a look down by the water and i see this uh red
light in the sky and i'm kind of staring at it because it's kind of unusual it's out over the
water and it looks like the same type of red light you would see in a tower in these blinking
towers radio towers yeah yeah and so as i'm kind of watching it all of a sudden it turns from red
to like almost like a star color and i i noticed then like oh damn there's three more
there just like that i wonder if they're the same thing well then another one pops up
and all in all 18 of them popped up and as i'm trying to watch these things and trying to
throw what the hell am i looking at here um i went in the house and got my night vision real
quick came back outside and i'm watching these things and these these what looked like a red
long light turned into a white light that hung there for about 20 minutes looked like a star
and they started moving down the beach but when they moved down the beach they actually
turned into you ever see these uh these uh uh skin colored synthetic gloves you put on the
rubber gloves like a latex latex glove it was that color but and they were kind of clear
and on the outside it had a light that went around it yeah and without the night vision on you
couldn't see this and one all of them except one went down the beach this actually came over and
went over our house could one of those chinese lanterns that people do for like memorials dude
you know i mean for shanley or for space yeah and listen i tried to think of everything but
the strange thing was you couldn't see it without the night vision on what it looked like was
looked like a dirty cotton ball in the air well maybe because it was so far away the light was dim
but when you put the night vision on it intensifies the light so you could actually see it better
from well that but the problem is this thing was like right over my house okay so it wasn't like
a long far distance away and so i'm looking at this trying to figure what the hell am i looking at
here i mean so it's just one of those kind of odd events i mean listen we went to me and Danny went
to arrange to go do some shooting in florida in florida yeah yeah what was that town called um
this is over by it's in brandon i can't think of the little town the little community we're in
but it's it's literally out in the middle of nowhere it's in the middle of nowhere we're shooting
guns out here it's near i want to say it's near like bar toe area yeah it's near bar toe it's near um
what is the little town that's right there i can't think of the town i'll think of it here in a second
but so we go out there to go shooting and we're in this is a place where we bring special operations
guys out we blow stuff up and we can shoot and move and you don't have to worry about and so
dany went to come out and take us some video of us he got a really nice drone and sent this drone
up above the facility we're at and we'll say it was a half mile to a mile up and i could hear it
yeah so we do all this videoing as we come home that evening i go back i take this footage back
to my house and i start going through it i'm looking at for particular uh views of the gun we're
shooting and my peripheral vision picks up like this dirty little ball of light that i see in the
video real quick and so i stop it i'm like what the heck was that and i go back and look at it i'm
like wow check that out what is that yeah looks like someone beamed a golf ball at the drone or shot
shot the drone and it was like this big white bullet coming right at literally and so i i sent
it to the end i'm like hey dude check this out on these frames now the frames i'd originally
given him were incorrect and so he went back through and he found him he goes oh yeah dude
i found it and so he would sent me a video that we just witnessed and went through it at a clip
at a time yeah right here and was able to pull it out towards the end of it i'm just sitting i got
the drone just sitting there hovering and then if you go frame by frame you can see this like white
golf ball looking thing coming right at the drone but it goes underneath it
but you can tell it definitely got redirected and then all of a sudden these guys from the
beyond unknown show almost the same type of again i don't know what they're gonna call it a light a
golf ball a bean bag yeah whatever that is something they recorded the same thing it looks about the
size of it probably bigger than what a golf ball would look like flying that far away like i say
they try to say it was a bird they try to say and even when danie had talked about hey somebody's
shooting at my damn drone yeah i'm like dude i couldn't see it was a mile up right over her head
they this is like two miles away there's no way they could have shot at that from that distance
of two miles and even been that close right and this is the video you sent me which is somebody
else and this is like the same exact thing and now what is this video from
you kind of look like that but no when i saw this is from beyond the unknown okay it's just
guys doing science work then about 60 seconds later another mysterious object flies by
that looks exactly like whatever that was i mean that's exactly it's the same but again it's odd
it's funny that these are all drones that are getting these this video yeah and nothing and i
think it's the sound of the drone that's actually attracting these things now you know what are
they that's that becomes the big question that thing came from the sky the sky yeah the one the
one on my drone looked like it came almost just directly at it parallel well i think it came
from the wood line that down low and then came up high i think you have still have the original
video of this yeah i do have it somewhere and and for to check it out but again it's just kind of
those weird things where wait a minute this was probably five years ago when we did this four
years ago we did this four or five years ago for sure this video that just came out is just now
and these guys are also picking it up on their drones and then there's another guy that was in
utah that was a doing work on the oil fields and he was actually doing reconnaissance on some areas
for new oil and one of these things flew out and was the exact same thing and he was actually able
to put a speed to it which he said it was 3,800 miles an hour it had covered two miles and two
seconds and came up with the 3,800 mile an hour so he's like i don't know what this is now the one
that dany videoed initially like i said when you watch the video you don't even see it and i just
happened to pick it up with my peripheral vision because it's moving so fast yeah you could miss
that easily and then oh very easily and then as i went through it some more there's either was even
more that were in the video so the average bullet according to quora travels 2,500 feet per second
around 1,700 miles per hour so it shows you right there i mean again that's twice the speed
of a bullet 2,000 miles an hour faster than a bullet so i you know it makes you scratch your head
so wait a minute that was like a four frame it was like four frames that thing that came through
the drone shot there was like four frames you could see that white thing coming through right
right so how do we do the math that that video clip was shot at 24 frames a second so 24 divided
by four is what 24 divided by four is six right so what would that that would be uh
i'm fucking terrible at math like i said i just assumed it was about the same distance about
two miles we were looking at right and that if it and literally covered that now on the video or
the original video you can't see it but when you go slow it down and you start doing the math okay
well it covered you can't see it at full speed no i mean it literally just kind of showed up as a
spot so it was 16 16.6 percent of a second i mean that thing was in the frame dude that's crazy
think about how fast that is really and how and the fact that we even were able to see that thing
and pull it up and look at it and the fact that it showed up now and two other tv shows on tv it's
the same yeah white the same golf ball the same whatever it is it's the same yeah and again it
makes you just scratch your head like okay what is this and why would it care about what our drones
are doing which is just odd to me all the way around when i even when we viewed that the first
one there were more of those whatever that is in there as well i could see him yeah but it you know
you get tied up with other things and all of a sudden reality of life comes back yeah i gotta
feed the kids and take a bath yeah i wish i could get paid to search this kind of shit let me tell
you it would be i mean some of the stories are just amazing that that you talk about i saw things in
and uh some guys talked about stuff that happened in vietnam there was some UFO incidents there that
happened on a couple of the rivers i mean and it just goes on and on and on and you're like well
listen not everybody can be lying about this no and most people i mean with some of the strange
things that i've seen i didn't go running out let me tell everybody about it you know we happen to
have you having this conversation now me sharing those one with the red lights the the funny part
was the night that i saw those lights donald was gone from the house my neighbor was gone the kids
were all gone i couldn't share it with anybody i'm like i want to show somebody you know but i
couldn't my phone wouldn't pick up the the red light so i couldn't even videotape it to show anybody
but so you're like well what kind of how do you validate that right yeah mike said he was saying
stuff again you saw some red lights in the sky oh what's he taking what's mike smoking i need some
of it so you know you kind of keep them to yourself but at some point as this thing becomes
more and more relevant someone's gonna let the cat out of the bag yeah and they're gonna come out and
say hey man these things exist we're not the only ones here you know unfortunately religion isn't
set up like you thought it is and i think people too are afraid well if it's not set up like that
why should i be a good guy then i mean why don't you go out here and rob and kill right i mean it's
gonna be wait all the dots are gonna be connected and listen you're either a good person or you're
not you know either a shit bag yeah and do the right thing because it is the right thing to do
or you're one of those guys that just isn't i mean if you know if you're obviously hurting animals
i know that a bullet was all that real problem real quick kind of that guy that's going to
hurt animals you know what i'm saying so we're we're at a place right now with mankind where
i think about every 50 years there's a significant change in the way we think about things
you talk to people today about certain events that have taken place i think we've all seen
something that is kind of odd or out of place that would be considered paranormal but who do you
tell you know and there's so much of this are you really looking for attention mike yeah that's
how you're trying to get all the attention maybe your parents didn't love you very much
but listen at the end of the day something is going on and when we see this stuff that
danie's picked up on his we see it on tv shows it's the same exact whatever it is that we're
looking at there there's something going on yeah and how they're all interrelated and
how they correspond with each other is still yet to be seen but i think that through some great
podcasts and some information telling and the stuff that rogan's doing and you're doing
you start to connect the dots and i think at the end of the day we'll get this figured out
dude right now i think we've covered i just really want to find out more about the brazilian
story yeah me too that's the that's the icing on the cake that is hopefully just doesn't get
like buried on the internet forgotten i mean hopefully something you know something's got
to happen something someone's got to come forward and just they can't keep everyone
locked down and keep their lips i want to see pictures photographs you know video um you know
again i don't know how close these guys are really get to there again the scary part is that the
brilliant the brazilian authorities will kill you you know so i was kind of telling you about
how they don't play around there are no civil rights there if they tell you stay out of here
or i'm going to shoot you you better stay out there you're going to get shot so delete that video
or whatever it is so you know you're taking you're taking into consideration your life
literally if this is a true event and you're going to go hey i'm going to go get the truth
be careful yeah be careful because i just know like i say those guys do not play around
from the perspective i've seen them right and then there's not going to be any warning shots
they don't even know warning shots are my god so well shit we just did two hours thank you for
coming on and uh talk about this stuff super fascinating thanks for having me back i need
to learn more yeah we'll do it again thanks so much all right thanks later
