I'm not- I ain't gonna lie to-
We just wanna make sure that you're cool with it before we-
Fuck it, throw it back on? Are we good with this?
The only person I ever have to lie to is the goddamn judge.
Fucking lion-cheek-fucking-rich-pieces-of-shit-fucking-get-rich-er-off-the-fucking-ones-that-are-breaking-our-hands.
Fuck you motherfuckers.
That's what I gotta say about the whole IFQ thing.
Fuck down.

You have to use my cup. I gotta use this one.
I don't have any red cups on here.
That's fine.
Cheers!
Cheers, bro.
You know, I got something to do with my hands.
This is the main group report in the world, right here, the Deer Beach.
Because of all the cuts in the boats and such and the IFQs, they're down to just a little
bit over a million pounds a year here.
They went down from like a three and a half million down to a million, a million three,
I think, or something like that.
These guys have all been working at this for the same fish house forever, the Deer Beach
Seafood.
You ever seen Old MacDonald had a farm?
When you start making them fucking insect sounds back there, Old MacDonald had, on that
farm he had a great, great, great, great, when you start singing that crazy shit, that's
when, man, I'd rather listen to some fucking Metallica or something back here while you're
killing shit.
Right.
Yeah, these are my winter shoes.
It was got down to fucking 60 this morning.
Fuck, yeah.
Born star.
Oh, my God.
I'm about ready to touch my fucking naughty parts.
Commercial fishermen are a different breed.
They don't belong in a suit and tie society, not at all.
Shamely.
It's just the old barnacle been around here a long time.
He's a, you know, you know what a curd dog or a junkyard dog is.
These kind of reminds me of the past.
It was completely different than it is today.
You had a lot of camaraderie.
You had a lot of craziness.
You had bars and cops wouldn't even go in.
They're a special breed of people.
Hi, my name is Shane, motherfuckerly.com, www.com, fuck yeah.com, fuck yeah, and fuck yeah.
Well, I heard that the devil's walking around.
Fuck it.
I got the tools to show you.
Fuck it.
Wings.
Fuck it.
Ferry.
Fuck it.
Bag it.
Fuck it.
Fuck it.
Fuck it.
I'm not faggot, but we fucking got it off.
I got the new job.
I got them.
They're down there in the boat.
Fuck yeah.
It's not evil.
When we're not evil people, we're fucking real.
Fuck yeah.
I know this black dude.
Fuck yeah.
Yeah, he called me nigger Eddie, but I'm really not a nigger.
Oh, he's not black.
How the fuck are you?
You shouldn't give him beer.
What should we give him?
It's like the grimmlings, you know?
He used to be my neighbor.
I'm gonna tell you what.
He'd have Spock rolling down the street.
Fuck it.
The cops would beat on his door.
I mean the music.
Blair, he's got speakers like this big.
Eddie could be in the back fucking part of Madeira Beach.
We'd have the whole neighborhood rocking.
Let's go to the laser light show, motherfuckers.
Let's go to the laser light show.
We're down here in Madeira Beach at the Dackery Shack.
Shane, he gave me his four pack of Bush, and we're gonna go to his boat for a laser light show.
Fuck yeah.
Time out.
Triple X.
Fuck, welcome aboard.
I got life insurance too.
Fuck yeah.
All right.
You got a life insurance?
Right here.
Come on in.
Good shit.
Fuck yeah.
Commerce.
All right.
Now.
You got the PlayStation hookup?
Fuck yeah.
These are all pornos.
That whole stack is pornos?
You just look at them yourself.
They sure are.
This is my fucking thing right here.
Okay.
Marilyn, I was there for Marilyn.
Okay.
In this tour, fucking some girl fucking sung.
She threw them up there during Tainted Love.
Marilyn Manson put them on saying Tainted Love.
Took them fuckers off.
Stomped them, son of a bitches.
Threw them out there, but who was the one to get them?
Fuck yeah.
This is a Marilyn Manson signature autograph from my fucking...
Motherfucking...
Yes.
That's your favorite shit?
We're gonna go ahead and sit that motherfucker up right there.
This is...
I got like six bars, but they're fucking...
Where'd you get those?
Online.
Fucker?
Okay.
Hold up.
These are...
What the fuck?
What are you fucking shit me?
That ain't enough of that shit.
Need some more smoke.
We're currently at Shane's boat listening to Marilyn Manson
and drinking Bush.
He brought us back here to party and blast his fog machine,
his laser lights and show us his favorite DVD.
Mr. Manson, if you're out there, you're moved.
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Yeah, motherfuckers, that's the way I roll.
How you do it?
Fuck yeah.
Shane Lee's amphitheater.
Sit here and watch rock and roll videos.
I fish for the people.
On an average trip, I'll make 15 to 2000.
The bottom line of every one of them fucking tickets they give us,
you got your little fuel bill, you got your tackle, you got your ice,
you got your bee.
Now we're coming up with people from who the fuck knows.
They get a percentage of my check.
These people get a percentage of my check.
These people get a percentage of my check.
My hand's barely working anymore.
That's my knuckle shoved all the way up in there
because my hand hit the fucking block.
But I don't get nothing out of that, do I?
This one's from a deal.
Crazy, just like a mutilating to myself.
I just hope we ever got some peace of that.
It's just happier than what I am.
I mean, this is what I live in.
Granted, I've got everything I want right there.
I just need my little boat.
That, my friends, need my motherfucking friends.
That's all I need.
This is my 750 watt receiver and the Rob Zombie video
with Johnny Fife.
Who got Marilyn Manson?
Fuck.
Oh my god.
