There's a term, they call it the Greek miracle, and they're like,
people look at the classical period up until Plato, and they just go,
what the hell happened? There's just an explosion of intellect.
And look, before the Catholic Church, the Elysianian mysteries dominated everything.
It was the biggest thing there was. Plato was initiated, Socrates was initiated,
Alexander the Great was initiated, Augustus was initiated, Cleopatra, Julia Domna,
all the greatest, most famous people you can think of were all initiated in the Elysianian
mysteries. At these initiations, their lives would be transformed, and they no longer fear death.
And the whole point of the initiation was salvation. And if you're initiated in the mysteries,
when you die, there's a special place for you in Hades, designated for the initiates of the
mysteries. It's called Elysium, and it's where everybody just parties 24-7 in bliss.
