Hello. How old are you? 19. You're 19. How the hell is a 19-year-old learn to like do
all this coding and all this crazy shit tracking jets and all that? How did you get interested
in this? I had a little bit of coding experience from like school and like you know you could
like just start looking stuff up and aviation related. I knew about like those flight tracking
websites and my dad works in the aviation industry and so like I just started during COVID I had a
lot of free time and I was just looking stuff up and I knew Elon had a jet so I could track him
and I just started figuring it all out. But what gave you the idea like maybe I should
track Elon's jet and post it on Twitter? Well I knew he had one and people like knew it was his
plane but on those like major websites you can't track his plane because there's these rules like
about that certain planes have to be blocked and like I was like you know I'm interested in like
Tesla and SpaceX and him on Twitter so I was like why not share it to Twitter? How did you get into
aviation? Are you you know how to fly planes? No. I just find planes interesting and my dad
works in aviation. Oh really? Do you ever you live in Orlando so you don't live far from Cape
Canaveral? Do you ever go over there? Oh yeah yeah for the launches. You do? Have you ever met Elon
in person? No. What do you think he'd say to you if you actually met him? How do you think that would
go down? I don't know. I mean he was intrigued like the first like you know he never really got mad
he just blocked me after the news came out that like he offered me five thousand to take it down.
He blocked you? Yeah. On all of his Twitter accounts? Yeah. Why do you think you did that?
Because like all the news came out that he offered the five grand to take it down.
Oh because you posted the screenshots and stuff? Yeah. Wow. So can you walk me through the process
of how you actually have so it's a bot you created that posts these tweets whenever his plane takes
off and is heading somewhere can you explain like the process like technically how does that work?
So like all planes have transponders and they're like transmitting their like telemetry which is
like their altitude and their identifier and their speed and the location and there's like different
well one person can get like can get like a receiver for like a hundred dollars and you
can receive like all the planes and with like a hundred miles but companies and organizations
found that if people in different groups around the world they get those they can create a world
map so I get that data from one company called ADSB exchange and then my program reads that data and
it looks for the certain planes that I programmed it so for landing and take off and then it'll
tweet those to the certain Twitter accounts. What is it called ADSB? Exchange. Exchange. It's like
flight aware and all those but they don't block anything. Is that one of those things that came
out after 9-11? I mean I think that's why it came out but yeah pretty much because like
air traffic controllers still like they only use radar really and it's kind of better than that
because it uses less power and it's just there's easier to acquire signal from the planes and
there's more data about the planes rather than just radar. What were you thinking when you
decided to start posting these things and then it's and then Elon met like how did that go about
when Elon DM'd you or how did he contact you? How did he go about contacting you? Like the first
message was can you can you take this down it's a security risk. That's it just like 1 a.m. yeah.
And what did you do you read it and then what were you thinking when you read it you just
instantly responded to him or what? No I think I I think I didn't open it because I saw a notification
and it was like so late I was like I just said to my roommate I was like oh my
yeah. You just told him that Elon just DM'd you but you didn't want to open it because you
weren't you didn't know what you were going to say? Yeah. So what did you eventually respond to him with?
Um yeah I think I was like in a jokingly matter yeah I can but uh can you like increase it to 50 or
whatever or well the whoa that was further down um I can't. You said he said it's a security risk
and you don't remember what your first response was? No I can't remember but he went on a while
and he was asking like how it worked and he didn't even know about like ADSB and like he thought I
was just looking at certain types of planes taking off and he was like no I can just identify it by
your your planes identifier. By what like the little license thing on the plane? Yeah so like
the registration number yeah his is uh November 628 Tango Sierra and then that links to like a
code of the transponder and it doesn't it's always the same. So everyone can track these things?
Yeah. That's pretty wild I didn't even know that and and then he was uh he was saying how uh after
that he was like air traffic control is so primitive. He said that to you? Yeah and he said
what should I do and I told him about this other blocking program which he has now so like the code
on his plane he can change every 60 days but I just have to find it every 60 days. So you told him
how he can evade your bot tracker yeah and he's now using that yeah but I mean it's still it's not
full proof. Right dude that's pretty wild and what did he say so you said can you increase it to 50
can you add a zero to that make it 50,000? What would you say? He said uh thinking about it and
then it went on for a while and uh and then you sold them out. A couple messages like yeah there's
a reporter talking to me about uh something else that was going on in the Tesla community I just
was talking to them about it and then started spreading everywhere. Really? Yeah. When at what
point did all these news stations start reaching out to you? When the first article came out and
then it started going everywhere all over the news and yeah. When did you first create this?
June 2020. June of 2020 and it and back in December 2020 he actually flew to Hawaii
and someone quote tweeted my Elon jet tweet and then he responded oh I'm just meeting Larry Ellison
in Hawaii. Larry Ellison. Which is like uh the CEO of Java or the founder of job wait
is that right oracle oracle oracle yeah I don't even know what is oracle they make Java oh okay
and he was like I'm just meeting with them for some advice but he was people were saying he was
like on vacation and stuff but like back then he didn't seem mad right and I was tracking him
right and you think that he just blocked you on all of your Twitter accounts because you sold
out sold him out that he was offering you money yeah and then like you think about like three or
four weeks ago he unblocked Elon jet probably because like he didn't want to see him like he was
anti like free speech for like his whole Twitter stuff recently. He only but that he unblocked
Jack Sweeney your personal account no interesting man what do you think what do you think about
the whole do you think maybe if you didn't show everybody the screenshots of the DMs maybe you
could actually made that 50 grand I don't think so because no at some point like before he said
it didn't feel right to pay to take it down so like that was even before the news came out
so he didn't feel like it even before then yeah yeah I mean it is funny how he's you know such a
big free speech advocate now that he's buying Twitter and and he really wants when it when it
comes to affecting him personally it's obviously he wants that shit taken down yeah it makes
does it make you wonder like maybe he's buying fucking Twitter to take you out some people say I
mean it's it'd be crazy but like I don't know maybe there's always a chance yeah who knows yeah I
always wonder dude I mean a lot of people talk about you know Elon you know he's obviously the
smartest guy in the fucking world he's done more than anybody he's like a genius when it comes to
some of the things that he's done and accomplished but you know is it's like is he doing this all
for just the better you know to better human beings and the better our our evolution as a
species or is this all just a personal thing to him and he's just like playing it off like he's
trying to better humanity I mean I think he's trying to do better like you know he wants to
go to Mars and stuff yeah he's like Teslas and all that did you see the um that documentary on
Netflix about him starting starting SpaceX isn't that on Disney plus it might be on Disney plus
I saw it on Netflix I think it just came out recently where it shows like there was two on
Netflix too that were like the new astronaut uh the spaceflight or whatever I feel I mean I felt
like my initial thoughts on that was like before I watched that documentary I thought like wow this
guy is just you know some super genius who wants to go to Mars but then after watching the documentary
I realized no this guy I mean I this guy is just a fucking entrepreneur who saw a opportunity to
make a ton of money because they ended the NASA program yeah so without him right now we would
have still not been going on our own rockets to the space station right but uh Boeing or ULA is
supposed to be doing it too right now but they're always behind they're like supposed to be doing
what SpaceX is doing too because Boeing and who ULA who I don't even know either launch alliance
okay yeah so basically the Boeing and ULA are nowhere near SpaceX well they're having problems
they launched it once and then it didn't it had like a timer issue and it didn't reach the space
station oh really wow I mean it's insane how much money he spent you know with the first three rockets
that blew up and then running out of money and then trying to borrow money to get the last one to go
and it working I mean the store is fucking mind blowing are you uh are you then um recently
this morning he was saying stuff about his twitter acquisition Elon he was tweeting yeah what did he
say this morning he said that uh it's on hold yeah because of like statistics on the bots or spam it's
only like three percent of users five yeah he said less they said less than five percent yeah
but what you're doing is a bot see now I don't know if he's talking about like bad bots that he
wants to get rid of or good bots what kind of bots would he be talking about like here's my crypto
giveaway here's $5,000 or like under him there's like fake Elon Musk and they're like here's my reward
to you for being a follower like those are spam bots spam bots yeah okay but are those automatic
are those like actual humans typing things under fake accounts and like posting them I think a lot
of those are automated are they really yeah see I don't know like twitter introduced like good bots
and the automated labels like now I have the automated label on elan jet oh yeah yeah yeah
twitter knows there's good bots okay so there but there are there are bots that could be a thing but
does he does he did he make a statement that he wants to get rid of all bots in general see I
don't know he's never really said he had that TED talk and he was like you know we need to get rid of
the spam and the bots I don't think it would be a smart move for him to buy twitter and then
axe you yeah no and there's other bots besides like elan jet that people use on twitter that are good
like what um I can't think of one right now but like hold up there's one where like you can do
like I think it's called explain this bot it's like an AI that if you tag it it'll like reply back
with like a message of what it thinks the tweet above is there's all kinds like cool really
what are you are you doing anything every day like are you constantly trying to like improve
this kind of like bot technology that you're doing or find new jets yeah there's always like
fixes I'm doing like just the other day there was an issue with the map that was being created I fixed
that but otherwise it's automated what other jets are you tracking
um the basis one jet basis uh bill gates and then there's I have quite a few celebrity ones
there's a celebrity account um air force one you can track air force one yeah when they have it on
which is most of the time really what who else has tried to reach out to you about that about
oh mark Cuban mark Cuban yeah what did he say to you oh he wanted to take him down which I took
it down and it was like like he just messaged me that like where well it's been going on for a long
time but like um it's what you mean he reached out to you a long time yeah and you guys have been
going back and forth ever since I took it down explain that story how did that start
like how he messaged me yeah I don't remember how it started but he messaged me
and what do you say he's pretty much the same thing as Elon just in a different way
how much money do you offer you none come on man you got you offer me come on we know
we know nobody cares about his account it's got like a thousand followers mark Cuban
no the the tracking account of his oh his tracking account got you so it's like he said
it could come out to a maths game or whatever oh did he yeah then he was like oh you get business
advice which like I don't really need but whatever I mean who would want business advice from mark
Cuban yeah so basically he just reached out it was like hey can you take it down and I'll give you
just some tickets to him I mean I asked for stuff but like he didn't want to give anything yeah
anybody else no one else has reached out asking you to take it down
well I mean the Russian oligarch things there's like some lawyers that we're trying to say that
their jets weren't related to that person but I think they're trying to just hide like they were
saying that just to hide they were saying that their jets weren't related to that oligarch yeah
yeah okay yeah just in hopes that I would take it off
how but okay so maybe you already explained this and I missed it but how do you attach
a certain oligarch to a certain jet so like it's who it's registered to but what if they don't own
it a lot of people don't own those jets right well yeah in that case you don't know but these are
like registered to their companies whatever it's like Elon Musk is registered to Falcon landing
which is a subsidiary of SpaceX and he's like every even before I started tracking it people
knew it was his plane so he has a a sub company under SpaceX that owns planes yeah so he has two
other planes too that like those charter the employees around the SpaceX sites oh okay and
like I requested the you can request like all the registration documents from the FAA and like
like it's I got the document and it shows like where Elon Musk signed and everything really yeah
that's pretty wild dude yeah what um were you tracking weren't you tracking uh Putin's plane
yeah I mean it it's technically his it's like all the russian state VIP planes so there's
a chance he's on one of them but yeah it just so there's like a there's like a whole bunch of planes
whatever that it's a chance kind of like air uh air force one they have the two air force one planes
which are uh vc-25 there's two of them yeah he's usually the only one that flies on those but he
also might fly in the other uh 757 planes they have so you don't know which one they're on
but I just track have them all on that account now what is that can you explain what the ASB
can you go into more detail on like how that ASB technology works yeah like how did you get a hold
of that technology so like ADSB oh ADSB yeah yeah so that's what the transponders put out on the plane
and it's like mandated pretty much across the world now yeah and so it's like it's basically like a
radio signal like you're receiving your car like FM or AM and like so there's equipment that people
receive around the world that and then that basically gets combined into one big text file
and I can receive that file from the companies and then my program can look at that it's like
it'll be one row in the file where it's like the identifier the speed the altitude the
longitude and latitude for the location and all that then my program I can tell what to do with
that okay so your program just like picks out a certain line in their code yeah and then you have
like a fire of the plane that I want and that and that depending on what that line of code says
that like automatically fires off a tweet holy shit that's that's ADSB what is this colorful picture
can you close that little ad that hey dude add on the bottom
yeah right there a click close on the left oh on the very left I'm sorry top left of the ad
of the ad box yeah right there sorry I know it's far away so those are all the planes that
ADSB is tracking currently that's live this is all the fucking dude that's insane how many planes
are in the sky at one time on top of each other yeah but I mean they're pretty far away it's just that
you're from zoomed out oh yeah and they're all at different altitudes yeah so the color is altitude
oh the color you see the bar on the bottom yeah the orange is the lowest the pink is the
or the purple it's the highest oh okay dude that's pretty wild to see how many freaking planes are
now is that worldwide or is that only nationwide it's pretty much worldwide wherever there's signal
from receivers and then there's some people that have satellite dishes and they're receiving
some stuff from satellites for stuff across the ocean wow look at that dude that's so insane
when did that when did they start doing this do you know um so I mean like I don't know when
ADSB first came out but like it all started when the Raspberry Pi came out that miniature computer
and then people were hooking up those uh SDR receivers they were tuning it to the ADSB frequency
then it like started with like Flight Aware and Flight Radar 24 and then a couple years about
go ADSB exchange came out which was not blocking anybody and all those like companies like Flight
Aware and Flight Radar 24 they have to block stuff because they're also getting data from the FAA
and they are they have a contract where it says if you're getting data from us you have to block
these planes that people want blocked so like anybody that owns a plane can tell FAA they don't
want to show up and they're on the thing called uh LADD limiting aircraft data displayed
yeah don't you feel like you you could have got like buddy you could I mean you would
Elon hit you up you could like became buddies with him you could have been like yo Elon let me
come hang out with you for the day let me come work for you let me uh let me be a programmer at
SpaceX or Tesla or something like that don't you like I mean didn't you think about that before
you thought like you kind of had two opportunities you could say no I'm going Elon Jettered or Bust
or I could you know play the the Elon card and try to become buddy buddy with him
yeah I mean I don't I don't know if he like wants that with like he he knows hundreds of thousands
yeah but you got him by the balls yeah you had him by the balls you know you could have you could
have you could have potentially at least I don't know would you ever want to work for Elon that's
I mean does that yeah I'd be pretty cool like SpaceX or Tesla wouldn't that be sick yeah
yeah but maybe you should maybe we should send him a dm from the uh Elon jet account well I
got a new proposal from you oh because you're not following you or what yeah it still won't let me
like it'll show the old messages but it's like unavailable to send to send in you're kind of
like the uh the julian assange of jet of uh private jets uh what is what is the um wasn't
there some sort of like online community that was sort of like going after you yeah like the
elon community the tax is it called like elon tax community I heard there's something called
elon tax oh yeah they're they're being crazy well what's the story with those guys wanting me to take
it down for like I can't remember what but they were like messaging me all the time they're just
being nuts you don't remember what they were saying no that was there's been so much news and
all that yeah hundreds of people contacting me I'm like I don't need to do any deals or anything
like if I'm gonna do a deal it's gonna be with elon you know yeah well who's contacting you every
day what kind of people well I mean like news mostly just like local news yeah pretty much
are you doing every single local no no no you got any big like like companies come like trying
to sponsor you to do or to hire you or to recruit you or anything like that not anything big
nothing big no nothing that you're uh that you like want to take and run with
no so what the hell do you do every day besides I mean obviously you do the interviews and stuff
yeah um well I have a part time with uber jets uber jets yeah what do you do for them uh software
stuff oh really yeah that's pretty cool so uber it's like obviously it's uber for jets I didn't
even know they had that actually I thought I knew it's not the same company though it's a different
company yeah okay and what kind of what kind of software or engineering and coding are you doing
with them uh all kinds of stuff tracking and like how their system works with like how they're
setting up uh flights for customers yeah yeah what what are the uh people at your school think about
you do they all do they all like they don't know it's me but like they know how they not know they
don't know like unless I tell them like they know the story but they don't know me really yeah like
they don't they don't see you on tv every fucking day no that's crazy what about what about your
teachers no nobody nobody knows so nobody what do you what kind of classes are you in what are you
going to school for what are you trying to do like what are you before this all happened like what was
your goal so i you're an it yeah and what like what do you what before this thing blew up and went
nuclear and was all over the news like what did you think like jack sweeney what do I want to
do when I graduate college like what's my kind of software and aviation software so this is exactly
yeah what you wanted to do yeah what is your what does your uh parents say to you what do they say
to you about all this I think it's pretty cool I guess yeah that's what they say that's pretty cool
jack you know you're famous now what do they give you any advice um
I don't know you don't know um it's just all it's just crazy from where it blew up from you know
it's just like two years ago and then it it slowly was growing and it was just like a 10,000 and then
80 how many followers does elon jet have right now like 460,000 I think 460,000 yeah
and how is it growing like significantly every day or is it starting to slow down now or what
um it blew up again when elon said he was buying twitter oh did it really people make there's people
writing articles bloomberg and all that and they mention they mention you yeah it's like a potential
reason that he might be buying twitter yeah they're like um like I I just put out a tweet like oh no
as a joke then there's like articles on it kid who's tracking uh or teen who's tracking uh elon
musk reacts to his twitter bid oh no oh that's hilarious man yeah what a crazy what a crazy
situation what a crazy like thing that you found yourself in yeah ended up I mean it's just did
you ever expect it to turn into such a media frenzy like this or was it just like I didn't
expect it to keep going like because I did the russian thing and that blew up too who do you
want to track next I don't know whoever whoever people want me to because like I saw people
were requesting the rush rush on ukraine stuff for a while for me and like it just I just kept
getting requests for it after they knew about me from elon jet and then I did it and then it started
blowing up and the account grew to like 400 000 too that one the oligarch one yeah really yeah
so you just read you read all the tweets all the responses and you see like everything but you
know some of them and I saw a lot of those yeah where the hell is bill gates flying to
I don't know I don't really pay attention you don't even pay attention you just published
Seattle probably yeah of course and same thing with Bezos same thing with Bezos yeah
both of them have two planes oh the funny thing about gates is his tail numbers are like
uh 18 or 884 WM and 994 WM and that's like or it's 887 WM and so it's William Melinda for the WM
and they're like divorced now and the dates are like when they were married and engaged or something
so the numbers are like 18 or 1997 or 1994 something like that's wild it needs to change them now let
me ask you this can you go back and track previous flight logs oh yeah yeah have you ever thought
about Epstein's plane oh well there wasn't ADSB back then and like this web's uh ADSB exchange
only had history to like a year ago they only started logging oh fuck man if you could attract
Jeffrey Epstein's oh and uh Elon's N628TS 628 is his birthday and T for Tesla and S for SpaceX
so these guys just pick whatever the hell they want for their for their tail number yeah
that's pretty fucking wild man that's really cool what do you want to do like what is your
like what do you want to do next you have any do you want to evolve this into something else or
do you want more of a website so I'm like limited to twitter yeah like what is ground control like
how did you come up with that like what do you want to put a name under it and like a good website
for now it's a definitely a cool name it's a sick name so you want to like have a website or like a
brand that tracks all these jets it does on the web or do you want to do more of like providing
software or coding like aviation coding products for probably a website just a website that tracks
shit yeah so like I need like Elon on the website so it's like it shows it live or whatever like you
know ADSB exchange it just shows all the planes nobody knows what it is nobody knows like what
planes they are right they just see all these planes all these planes and you want to be able
to have like the same thing but like see who's in each plane but that could be like dangerous
couldn't it I mean I guess like couldn't these guys get like whacked or something or someone like
it's like a enclosed field at the airport they're at the FBO and so like even for Elon there's a
head of team that's there like preparing like a head before he even gets there what's that mean
like before he gets there there's a team with a car like a security team yeah oh I see what you're
saying yeah and nobody's gonna like shoot down the plane that's just crazy some crazy person might
you never know dude okay there's like if people wanted to do it they wouldn't need me they could
figure it out yeah yeah I guess I see what you're saying people if anyone really wanted to do
something that bad they could go they could go find this technology on their own I mean like
people like that they're out in the open in like New York like going to the Met Gala and they're on
the streets exiting if there was like a sighting people could do something too yeah yeah now as
you say your dad was a pilot or he's just in aviation he's in aviation he is and he's he
do this like the same kind of thing uh no it's different more mechanic related more okay so he
like works on planes and stuff more like maintenance control so okay yeah he like he's on the computer
telling what other he talks to the pilots and all that and to the actual mechanics on what they should
do this I mean with his background in aviation and all this stuff does it was he at all like dude
maybe I had the maybe this is a little risky like oh no no no no not at all but it like gave me the
interest because I knew about the planes and I knew about like the tracking websites because of him
yeah so you were you were just in you were in the right place at the right time with the right
family history the right interests yeah to be the first person to do some crazy shit like this yeah
that's pretty sick yeah man you gotta hit up Elon again yeah if I could you gotta figure out how to
do it all the funny thing that's uh happened recently is he flew to uh Vancouver for a Ted talk
and you know there's people that of course work at the airport oh that recent interview that he just
did yeah okay Ted talk um his plane was there in Vancouver and there's people that worked at the
airport and they took a picture and they're like Tesla fans or whatever and they tweeted at me and
I retweeted it and then like Elon's team came to whoever the owner was of whoever worked there
and they contacted the person that worked there and they're like you got to take this down or
whatever you can't take pictures and you're like they're threatening to fire him the person told me
the guy that took a picture of his plane yeah really yeah I mean usually in those contracts
anyway when you when you work at like an FBO at an airport you're not supposed to take pictures
anyway oh yeah yeah especially yeah if you're an employee I see what I see how that could be an
issue but it just shows that they're like watching my account yeah he's got a team watching your
account right now didn't you say something about like some of the people around him were trying
to reach out to you to try to convince you to do something so it wasn't him oh yeah yeah so
there was like uh like big people in the twitter community of like Elon and Tesla and SpaceX
and they like kept asking me to like take it down even after after he blocked me they kept asking
me and I felt it was kind of suspicious people DMing you yeah that like I knew who they were but
so your idea is that he basically contacted these people and said hey convince this guy to take it
down so he doesn't can't like like sell me out and make it look like I'm trying to do this because
I'm trying to push this whole freedom of speech thing and I'm trying to buy Twitter and I'm trying
to look like a good guy now I don't want to look like a guy who's like you know worried about his
own his own image I mean it was like people it's like probably like a million subscribers or a
million no I wouldn't say a million followers but they had a big growth and they were like Twitter
are Tesla people on Twitter have you ever thought about like expanding this stuff this kind of thing
out outside of Twitter to other platforms like I mean I put it on Facebook and Instagram and
oh do you really telegram yeah what if you did like a live thing on YouTube would you do that
like a live YouTube video tracker yeah stream on like a YouTube channel yeah I could do that
that would be sick yeah you should definitely do that I feel like people like like a website
though because then it's like more interactive yeah but everyone's always on social media websites
there they're there already and it's and it's like uh it's easier to spread it because like it's way
easier to spread it I mean me personally I don't really like going to personal websites like if I
if somebody if somebody I'm interested in or that it's somebody that's doing something cool if they
have a website I'm more likely to like watch a YouTube video about them or you know check out
their Instagram profile that I'm to go to their website that's just me personally yeah but
um but yeah it's dope that you're doing it on on all those other platforms I think a live
a live YouTube video would be pretty sick yeah just gotta have a place to stream it 24 now can
you actually show like a live animation of where the things fly yeah can you really yeah from that
website yeah do you have merch yeah I do yeah I do do you really yeah what's your website called
again groundcontrol.com yeah but it's like short version of it it's just not the full words so
how do you spell it GRND
wait CRNT
just google it Jordan you'll find it yeah it's on we gotta pull it up on here I want to see what
your merch looks like it's uh Elon like Elon jet stuff and it's like I know how high Elon is you
know he smoked a pot on uh Joe Rogan's podcast yeah I have that picture on there do you really
yeah on the shirts yeah it's on it's on the or you can put elonjet.net and it'll read direct to it
okay yeah we gotta get on this
Elon jet now do you are you gonna are you piping in like the oligarch jets and all that stuff
into the same website and then you could click store on the top just double click the top bar
yeah there you go just click store fly exclusive oh you got an ad running on there okay monetizing
that's good scroll down that's freaking sick

talking to me Tim Dillon was talking to you on twitter uh yeah what did he say I think he wanted
me to come on why don't you do it yeah I think I will yeah I think you should dude that'd be
freaking sick yeah he's a funny motherfucker he's really really popular yeah what what did he ask you

I mean a little bit not crazy amount do you own any nfts um no no but I have crypto I was mining
you're oh you were mining yeah really for a while how long were you mining um a couple months
probably like six months mining ethereum with gpu's or um I think just I was using nice hash just
it was easy but what kind of computers were you using to mine uh I had two gpu's you had two two
gpu's 27 units and 80 okay yeah and uh when did you start doing it back in like October oh October
of last year okay yeah that's a hard gimmick there that's a hard gig to do because uh you know all
the competition with it right now and they say that ethereum's moving to like a ethereum 2.0 where
you're not be able to mine anymore yeah so all the gpu's are becoming worthless yeah but before
it's like impossible I tried doing it too you still can't buy them really they're expensive it's crazy
