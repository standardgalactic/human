Hello world, Michael Dowd is the dirtiest cop in the history of New York City.
In the 80s, Michael patrolled the streets of one of the toughest precincts in Brooklyn.
He also headed a ruthless criminal network that stole money and drugs, ultimately resulting
in New York's biggest corruption scandal ever.
Mike was the subject of the explosive true crime saga The 7-5, where he tells all and
relives his days as a mobster with a badge.
Mike served 12 years in prison for his activities during that time and is widely considered
one of the most corrupt cops of all time.
Without further ado, please welcome the marvelous Michael Dowd.
You fell in love with me over Joe Rogan?
Is that how you guys met, really?
No.
Did you get a lot of attention from the females after your Joe Rogan podcast?
Too much.
Too much?
Too much.
One's too many, god damn.
That's funny, man.
Yeah, I spent the last two hours watching your documentary, The 7-5, and I was blown
away by that, man.
Because that was before my time.
I was born a year.
And I was born in 1987.
So that was quite the eye-opening film to see, especially by that guy, Tilla Russell.
He did some a lot of big projects.
Since then.
Since then, yeah.
Was that one of his first?
No.
He had a couple of, you know, for him dynamic, but they didn't hit it, you know what I mean?
And then I told him, I'll change your career, just sit down and listen to me.
For people out there who don't know who you are or aren't familiar with your story, give
me like a brief background or like a brief summary of where you came from.
I'm here because of the 7-5 documentary, you know, the character in it, who's me, the
main character of the documentary called The 7-5, which aired on Netflix for about three
years and was picked up by IFC early on.
They owned it.
And I think they have it again still now, back in their control.
But I was a cop in Brooklyn in the 1980s when the crack epidemic broke out.
It broke out everywhere and broke out on us, too, on the police force.
We had no idea what we were dealing with.
And so the era that I was a police officer was 82 to 92, and I eventually got arrested
and then the story goes from there.
Ten years.
Yeah.
What was it like being a cop in New York?
Before the crack epidemic.
And after.
Yeah.
So it was a very eerie time because before crack hit, you had the AIDS epidemic hit.
So we went from one epidemic to another.
Now we're in another one today.
We're in this fucking COVID thing.
So as a frontline cop, we dealt with a lot of these issues in the street first before
society as a whole dealt with it.
And you sort of learned as you were going how to handle things.
So it was a thrilling time, to say the least.
Nerve-wracking, you grew up quick, right?
So you went in there as a 21-year-old young man sort of, and then in six months you've
seen more than your mom and dad have seen in their life, unless they were soldiers and
stuff like that.
You were 21 when you joined the police force.
What made you want to join the police force?
It seemed the documentary conveyed that it was like a lot of young guys who had no direction
and they were just like looking for something to do.
Yeah.
Well, it wasn't like there wasn't anything to do.
It was more like looking for leadership, looking for guidance.
Guys in their 20s are fairly immature.
Men don't mature to learn about 60, right?
Some of us still were 65.
Is it 60?
Well, I'm 60 now and she's telling me I'm still not mature, but I'm working on it.
So you had a bunch of young guys, you know, it was like a frat house with guns.
How's that?
Wow.
That's great.
I love that.
Who wouldn't have loved it?
It was a fucking pisser.
But the honest thing is it was dangerous and, you know, so we can laugh about certain things
because it's past, you know, but the unfortunate thing is that we all took our job for granted
and didn't really appreciate our position.
You know, like when you're a soldier, you go to war, you're only fighting for the guy
next to you to come home.
And then as you look back on what you accomplished, you know, from what I'm told, it's the same
thing as being a police officer.
When you're in there in the battle, you're battling for the guy next to you and yourself
and you don't realize the impact you have on society and the city and the people in
general, you know, and that's a big subject, right?
But everybody think everybody's little, right?
We're only one little wheel in the big cog, you know?
Yeah, you were a big part of history.
That was a huge, that was a major part in American history.
That little area right there in New York, that time frame in New York, New York City.
Yeah, it sort of had tentacles into the rest of society for years to come, right?
And like a whole generation of people were decimated by this, including law enforcement,
right?
Because if you look back, and I don't know if you had the time to do any research, during
that time, police departments were devastated by the crack and the money from crack, you
know, by their, by choices, bad choices that guys made because they were exposed to such.
I mean, when you're making 17.9 a year and the guy that you pull over has got 17.9 in
his pocket, you know, with no fucking job, you know, and he's 16 and you're like, and
no license for the car, but he's got a brand new one.
You know, it's just, you say to yourself, what the fuck am I doing?
Like, it's a reality check.
What makes sense?
So, you know, of course we're supposed to do the right thing, but we don't always, you
know, and that's where the 51% good guy or 59% bad guy, and some days they switch sides.
Dude, it's crazy that you survived 10 years doing that through that period in New York
City.
I mean, don't you think?
Don't you ever like be like, how the fuck am I still alive?
I'll give you an example.
How many years?
You did 12 years in prison?
Right.
Yeah.
So I did like 10 with the city and 12 with the feds anyway.
But so I should get a pension, right?

Back to the show.
So I looked at it like so the question was how to be survive.
I put life insurance like so how many men do you know at like 23 and 24 years old that
have like a million dollar life coverage back then.
So I had two policies that were over a worth over a million dollars in case I died.
So yeah.
So and double indemnity was great because if I always hope that if I did die, I died
by an accident because that gave you double indemnity right so then your family would
be covered double.
So that was something a lot of the police officers did.
Yeah because it was crazy and especially you guys that were doing the sort of the things
that I was involved in you know I mean I hung out with the Dominican drug king business
you know so one day you could be you know caviar and champagne the next day it could
be a shootout.
You know you didn't know what was coming from one day to the next and I'm not saying that
there was I was involved in shootouts per se although some of sketchy things but but
the reality is it could have been it could have been.
So I and I always was like worried about you know so one of the reasons I stayed in the
police force to all this was because I had a child and like how do you raise a child
as a kingpin drug dealer it's not like you don't put that on the resume what does your
daddy do you know.
So because at some point I made a decision to really not care any longer about being
a police officer and that was when you know if you see the documentary I drove the Corvette
up to the to the lieutenant's parking spot and said fuck you because I was done like
can you catch me please because I just really should I think I'm gonna be better at that
than I've been a police officer even though I I think I was a damn good cop you know as
far as being able to do the police work you know I was I was a slick I became slick I learned
the street I learned the moves of people I learned to know that guy over there is either
got a gun or he's got a he's holding some dope on him just by the walk and the and the
movement of the head I mean it's just it's just you just know we're a lot of guys in
the police force back then numb to it like like numb to be able to reading body language
or reading somebody like a real like a real New York a real hustler in New York you feel
like that's someone who can get along with anybody that's someone who could talk to anybody
and do a deal with somebody like me like you exactly exactly and that's something that
in uniform right right I mean that seems like something crazy super valuable especially
if you're a cop and you're actually doing your job and you're and you're you know you
you're aware of this skill that you have did the other guys in the police force have this
skill or were they just sort of like come into come to work and well so there was listen
so I guess I alluded to partially before in the 80s there were numerous like hundreds
of police officers arrested hundreds it comes close to a thousand police officers were arrested
from 1990 1985 when crack really started to hit to 1992 close to a thousand cops were
arrested for being involved in drugs but of course you know I was the I was the picture
of the you know the the white Lily Long Island guy that that worked in the Brooklyn police
precinct and you know he was purveyor of evil against the poor people in the ghetto the fuck
out of here the fuck they today train me Christ right right no I mean what you did I mean well
first of all in the beginning of like throughout the documentary I love how the court testimony
is weaved throughout the whole thing it's funny how people love that great yeah you know
what because I'm not a film I so that almost bothered me to see it but I can see what every
single person that I've had an interview with which is probably about a hundred by now have
always said exactly that so the backbone of the whole thing it's great it's it's weaved
through the through the whole and the best part about it to me at least was how matter
of fact and straightforward and honest you were about everything like it's just you straight
up just telling him yes I did this and this yeah well you know what so so the comment
on that is that so like a people ask what was that like you know why were you so dead
pan honest you know I had like 30 federal prosecutors sitting in the fucking room looking
to see me fuck up okay that's number one so if I told anything incorrect or lied or obfuscated
I could be charged with it and on the other side was I've already been arrested and charged
with you know I mean what people don't know when we do these interviews is that I was suspected
for nine murders in Brooklyn okay I didn't do any but the New York Post ran with the
story that they're looking for nine bodies to attach to me and the last thing on my mind
that I'm worried about is a couple hundred kilos or whatever fucking you know two hundred
thousand in cash I at this point I'm still fighting in my head that they're suspecting
me for being involved in nine murders and it was like this is nothing compared to what
these people are talking about so so yeah so so from that perspective you can understand
why it was so easy for them to say yeah I did hundreds of crimes I actually lied I did
thousands and only because I didn't say thousands because my father was in the fucking audience
behind me you know watching me testify so I hope they don't I hope I don't get a federal
sentencing enhancement for not telling the complete truth I mean I felt for you in that
documentary I've you know making the small amount of money that you were making being
a police officer in New York and seeing like you just said seeing all these guys that you
were busting that had you know tens of thousands of dollars on them if I was in your shoes I
probably would have done the same fucking thing I would have been hustling with them
stealing money from them and running around gallivant snorting coke yeah yeah bang and
horse yeah yeah yeah that's what that listen it was that way so but I had I was the face
of it right so everybody has to be the fall guy and I don't lessen my responsibility by
saying that I take responsibility for what I did but you know but most guys got terminated
that then they'd get terminated but my situation was I got away with it so long that they were
pissed and then more so that Suffolk ended up catching me on a wire to my partner's ex
partner's house Kenny Aurel that's the guy who ratted on yeah he put a wire on later
but his phones were tapped and then that's how they got to me he didn't know his phones
were tapped but I knew his phone was tapped I said you fucking tapped and he goes what
are you talking about I said I haven't seen you in sick in four months I said the day
I show up at your house there's surveillance on it now what happened to him he never in
he never even did a day in jail or prison yeah no he I mean when they first arrest you know
when they hold you over he did that he got bail and went home you know but and they gave
him they gave him the plea they gave him the plea option to walk walk walk free cooperate
against him and we'll go to the judge and ask him to give you zero and you know so it's
up to the judge obviously did you ever see him after that happened yeah we made the documentary
together really yeah what was it like being in the same room with him after so so it goes
down like this they asked me if to do it with if he if they would so I wasn't gonna let him
be part of the documentary okay cuz I had a little animosity I would think you know the
guy went and lived his life and had a you know good life for himself kept his pension that
I got him you know he never sent the note saying hey listen I'm sorry good luck you know when
you get out here you know you know I'll take you and your family on a trip to fucking Spain
whatever you know nothing no no like listen I'm sorry I did what I did but and it's not
even what he did it's it's just how he did it you know he was offered this plea agreement
and and all he had to do was take the plea but what he did was he encouraged me to do
further crimes while out on bail and and put this wire on and he tried to encourage me
to talk about my family my brothers my cousins my aunts and uncles like he tried to get it
but a whole basket full of shit to give to the feds you know when the reality is he did
exactly what I did you know of course I would take I would be I'd be lying if I didn't say
I was the instigator but you know I mean you're a fucking grown man you make your own mind
up you know and you know he only had to all he had to say was no and it would have been
done what was it like though when you saw him for the first time after you did 12 years
so I told yeah so I told the director to the Russell I said there's only one way this is
going to happen I said I want you and your film crew at the precinct and I want you to
tell him to meet you at the precinct not me meet you guys at the precinct you want to take a
picture of him in front of the 75 precinct so sure enough that's a 1201 high noon whatever the
fuck you want to call it you know so he come he came down the block and he turned in front of
the precinct and I was standing next to the mailbox and he came over and I just looked at
him I said can he fucking turn white so I came over and I gave him a hug I said hey you know
we're home it's over you know how you doing you know really yeah yeah I mean we're gonna do
and at this point you know we needed him for the documentary in some respects you know and and at
that point you know you miss your old friends you know even though you know it's like a bad
relationship you know we have to be time goes by you know you forgive each other you know say
listen we were young we made mistakes you know so it's it's a similar feeling the only thing
about it is is it I would like to have seen some humility or some you know some some feeling of
compassion for what I had to go through you know so people but people justify what they do to others
by blaming you for what they had to go through right so you know his life was torturous you know
he got three quarters disability pension and moved to say say Pasco County here in Hudson or
something like that or the hill what's the hill spring hill you know oh really yeah so so like
you know yeah and he had to live with that guilt too I'm sure well so so yeah so to relieve that
alleviate that guilt I said listen you know I must have been easy on you he and so you know
he says to me I got him in my car he says to me I'm not I want to tell you the truth Mike I didn't
lose a minute of sleep over this I just wanted to fucking kill him he's in my car I'm driving he says
I'm not gonna lie to you I didn't lose a minute sleep over this you know cuz first of all people
don't know that his name was scummer okay so everybody has like a little nickname mine was
Mikey D whatever they had some other name for me to dock that couple names for me and his name
was scummer so I said to him one day when I was working with him why they call you scummer he
goes I'm a scumbag I said oh okay I get it so that he's not like before I became his pot he was
known as the scummer you know so he was a scumbag and that's who he is so he's true to true to his
word true to his name that he earned when I said to him you know Kenny if you just if I felt as though
you had some compassion I mean 12 years I just bricks I just cement block walls I'd wake up
dreaming kissing a brick you know why that happened I'm in prison kissing brick walls I mean it
happens you know and he's more kiss another dude thankfully you know so in his case he'd turn
over and kiss his wife or fucker you know and I'm kissing bricks for 12 years so like and I got two
kids that grew up without a dad you know so so so so you don't have to feel bad for me for that
but you should have some compassion right say listen it must have been different like not a
fucking like like like wouldn't go in through an empty fucking hole in your head right through the
else's eye you know my holy shit wow so it was a little bit disappointing in that respect but
one of the things that I liked about the meeting was I was in control he tried to be but I was in
control and he would say something and I'd say that's the way you remember it it's not the way
it's that's not the facts you know he says why is it the way you say it's right and the way I say
it's not right I says for 12 and a half years I sat in a fucking prison cell recalling what I did
and what you did and for that 12 and a half years you were fucking your old lady and raising kids
and working so who do you think would have a better clearer memory of those days right you or me
did you spend that most of that time most of the 12 years reflecting on everything that you did and
I would say a good portion of it you know so it was more so that you know and I tried I
tried to like tabulate it and document it I've written it down a hundred times started it and
stopped and started and stopped in fact I'm still trying to get it started and stopped
I'm my life rights are owned by one of these you know organizations in Hollywood and they still
haven't been able to write the screenplay how long's it been since you said you sold in the
life rights or option this is my third fucking time so you know just keeps happening you know
and they still keep can't they can't get to a screenplay so I told him if you come sit with
me you will get it and like like hello you want the story I gave you a award-winning documentary
that's run for three fucking years on Netflix you think you sit with me I'll give you the movie
right I'll give it to you I can give it to you today if you want to sit down you and me I'll
write the fucker I'll tell you right I can't write well I mean I've been talking to my phone
now for about about eight days I spoke into my phone for an hour a day I've got 86 fucking
vignettes where you where you would put the the scenes together yeah I could tell I could tell
from the text you sent me earlier that you were just talking to your friend yeah cuz it was
illiterate right it was new yorkies you figured it out yeah I know how you guys are fucking
crazy people I love the part of the documentary where you said that you took from one of your
first busts or one of your first you basically robbed a drug dealer when you went to his house
you saw the big giant bag of marijuana and you found a couple guns and some and some cash
yeah yeah yeah that was you said you took that money and you went and bought a condo and Myrtle
Beach that was the that was the cocaine oh that was noriega's cocaine hmm yeah that was
mani noriega's cocaine that's what we bought the condo so you you sold us cocaine yeah
where'd you sell the cocaine at I don't remember I gave it to somebody so I don't like I didn't
hit in the street and sell it right right I gave it to my party gave it to oh he gave it to the
conhead guy guy who ran conhead some guy was working in conhead they had a good connect in
oh my god it was the best Peruvian fucking pink flake you ever saw in your life that's insane
I came in and I bought the condo with that money that was noriega's cocaine
really yeah and how much was uh how much was the price of cocaine per kilo 28,000 28,000
then then but it consists consistently went down it ended up down about 11,000 when I got
87 88 89 and it just constantly went down didn't fluctuate was it like bitcoin when it goes up
and down no no it would go it would eventually go up which is why we ended up getting arrested
really how yeah how does how does that make so so cocaine went from 11,000 and it worked
its way up to 15,000 a kilo and it was steady and then what happened was it went from 17,5 to 34
overnight because it was the Easter holiday and columbians are very religious you know
so they don't ship cocaine around Easter they just you know they they cut their fucking movement
back and there was a shortage and maybe a couple big busts happened so the cocaine price doubled
so at that very week that it doubled Kenny and I got into our own little supply business
and it created more conversation we needed to recruit a few people to put extra money up
and that's when the whole story that people don't really know the whole story
is four other cops in the 73rd precinct got involved and put their money up because Kenny
is a cheap fuck instead of coming up with half the money like I did he had to go recruit three or
four guys for 2500 each it's just it's just the way it is right so yeah what do you think what
is your opinion on like all of the stuff you see online today nowadays everybody has a phone you all
you see is like shootings with kids getting shot everywhere and all the stuff with the guy who just
got murdered George Floyd and like all all this stuff that's going on with police brutality in the
news today and compared to what it was like when you were running the streets in New York like what
is your this is fucking Disneyland what do you mean by that this is Disneyland compared to what it
was back then right yeah this is a fucking joke there's no brutality out there today and if there
is it seems like most of the time it's captured on there's somebody with a phone who's filming it
yeah you see every fucking incident today back then it was one every three minutes
and you know I spent the last two weeks with a bunch of rap guys I can't repeat I don't know names
I was with these bunch of rappers and they were all from in my era you know I was chasing them down
the street you know because they were selling crackers and rapping songs on weekends you know
and so but half these guys I ended up running into and they were like it was so much better back
in the 80s and 90s today is fucking it's crazy out there you know because they got their beating
they got their money taken they went home right and they could keep running their business they
could keep doing that fucking thing you know this is them this is them telling me I'm the cop in the
room we're doing a podcast with a bunch of guys smoking ganja over my head and fucking running
around you know blood clot motherfuckers and and and and this is how do you this is how they
they're telling me Jesus it was so much better you guys were way better back then today everybody
gets locked up for nothing you know so I mean this is the this is the guys who took beatings all their
life but they but they were out the next day and and they will live in a life and they weren't
telling on the police and the police weren't telling on them and it was a whole different
society back then you know the 80s destroyed a lot of people's lives because people learned how to
survive in it or they didn't so when you walk me through like what it would be like like a day in
the life of a police officer in the area that you were working and like a day not in just any
police officer's life but your life like how what was like the percentage of crime organized crime
you were participating in and like the percentage of actual police work you were doing okay so I
guess there's two different ways to describe it so there were times when I was just as an ordinary
patrolman which is what I was most of my career I would have two different I had two different
approaches in the beginning I was like a glutton you know I would uh every job that came over as a
drug run I would go on it and and there was a 50 of them a day you know so you'd call the 50 different
drug calls a day so not everyone did you rob at because you know these guys got slipped too they
tried to get robbed you know and then sometimes you would take it because so here's the deal
the police department didn't want you making drug arrests okay so start with that so now you're a
police officer in a crack infested neighborhood and you're getting called to 30 40 50 drug runs a
day if you're not on one you're backing up on one you know so whatever so the point is and we backed
each other up out there pretty well because any minute guns start flying and bullets start flying
out there and it was a violent neighborhood it was violence every day I mean they probably took
we probably averaged five guns a day taken off the street in one precinct alone maybe more all right
so and we averaged about a homicide every day and a half so it and usually it takes 10 shootings to
get one homicide you know but maybe eight to ten eight to ten shootings is one homicide so you're
talking about 2,500 shootings in my precinct and a hundred murders you know so in that ballpark
you know my numbers are up right now but in that range how many how many people are you arresting
none you were never you never arrested anybody I made 43 arrests in 10 years
that's it I made I made 36 of them in one year 36 36 felony arrests in one year
and then after that I was done and after that for the rest of you for the remaining nine years it
was like 10 more yeah maybe less I don't know that's wild that was done I was I was done I was
you're getting trouble making arrests so I found out another way to make money
making arrests was a big money maker you know every every time you can arrest you usually you
get overtime right so a cop goes from making at that time I guess I was making if I say
$23 an hour I went up to making $36 an hour so and most of arrest work is paperwork and
drudge work but it's you know paperwork it's court appearance it's it's in the DA's office it's
transporting a prisoner so you know now your body's body ended your body's you hate each other
by the end of this because you are you're with this guy the next 16 hours okay you and your prisoner
really you're hanging out for the next 16 hours yeah together so if you make an arrest you're
basically just now you with your pal wow you went from fucking running somebody down knocking him
over the head to giving him a hug and buying him a beer or something that seems like a pain in the
ass seems like a waste of time why I mean why are the cops why does the cop well that's how it was
I'm telling you how it was and it's not necessarily that way but I'm hearing I'm hearing today that
it's sort of back to that again really because the volume of arrests and the backlogs in the system
and you know in the no bail because the guys they don't they don't post bail they're back out they
get arrested some guys got arrested seven times in three days in three days you know I mean they're
back out in four hours so I mean so from what I understand it's really out of control right now
but I'm talking about from my experience that's what it was so an arrest equals money so if you
don't make an arrest you know I found other ways to make money what was it like so the first time
you started working for there was the one guy who worked in the grocery store what we're overlooking
is the fact that the police department didn't want you making drug arrests and you became the armed
security for the drug dealers make sense what do you mean why didn't they want you making drug arrests
because it costs money interesting they only worried about money it's a city it's a municipal
organization they're worried about money huh so every time they made a drug arrest for a crack dealer
or a marijuana dealer at the time or heroin dealer at the time I took myself off the street
I made 17 hours over time I put one guy in front of a judge the guy in front of the judge he got
bailed out you know four you know a day later and cycle repeats itself so at the end of at the end
of the week I could make I could have made five drug arrests at every you know one a day because
once you once you make one you off the street you get it right so they didn't make the arrest at
the end of shift because then you get over time the whole the whole run okay so what did they
want you doing if they didn't want you making drug arrests just be visible just to be visible be
visible so that the homicides would stay down and summonses okay and make sure you write your book
summons yeah so I used to write him to benjamin ward he was the commissioner at the time and
when did all this change when did this I mean at some point there was a a huge push to get
everyone that was dealing crack or coke off the streets right yeah so um so there was an
there was a time when they executed a cop Eddie Burns the drug organization in Queens
executed a cop by um he was guarding a witness's house and I could be wrong on the year it was
either 86 or 88 I don't remember quite but so on the back of that the PD and the feds teamed up and
they put a joint task force together and went seriously after the crack organizations in Queens
specifically it was it was odd though because they actually went after the crack organization in
Queens but not those in Brooklyn or Manhattan or the Bronx you know because because they executed
this young cop who was sitting there guarding the witness um so that was where the push came from
and what happened was the fed stepped in and there's new laws that they're all complaining about
that Joe Biden put in place back in the 80s and 90s those laws kicked in and the feds began to
enjoin arrests by city PD so the city PD and the federal the federal uh officers worked together
so that they would take him from city prisons to federal prisons so that began to I mean when I
hit the federal prison system in 92 there was 46 000 inmates when I left in 2004 there was
190 or 185 000 inmates so the population like quadrupled while I was in the system and most of
those people that came in were young black ghetto crack dealers really yeah probably 100 000 all
arrested for crack for crack just for possession was there any like no no no no listen listen no one
in there is there for no one's in there for the first sale of crack okay right no one's in there
for that in fact they're not in there for the tenth sale of crack what they're in there for is crack
and violence so they would say oh we're gonna let them all out good luck you know I mean you know
and I'm not saying everyone don't I'm just giving you a blanket example you know and then there's guys
in there that sold one kilo of crack to one undercover and they got life you know 22 years
old they got life you know right set up you know never sold a kilo in his life you know but I
they gave him a kilo to sell to you wait a minute this is both fence on both sides here
I've got that anywhere yeah entrapment right yeah it doesn't work in a drug case that's so
fucked up yeah well so what were you what what did you feel like when you first started actually
working for like the head of one of these drug organizations like you you were working for
these drug empires based out of new york right and uh and you were a cop on duty like was there
like a moment like a shift for you like a moral shift where you're just like fuck it I'm just gonna
do this so I was on the investigation already as a young cop for shaking down people and so my
career took some path where it was clear that they were on to me and were trying to push me out
and at what point was this how far in oh I was on I think four and a half years maybe five years
at the time and I went to they sent me to assignment in Coney Island and uh so Coney Island was like
basically were shifting you away from where you're at so that you're not in the same position
to do the same things so you have to get a new routine and and just maybe maybe you'll actually
straighten up and do your job which I did so when I was in Coney Island I did my job and I did
you know you're doing Coney Island you eat hot dogs on fucking Nathan's hot dogs on the on the
boardwalk right so that's what I did anyway and then when I came back from that uh the 7-7 had
broken it was it was a scandal in the 77th the precinct 13 cops were arrested for doing what we
what we were doing so everybody around me left like two went to Nassau two went to Suffolk two
went to Florida one just quit went to North Carolina another guy got arrested for something stupid
you know another guy went to the rehab two guys went to rehabs so I came back from I came back
from Coney Island and there's a lot of stories that I'm just glossing over right now I came back
from Coney Island no one wanted to work with me because anybody that I worked with was gone
one guy went to Key West just and the reason he went to Key West so he can run to Cuba if you had
to get the fuck away I mean this and this is for real so New Yorkers love Florida man yeah well
you know it's the second borough so fifth sixth borough whatever they call it um yeah so so yeah
so uh he he was in Key West or whatever and uh and I'm up in New York and I'm the only one holding
the bag and like they're looking at me like what the fuck man how how are you still on the job
so it was difficult to get a partner and then eventually I worked my way and started to earn
respect to the guys a little bit again and then I ended up working with Kenny Urell and we became
partners so so at that point it turned from being so so what so I took a different approach to
everything but I you know I'm watching the monotony here I'm getting tired of not making money you
know I'm you know I got high mortgage I got four homes you know condo on the ocean you know I got
some bills here you know so so and I lived okay because I had rental incomes and whatnot but the
reality was that I was so used to that extra money who you know when you start bringing in an extra
two three grand a week just to say hello you know so what happened was I met this guy Baron Perez as
you see through the documentary as it works out he was the Auto Sound City guy he owned an automobile
shop where they put the music in and who goes to put these $40,000 $30,000 music systems in their
cars drug dealers because they had a lot of cash to bury and so I would be a friend I was a friendly
side at his at his shop you know because I pulled the patrol car up he'd put a new Benzi back then
they had Benzi boxes I don't know if you guys even know what they are what the folks see I knew
you don't even know what a Benzi box is look it up it's look it up Austin yeah what it is is
back then they would break your window and then break your dash right ruin your dashboard to take
out your radio because the blob punk was a big thing and you know the guys don't even know you
missed this whole thing people would steal your blob punk radio because it was worth $800 whatever
the fuck it was I don't know if it was worth $200 it was worth more than what they had in their hand
right so back then they began to do these things called a Benzi box where you'd put the radio in
pull the radio out so when you left your car you would take the radio with you but what happened
was most guys would take the radio and put it in their trunk or take the radio and put it under
their seat so they'd break your window anyway and go under your seat and get it I lost four okay I lost
four Benzi boxes and four windows does that wait isn't that the thing where the like the face plate
of the radio you could push it and it would come off and you'd like throw it in your throw in your
backpack or something remember that yeah that's the that was the new Benzi that was a new Benzi
that was a new age Benzi yeah so yeah so the whole radio came out you know what kind of I mean
what kind of an impact did the police force actually have on that part of New York like if
were you seeing any changes being made was there any progress was there any kind of like
it was the finger in the hole of the dike you just were holding the fucking water back and really
the sad thing is the truth of the matter is the cops could have handled it all but we weren't allowed
and you see does that it's a repeating theme you know the cops could have handled it all but you know
the cops job is to be you know a politician or you know a nice guy you know so the heavy-handed
cop would get in trouble like any other time did things thank god they weren't fucking on the
camera back then because there'll be a lot of 80% of the force would have went to jail back then
okay straight up what do you mean you said you guys if they were to let you you could have fixed
what do you mean by that well because we weren't allowed to make arrests and you know there's ways of
there's ways of convincing people to move on or stop and it was not so being a cop is not
necessarily what people think it is okay so I know you're standing on that corner it's fucking
snowing out it's 2 30 in the fucking morning and you're out there with your three friends
what are you doing I know what you're doing you know I know what you're doing but I can't do anything
do you get it I mean this goes this is how it is so I mean because there's no reason for you about
the what you're fucking back then they had igloo whatever those they had they had the fur around
the fucking collar oh yeah and they came out like this I like an eskimo eskimo thank you for the word
they had the eskimo hats uh and and coats on and they'd be there for the whole I think they have
shifts they had a shift and they change shifts when we change shifts so it was like perfect they
oh why don't I do the 4 to 12 yeah I got the 4 to 12 so you know all right let's well I'm out of here
when I'm out here nothing I can see you got it boss I mean that's what I would tell them
because I would go to the bodega sit down and have a couple cold ones and eat you know was this
before after the pimps were running the streets in New York this was after right that was the 70s
I think yeah that was the 70s yeah oh yeah crack took everything over everything of course it was
very violent and very very lucrative so well crack I mean cracks basically the same thing is coke
right it's just it's just cooked with some bacon soda or something like that yeah I don't know I
never made it never tried you never tried smoking crack really yeah I always said I was like I would
like to try it once just because I've seen so many movies about it like what's his name
waltz tree yeah that won't kill you
might need you out right in the dick somewhere because you need more watch yourself wasn't there
an NBA player who died yeah Len Baez that changed the world how did it change the world that was
before my time right when Len Baez died he was he was he was drafted by Boston Celtics right so
this is where it becomes interesting Boston Celtics who's in charge of the Boston area Kennedy
right the Kennedys run the Boston whole area the Montes vineyard shit and all that stuff so when
Len Baez smoked on that crack and killed himself he never got a chance to play the best player in
you know best player at the time drafted never played one game for the Boston Celtics
Ted really drafted number one number one yeah Ted Kennedy came up with these laws these crack
laws and said we need to crack down on the crack laws and these crackers and these crack babies and
all this other shit so he went haywire he put these laws in place which which did a great job I mean
five years later after Julianne took over you can walk in Manhattan on like Disneyland you know
42nd Street was clean everything was clean so the crack laws eventually did their job the problem
was along the way the crack laws alienated a lot of people and a lot of people got burned by crack
itself including myself you know it was part of my demise was the money from crack in the street
right and the the crack laws specifically were basically if you got busted with crack it was
way worse of a prison center or jail sentence but yeah but not in the city right not in the city
but in the feds so that's how it became effective Ted Kennedy was a federal uh federal um senator
senator from from Boston area Massachusetts so he and Joe Biden in that crew put together these
vicious crack laws to help clean up the cities and it did it's just when it cleaned it up it was
they were vacant really Joe Biden was around back then oh yeah he's still around there is he
he's still he's barely hanging on now and then when did that start changing didn't it didn't
Obama start trying to roll that back and try to yeah you know what it was uh and so so to his
credit he tried but the reality is Democrats are always considered weak on crime right so if he was
able to pull off what he wanted but he wanted everybody to freak because clearly he's still
running shit you do know that right he's still Obama he's running this yeah see he's running
this right now so so what happened was they they didn't want I thought it was goddamn Nancy Pelosi
no no he's running this they didn't want um they didn't want Trump to be the the the guy who cleaned
up their drug mess their drug penalty problems so every so every time Trump wanted to introduce
something they would not they wouldn't go for it because they didn't want anything positive on Trump
so he had he ended up doing executive order to promote it what he called pardon this one pardon
that one he was pardoning these people and he did change some of the sentencing laws and and
what happens is people don't realize is that most sentencing laws of their oppressive sentencing
laws but they're designed for a reason they're designed to make you want to tell on me okay
and that's what this the that's why the laws were designed they where they were so and every person
is given that opportunity at some point usually not all but usually most individual given an
opportunity to cooperate in Kenny's case he cooperated without going to prison he cooperated
stayed in the street put a wire on against me and then you know so he won but anyway um so
that's why the laws were designed the way they were so they were very heavy handed in their
sentencing and they would bring so one of the one of the things was they they wanted everybody to
be arrested that was the federal goal to arrest every person selling drugs it's the best idea
they could come up with and and that and that was their approach so if you came to if you got
arrested by the feds or city in the feds joint task force you if you brought in 25 of your best
friends you would get a two-year sentence and each one of your friends would cooperate against
each other and they'd all get five-year sentences so you'd win get two they get five and then they
could go home if they didn't cooperate they got 50 so so they all fucking turned on each other
and they yeah and they filled the fucking prisons up and they cleaned the city streets out
and then most of those guys came out and they they got the hint you know they they get the hint
now if you did a one to ten if five repeated you know whatever but the fact is when you sit down
for eight ten years fifteen years stretches you know you're just tired you just you know they beat
you out they beat you down and they and they did that to most of the people and if they and if they
didn't straighten their lives out they know what the next they know they were offered a 45
year plea and they got offered six right so they know the next time they show up there's no offer
you know you're going do you think most of these crimes are most of this violence and everything
would be a lot of people say that a lot of this would be fixed if just all this shit was legal
okay so my my thing on drugs that laws is there should be none
no no drug laws yeah the war on drugs was complete fucking it's a disaster yeah it's been a disaster
more people have died fighting the war on drugs than people that have died using drugs I just
created billionaires in Mexico and Colombia yeah right and I'd like a piece of that fucking money
myself okay I'm not gonna lie to you but I don't but I'm not you know not allowed so you got your
fair share Mike okay well that's what they say but I came out broken you know really you didn't
stash any before you got locked up well you don't you don't think you're gonna get locked up till
you do you know four houses in a condo on the ocean use a lot of cash laden to them things you
didn't bury any cash anywhere it's a little bit so so what did you actually get charged what was
your actual charge was it was a rico yeah I was eventually charged with a rico statue but that
would that consumed or subsumed or you know contained the actions throughout my career so
so when I walked in they offered me a plea agreement for 24 to 30 years I said what the fuck
this is what you just get it I walk into prison they've been arrested in my life right I was a
pretty good kid you know I walked in I was offered a plea for 24 to 30 years and I'm like
are they fucking serious like my lawyers I calm down you know this is just the first I said just
the first offer 30 fucking years I mean who did I kill of course a month later they put a story
about me killing nine people but anyway which I didn't but so like can you imagine like you're
facing 30 fucking years I'm like what did I do you know I took some fucking money at that time
I was 31 yeah I took some money from some drug dealers so what the fuck you know we just exchanged
we bothered you yeah but you know what I laugh about it now but it wasn't it wasn't a nice thing
that I did I mean you you had one hell of a fucking life and you're what in your heyday you were
haven't you had these drug kingpins paying you what eight grand a week something like that yeah
that wasn't enough basically just to tip him off on shit yeah just basically and half of it I made
up because you had to produce right and what right what do you pay make it look like you're
actually doing something for him right and one time it worked out that I I saved Diaz's organization
one day and who is Diaz again Adam Diaz is the Dominican guy who was introduced to me by
Babin Perez the auto sound city guy who ran the auto shop where all the drug dealers would go
to his shop how big was his organization at that time and what and how what he probably had 30 men
working for him he had four stores that he sold out of only one I knew but actually two so so
these guys were selling what just coke no they had three different spots he just sold cocaine
he saw so he sold four four five yeah he so you go to the growth so if you see the movie you could
come to my store you can get people in again you can get pampers you can get a kilo you can get
anything at my store his both daggers were very successful too you can buy some Cheerios Cheerios
yeah but he yeah but most of his was weighted he distributed mostly weight you know but he had
one or two spots because everybody likes you know the lower you go on the number the higher the
profit margin is so he had one or two spots that sold eight balls and stuff like that which I didn't
know about until if I had known all I if I had known all I found out because when you get when you
get arrested you get all the documentation from the case I was tied into his case and I got all
the documentation from his case you know he was pulling in 100,000 a week in profit just in profit
if I had fucking known I get 20,000 a week what the fuck I mean I'm risking my freedom so is that
the way most of the coke dealers worked in the city back then is they just basically had a couple
grocery stores and they would sell coke out of the back bodega's were the way bodega's yeah
because you can go in right legitimately welcome to a business and instead of hand the money off
at the register you went to the back of the bodega and handed them a you handed a shoe box full of
you know 20s or 50s or hundreds whatever it was and out 15 minutes later down down they had
hatches and shoots they had you know like you go to the bank and they have this thing that sucks
I don't know if you yeah the tube the tube yeah they're the same thing in the fucking bodega
really yeah that's why and everyone was buying like like large amounts well that's that was his
that this is his thing you know it'd be that's how he sold to like the street dealers right
oh yeah right yeah so he would he would pick up a hundred kilos and sell them in a week
and where was he getting the kilos from um so I didn't get that I didn't get that to that part
of the routine but from what I hear and what he said he got them from large distributors that were
tied to you know the big guys uh columbians like the medellin cartel yeah cartel yeah Pablo and stuff
like that yeah that guy that guy was pretty interesting the documentary he had a very uh
interesting demeanor to him he what like there was like so many there was one scenario where uh
you guys robbed or somebody robbed a store or something like that and there was two there
was two guys who robbed somebody else's store you can probably his cousin's store his cousin's
store whatever and then uh he sent you guys after after them no we went he sent us to rob
his cousin's store because his cousin was robbing him and but weren't they're taking his business
weren't there two guys that at one point in the documentary I remember they're asking him
what happened to these two guys that robbed your store and he was like they're not around
me Franklin they're not around Franklin and coke Franklin and coke yes yes they're not around
anymore what was the story with those guys I don't know they're not around anymore is that part of
the Rico actually I don't think so but let's just say yes I don't know they're not around anymore
but you were the one who tracked who chased them we got them yeah you got them yeah and
they're not around anymore I don't know about that part oh okay yep but I was told they're not around
anymore okay I don't know I don't know but I was told they're not around anymore but I didn't have
anything to do with that part of it oh okay I thought no I found them but I so I found somebody
that yeah I found them he's over here got it and you just told him where they were oh I understand
yeah they're here yeah so that guy was making a hundred thousand dollars a week in profit only
how much time did he get do you know I know I know he did eight years initially
so and he said he wasn't sure he said he was charged with money laundering not cocaine
yeah so I don't know I mean I didn't read his papers but that's what he said
and we've spoken I speak to him every couple days do you really what's he doing now
he's running a laundry mat he's rolling cigars and he's rolling it he's rolling it right here
are you serious what does that say this the 75 great it's a cigar the mind of Brooklyn land of
fuck Brooklyn's the land of fuck is that what it says welcome to the land of fuck
why is it the land of fuck explain that what does that mean okay so in the movie
I remember from the movie that term was used yeah so you know that's why we put that on the
t-shirt and the cigar label so is he still in Brooklyn she's still in New York no he's been
deported to dr oh his family has a tobacco plantation in Dominican Republic wow the largest
second lord is Palma Palma tobacco and who's the other guy what was his name Chino Chico Chico

fuck is his name anyway yeah that his name was like Chico or something and his uh his gang
I can I can remember I'm getting old his his gang was called the company la company la
company yeah la company yeah I pulled him over yeah first day you pulled him over after you found
out he put a hit on me he put a hit on me he put a hit on me and how did you how did you find out
that he put it on well first of all he put a hit on me because he showed me 700 hours and um
so I made it made it known that I wasn't happy about it that he should come up with 700 hours
and he said you know fuck you I'm not paying you I said okay that's fine and then I put pressure on
the store for about three days I would park in front of the store I chase his customers I paid
another organization another bunch of cops sit in front of the store for a fucking four or five nights
when I wasn't there and chase him and bother all his clients and then all of a sudden my pager goes
off 9-1-1 you know we had pages back then beepers and it's barren's shop and I said what's up
he doesn't usually page me especially 9-1-1 he says uh you gotta come see me I said all right
I drove in just to see I was on my way to work 4 to 12 and he said to me uh put a hit on you
I said who and he said uh the fuck is that you Chico uh Chino Chino Chino yeah Chino put a hit on you
and um I said I said okay and uh that I turned out my 4 to 12 shift I had this female partner I think
with me and I said to her hold on I gotta pull this car over I never saw this car in my life
but I knew what his car looked like because I was told so I just took a guess this is his car
hit the lights it was near his store it's within a block of his store up by nor would nor would
infult in if people anybody listens nor wouldn't fault him by the elevated drain by the station
the empty where the staircase comes down I pulled him over uh I said license registration he's
reaching like he doesn't know he doesn't know that I want to kill him you know he doesn't know
I want to kill him right now and I'm hoping to see a gun aren't you freaked out this guy's like
super fucking violent yeah let's let's go I'm here so I'm looking in his car and I'm looking
to see if he opens his glove park is if there's a gun in the car I'm killing him really I'm killing
him I'm not gonna what would you do guys just said he's gonna put it on you right so I'm killing him
and uh so he takes he gives me his legs like you know hey what's his my license
registration insurance code I've taken from him and I look at him and I throw it in his
fucking lap I said you put a fucking hit on me motherfucker he looks like me oh my he turned
his white as I don't see it as white as a fucking t-shirt and so anyway so I told him you know
why don't you get out of the car oh my fucking elbow I'm skinny oh sorry yeah would you just
no just my bony elbow um so I said why don't you get out of the car we'll do it right here
you put a fucking hit on me let's do it right here broad daylight you and me I said we'll do a
fucking Mexican fucking walk off let's go shoot out yeah okay corral motherfucker let's go and he's
like I said you call a fucking hit off right now or or I'm coming to see you because I gave him
the chance and he said all right all right all right I left I got my pay my beep my beeper goes
off about 20 minutes later he called up he pulled the hit off meanwhile the fucking precinct no one
never told me the precinct knew there was a hit on me how would they know they got snitches everywhere
bro the feds were in that organization somewhere and they never fucking told me but you remember
the in the in the you remember in the movie Joe this guy detective Joe halls in the back of a van
and they came up the street sweepers yeah well there was a guy in that van that was pointing
out all the organizational people because they it was a snitch for them they knew that they put a
hit on me and never told me that's fucked up well they didn't want me I guess around that's
fucking wild man yeah yeah it's crazy that you at such a young age were able to I mean develop that
that street mentality to be able to coexist with these guys and and work with them and make money
with them and like even how the one guy that runs the cigar rolls the cigars was talking about you
he was like yeah I could talk to this guy and he was just like me like I said a compliment I could
reckon I don't know if that's a compliment well yeah well he's a street guy didn't mean like
he's a New York guy I can talk with him I can I can you know hustle bustle with him and he's not
like a normal cop well it is I think if you show vulnerability and and I mean by that I mean you
take risk like if you take risk people accept you more right so for me to have the balls to come
up to somebody and say you know like I'll give you a funny example I was working in 75 with my
partner at the time his name was Jerry we pulled his car over 280zx maroon back then that was the
hottest cars you know it was maroon or burgundy color to 280zx I pulled him over and I go to
toss the car because I know he's like do you look at that's what that's their car and uh I
tossed the car I can't find it and he's looking at me he's like sweating his fucking balls off I
says all right you're good this time you know and I let him go now I get transferred to Coney Island
remember I told you I got transferred to Coney Island okay so I'm walking to beat in Coney Island
and this Hispanic guy a little short stocky guy says hey Batman and Robin I don't know who to
fuck Batman and Robin are it's me and my partner that's our nickname to them right so I go who's
Batman and Robin he goes well he's Batman because he's taller than me and you're Robin I go okay
what's up he goes you guys are in the wrong precinct so oh oh you're really smart you know
because cops take their numbers from their old precinct and put it on their gun belt so if you
see it back in the day you take you put your new numbers on your shoulder so six oh precinct
because that's Coney Island and I put my seven five numbers on my gun belt I said you saw my
fucking gun belt numbers he goes no you pulled me over in the 280zx I said burgundy he goes yeah I
said the back trunk he goes yeah you because it was a hatchback yeah he said you missed it there was
10 kilos in there I said you motherfucker he says all you have to do is pull that fucking the the uh
the mold there's a like a plastic mold or back it's like a cardboard mold off to the wheel well
he said it was in the wheel well I said you motherfucker Jesus but when you come back to the seven
five I got something for you oh yeah what do you mean by that like like I want to work with you oh
yeah yeah he says I said I said why he said because you never try to lock nobody up you just want
some money so I said you fucking motherfucker you got me right he said we used to call the police
we used to call 911 to see who shows up and when you and your partner were working we knew we were
good for the night this is how fucking criminals work right they would check on themselves and
see who's gonna roll up so anyway so yeah that was that's so that's what it's like you know yeah I
think cops are a different breed nowadays than what they were back then yeah they're different
especially around here I don't know how much time you spent in Florida yeah I mean they're nice guys
yeah they are nice guys I mean fair they're fair yeah they're fair I find them squared away you know
military-ish more on the more on the lines of military than you know that approach to things
you know but you know once you let them let their god down a little bit they're human like everybody
else you know which is which is the truth I mean you know where tomorrow your brother's a cop you
know you know your your uncle's a cop or your aunt's a cop right so you know well your neighbor
yeah it's not it's not a job that I envy I mean especially nowadays yeah with the spotlight
shining on on everybody and all the phones and everything well so so that's funny because you
bring the spotlight I am I was the first advocate of course no one listens to me because I'm dirty
rogue fucking corrupt cop I was the first advocate behind every cop should wear a fucking camera
really yeah every cop should wear a camera well because to keep you honest yeah on those moments
where you because people don't forget human beings put these uniforms on right so it keeps you honest
and and most times cops do the right thing most times like 99 percent of the time they do the
right thing I mean you might not like what they did you might not have wanted to be arrested but
it's an ugly situation in any in any respect if a if a if a patron or a perpetrator doesn't want to
get arrested it's gonna get ugly right so you're asking a human being to do the job of a machine
that just you know that's doesn't really yeah the cops are humans too yeah you know you know you
if you spit in my face I do want to knock your fucking teeth out right right you know I just as
a man right so so you know that guy's is still a man you just spit in his fucking face I mean I
don't know how they do it today he's throwing rocks and bricks and fucking urine and shit at the cops
like I saw a video the other day my father in law was showing my father and I was like a really
he he uh he used to work for one of the big uh this place called SRT around here that sold a lot
of the uh the guns and the body armor to a lot of the local law enforcement law enforcement around
here he showed me a video of this guy charging a police officer the cop shoots him at least 11
or 12 times and the guy's still going yeah and eventually he hits him like the 13th time
and he finally drops to his knees yeah not done not done yet though never seen anything like that
man fucking zombie yeah but um good luck yeah you know I'd be in a cop dude I mean you know how
about the scene we saw you saw the one with the uh the police officer comes out of his patrol car
the young black heavy set black girl goes to stab a girl on the ground oh yeah stab the girl
against the car who's just standing there right and the cop shoots her and he's his come big low
life piece of shit right yeah that's the problem with the internet though that's like like I agree
that that the the the cameras are a great thing because it keeps you honest right it keeps it
keeps you honest and you can't lie about what happened also the problem is that once you throw
that into something like twitter then it's just tribalism at its worst you know what I mean
everyone wants to pick they're like okay before I make my uh before I form my opinion on this
what side am I on well yeah well if you start out on a side then you're really that's the problem
you'll never yeah you're gonna there's gonna be a problem right right so he's just I like picture me
I was a cop so I favor the cops normally but I've been arrested by police officers okay
so I know how to be a little more exacting and judgmental of their actions so you know I always
say that I think I'm one of the better critics of policing and police work so if I'm telling you what
what's going on is correct or it's okay take it from a guy who's been arrested several times okay
and and I didn't like any one of them but you know I did put my hands behind my back eventually
because I knew that I was submitting to be arrested for something that I did you know I'm not saying
I was guilty of said crimes but you know I mean it wasn't pretty when they came to arrest me I'll
just say that much I wanted to fucking kill them I mean yeah I because I they arrested me at work the
first time and then the second time they arrested me I was out on bail and it didn't they storm your
house then yeah yeah and so they did was call me in it's all I did do so they did the Roger stone
me they put the fucking air look up this fucking speed speed boats and every fucking thing else
dogs search lights they beat your ass when they did that they rough you up a little bit
no I've heard a lot of stories about drug dealers get their ass kicked when they get the doors
beat down I had one guy in here saying he almost got he got they'd beat his head to a pulp when
they with a uh this guy who was an ecstasy kingpin in uh Arizona oh I mean you might get a beating
yeah whatever I don't know it whatever it's life they say it's a couple hard knocks here in there
what are you gonna do yeah but if you survived it if you if you comply with them you would
well that's different yeah you would think that I shouldn't get my ass beat no you should I
agree 100% you should not get your ass beat if you comply thank you you're correct it should never
happen do you think a problem is a lot of people don't was he complying huh was that gentleman
complying when yeah I think so okay at least he said he was all right maybe he was that was his
story no yeah no no and he very well could have been because I know some guys that just felt so
amped up like they got to meet justice right here I mean dude this is your job just do just do it
right have the guy say that they treated me like a gentleman so you know that there's nothing wrong
with that yeah that's my opinion um I used to buy them beer and fucking uh chicken there was a guy
I'm sure you know who he is Jaco willing he talked when he I heard him talk about police reform and
and police in the problem and like the police world right now and it's that like he compares it to
when he was overseas uh serving in the marines uh or he was a navy seal or I think he was a navy
seal or a marine anyways he would say like when they would go into these foreign countries or whatever
their job was to basically integrate with the system with the with the civilians and with everybody
and basically talk to everybody figure out what's going on and basically be like a communication
hub for them like talk to them be friends with them and try to like solve or complete a mission
so for example if it's a crack infested neighborhood the cops should what well I don't know I'm just
asking what I have no fucking clue right right so we they we have that yeah we've had that we have
we call community policing we have um but outreach offices yeah school offices right the problem is
is never enough right you know and and and the real world is dangerous it's not like a book
you know because the one guy that that that's running the neighborhood's drug spot wants to
make the money and new people don't want the traffic that he's bringing right but if he knocks
off one or two of your neighbors everybody shuts the fuck up it starts to get real well they say
it's nothing like getting punched in the face when you walk into a ring oh this is a real fight
you know right so things change you know we'll let practice practice is over now yeah I think
I mean he was talking more about he was talking about like like be like befriending people and
trying to get people to trust him especially in those communities overseas and in these foreign
nations like Iraq like Iraq and Afghanistan or whatever and you know you compare that to I mean
the faint the most famous incident I think is like the Trayvon Martin incident where you had
the X-cop walking down and the kid the kid was walking to the the grocery store he's walking to
a house or something like that in Florida was that yeah in Florida yeah yeah he was like chasing him
down like hey what are you doing the guy was the guy was a civilian an armed civilian right with a
little bit of uh I think he had a peace officer status I'm not sure yeah forget forget yeah yeah
anyways I think the point is I think the point he was Jocko was the guy the guy listen the guy the
the guy did nothing wrong right he just overstepped his bounds who the guy who shot him yeah right
he overstepped his bounds he overstepped then they got in a fight they got a tussle right and
that's it you're done now now I'm killing you you're getting shot yeah that's that's unfortunate
he made a mistake then Trayvon right the other guy didn't the mistake he made was confronting
Trayvon you just let him go and call the police that's it right that's why they have 9-1-1 but
the fact that he got involved at that point it's the kid would still be alive if he wouldn't
if he didn't fight with the guy and just said okay I'll comply wait for the police to come
right exactly I mean he might have been the nicest guy in them in America yeah but when someone's
armed and they're making a citizen's arrest they have a choice to protect themselves too and he
was tuning this fucking guy up don't get just oh yeah he was getting tuned to fuck up this 17 year
old kid whatever he was he was beating his ass he was beating the fuck out of this guy and guess
what if I got a gun on me that means it's your gun now so I ain't giving it up yeah but you
instigated the shit you started the fight motherfucker and now you're getting your ass kicked
but now you're gonna kill the kid no no you're gonna take my gun and kill me that's all that
matters now you beat my fucking ass now you're gonna take me and shoot me with my own fucking
gun that's the problem that's where the problem is yeah I don't know yeah well that's what I'm
that's what I'm telling you okay that's the problem the problem the problem was he overstepped
his bounds and stopped Trayvon instead of just calling the police and said he just ran through
the back door over there whatever you know after the police confront them instead of doing that when
he stepped out there and tried to be a citizen police officer Trayvon now his actions ended up
causing his death the other guys actions caused the incident Trayvon's actions caused his death
because if you're getting your ass pummeled by somebody and you have a gun it becomes their
gun do you do you not connect that okay so that's that's the that's why he was deadly physical force
to stop him so what's cool no retreat law or something or you don't have to retreat or you
don't have to fucking get your dick blown off if you know if the guy's fucking got you down and
choking you out you let him kill you yeah right yeah I guess the the fucked up part is like what was
the reason he was chasing the guy down you know the guy didn't do anything wrong he just looked
suspicious to him oh my god so he should like like I said call the police don't confront or
try to talk to it you know even like confronting him yeah in front of at least maybe try to
communicate like verbally yeah I don't think it was working with Trayvon he was sneaking around
you know I mean he wasn't trying to talk to the guy like hey man what's going on what are you up to
like what what are you what are you going what's going on yeah I don't know where you had it you
know what I mean like like like like I feel like advanced communication skills or even well this
guy isn't a cop too yeah this guy's a civilian who has a little I think he had a little training
as a peace officer so he's not a local cop he's has a little training so now he's got a gun
and now he's put himself in a position to be the hero and now he's a fucking zero and someone's dead
so I mean but that's life you know that you know if someone burglarizes your house of course right
and they're in there doing a good job on it and you go to stop them and you they start tuning you up
and you know you reach for Uncle Sam under the fucking drawer and you fire a shot at him
you're probably gonna get arrested you're probably gonna get arrested but but should you right I think
the point I'm trying to get to is when I originally brought it up was like Jaco was saying to become
someone that he was to become a Navy Seal you have to go through what's called Hell Week
which is basically the most brutal fucking training that is created to break humans right
and if you if you want it bad enough to make it through that you can become you can get this job
right right right so is that every cop should do you think so is every yeah every cop should
do every kind no I'm gonna tell you his demands I'm gonna give you the answer his point was they
should go through more or they should have to want it more or they should be more okay so good
he's I'm gonna give everybody an answer that I gave people 10 years ago 15 years ago 20 years ago
now send them to prison first what's that gonna do send the cop to prison first start them out
in prison then who the fuck wants to do then no one's gonna want to be a cop well we're gonna
have no cops Mike we don't have anything like that start a cop out in prison if he makes it through
a week of prison he'll understand what it's like to violate someone's rights he'll understand what
it's like to the severity of putting a handcuffs on somebody and me so for a cop to put the handcuffs
on you it's nothing for him it's his job but what he's just done is change your life irreparably
maybe forever and he needs to understand or she the magnitude of the decision that they're making
and what they're doing to somebody because watching someone's family grow up through pictures
as you watch them watch their family grow up through pictures could sort of put a little
sense of humanity into what you're dealing with because cops often don't see humanity when they
see a criminal they see a crime and they treat that person in a relationship to the crime that's
committed so someone shoots somebody and kills them they're a murderer right but maybe they just
defended themselves well maybe last week the guy raped his daughter or tried to fuck his mother
and so on and so on and so forth so so now you're just saw someone shoot and execute somebody
but you know what is he really that bad of a human being you know the guy who's had his
daughter on his lap but he's trying to fuck his daughter yesterday you know so how bad is this guy
today yeah no i mean everybody more when you bring morality into it and and reason for putting
someone in prison obviously you know there's going to be nuance but i think when it comes to
like how experienced you are how trained you are and and whatever it is with with using weapons
or defending yourself and if you've never done it and you get into a fight with somebody right
you should be able to fucking win the fight without having to blow someone's head off you know
you go ahead and fight uh what's his name that just knocked out 12 people with one shot you know
who was that or the guy from miami the mask mas mas the vow go ahead and oh yeah go fight nice
the vow trained cop good luck all right if you don't have six of you you got a problem all right
so yeah so yeah and all cops should be better trained yes i agree but you gotta understand
they're trying to turn cops out at a rate in it in 22 weeks they're trying to make you a cop okay
yeah so in that time they're teaching you law social science i don't know vaginal work whatever
the fuck they put cops through today i don't know whatever i don't know if you're supposed to be
medical doctors you you know you're fucking teach people how to breathe you know get laid i don't
know what social work is so so all the stuff they gotta learn in the next 22 weeks and then
you gotta teach them how to be an expert fighter have at it you know i mean and don't forget these
are these are people that are getting paid a salary by a city good luck we're at at the end of it
we're gonna attach a gopro to you good luck yeah have at it you know i mean while you still 103
pounds the fuck you know you're five foot four you're 103 pounds you gotta you know you gotta
22 inch where you're a dime piece but people want to fuck you but you can't fight your way out of
what paper bags mean i'm sorry you know not only that we're gonna pay you little fingers not only
that we're gonna pay a 40 grand a year yeah right so let's go see what happens let's see how it turns
out yeah so yeah so there's uh there's a lot of reality that does a lot of good luck yeah i mean so
it would be it would be nice if cops would get more self-defense classes i would say
if they spent 40 percent of their time in self-defense classes rather than all the other
shit they deal with um yeah my friend jimmy you want to answer it no okay tell him i'm
yeah um yeah so right was jimmy in the documentary no no he's got his own documentary
he's got his own documentary actually he was at a wedding for the Blanco the Blanco
Griselda Blanco yeah he was at their wedding the other day and uh he presented them with a painting
from Maserati how do you say his name Masachi yeah yeah Jimmy Vegas we call him Jimmy Vegas
because he's from Florida no he's from he's from Ohio moved to Florida then moved to Vegas so for
some reason his name is Jimmy Vegas and uh but he's he's pretty talented artist and uh so at Blanco's
wedding this week yeah this week which Blanco is it you know the guy the the son the son of the son
yeah wow yeah he had a big wedding and he's got a reality show does he really he's good i don't i don't
i'm so out of yeah i don't know he's got like five million views every week on on a reality show on
tv and then he at the he got married and in the wedding on tv he was a real wedding he really got
married he presented them with one of his pieces of art for um their wedding gift jeez yeah so it was
pretty interesting some interesting characters out there you know we've burned into a lot of
different people right so that's pretty fucking wild yeah it's pretty cool when did uh at what point
did uh tiller what's his name tiller Russell yeah at what point did he reach out to you and
then say he wanted to make this movie about you yeah so i was the 2012 okay i was at that time i was
home eight years you're already out yeah yeah i was home eight nine years eight years and uh so
uh i was in the car the girl i was with at the time her phone rang some guy she thought it was
my book agent i go what the fuck does he want he's he hasn't got me he hasn't got me uh a publisher
yet to do the book or writer and uh so it turned out it was i thought it was i thought it was jeff
schmidt it was it was it was uh tiller Russell and i go who are you and how the fuck did you get this
number like it's not even my number how'd you get this number and and uh it's funny because he would
go on to repeat that same verbiage that i used on him the next four people he calls said the same
exact thing he said they but they all followed it up with one other thing what did mike say
so yeah so he calls up and uh he flies in from la and he meets me and i put him in the car with me
and i drive him around and just telling some stories and i said if you do what i tell you
you're gonna have a real fucking you're gonna have good fellas in police in the police department
i said this would blow good fellas away if you do it right of course it was a documentary it wasn't
a movie but uh so he goes oh really i said yeah so he goes tell me uh tell me tell me so i run off
a few stories and he's fucking got jizz falling off the side of his fucking mouth and he's on the
phone with the this guy elie holsman in la he says we got a fucking star and i'm like what we got a
star elie are you are you listening to me yeah he goes i go who's the star he goes you i said
what do you mean he goes we've been working on this documentary for six months already i said what
i i said and you came to see me at the end he goes well we've just changed the whole thing
just now i go really so then i i helped them just they retooled their whole project
they spent a half a million dollars they spent a half a million dollars and documentaries don't
spend that kind of money but in this case they already had a half a million dollars in and then
after meeting me they said forget everything we fucking did forget about it we got it all do it
all over then they had to reach out to the producers for more money and they went on and they
put together and so so here's so so the 75 documentary was put together it sat on the
shelf for almost two and a half years they're just trying to get it right and they fucked it up
fucked it up they fucked it up and they had guys like um well i can't get all the names
p diddy and all these guys they would meet and they in a video like in la they do trial runs in
front of people in the industry to see what they yeah what they thought you know it's like a focus
group yeah exactly and so anyway and they will help each other out by doing it and so anyway so many
many people had seen the rough draft and they they had it three hours at that time they were looking
at it three hours at that time so one of the one of the guys and i could be saying the wrong
name so i don't want to say that the names but one of the guys was in the industry turned around
and said more him and less the others okay me me so i guess so ps so they cut it down to an hour
and whatever 40 minutes and uh and um i was amazed by it but they did a really good job and but there
was 158 versions 158 full-length versions of the 75 oh my god that's a lot of fucking editors a lot
of fucking work in that thing so i'm really disappointed that but there's probably i would say
there's probably 156 better ones than the one they let go really because the shit on the
cutting room floor would make your hair stand up yeah so it was in fucking credible yeah who ended
up buying it i fc uh all three media produced it with some financing from others and uh they sold
it to i fc that i fc which is a shit organization ended up i fc yeah they independent film company
they're they're part of amc okay they're the subsidiary of amc they put no money into promoting
it zero really like they put ten thousand dollars in the budget to promote it i did all the promotion
basically and um so it didn't it seems dumb it should have been it should have been uh should
have got the award it should have got the academy award for the best documentary yeah it should
yeah no it should have 100% should have not because i was in it not because i was it was great
no it should have incredible story it should have got the what happened was it got lost in the small
film festival in manhattan it didn't make it to sundance and then after they after they agreed
to to take it uh this this little small shit for showing in the west village sundance called the
next week and said we want it and they said well we already committed i'm like fuck that sundance is
where you want to they said listen you can't get a bad name in the industry if you're back out of
these little film festivals i don't give a fuck about the next film i care about this film whatever
i got no control you know right so they didn't go to sundance if you don't go to sundance you're
not getting the fucking you're not yeah that's what i'm gonna let these fucking nerdy little
industry cucks kind of try to dictate your if you would have if you would have been in
look motherfucker i was the one making all this money dealing with on streets like if you want
someone to sell this thing it's me motherfucker and i'm still selling it i'm still selling it
and what the fuck are they doing nothing nothing nothing fucking god damn shame they're fucking me
are you at least getting paid no i got it from them are they paying you i'm supposed to get paid
if today they haven't turned to profit they said for three years on netflix they haven't turned
to profit yeah that's the problem that i think that that industry i think the big film music
industries television industries they're all they're all corrupt they're on their way out right
well they're corrupt they're corrupt they're on their way out because they fuck over artists
they fuck over talent right and they're infamous for fucking over talent there's tons of go to
netflix you watch a thousand documentaries like that that expose music industry the film industry
the tv entertainment industries for doing this and because of that because of all this light
being shined on it they're on their way out now like people like you artists talent people who
have great stories they're creating their own platforms on things like youtube or anywhere
else they tell it and then and they build their own platform right and the audience is what dictates
right what they do yeah well this is what i'm working on right now so we'll see what happens
it's just it's tough when you're a solo band you know you you know i'm not together with the other
guys doing it you know if if if i could get on board with each other and we could pull up funding
and and maybe we can do something bigger together but you know you're doing something like this just
to talk show no well this is this i would just i'm listen i'm gonna do i just i i want to have it
i don't want to go half cocked okay i don't want to do a studio or a podcast that's lacking i want
to have everything in a podcast that that you have a podcast you know i want to have a guy working
in with me in a booth booth i wanted to editor i want the cameras i want the system set up i don't
want to go like off the phone like some people do and just have i just don't i want to be real
you know i want to want to be impactful so yeah a lot of people say that i've had a lot of guys on
here that say that and it's it hinders them from getting started it does it does it has
i actually was involved in a short podcast that was set up like this for about six episodes was
called the mic and mic show and it really was very good because i was i was a big part of it and
it was a good good feed off the guy that i was working with he was basically the straight man
and uh and i had like five or six episodes we did and uh and was it like a like a like one of those
edited podcasts with music where it tells a story or was it no no it was just him and me kicking it
talking about the day talking about the day and it was pretty it was pretty great really yeah we'd
talk about the day and then we i do some analogies from synopsis from my past and connect with today
and tomorrow and and just just kicked it you know and talked about you know the air conditioning
unit not working oh yeah you know i i plugged one up you know i don't think the air conditioning
is working in here it's hot as fucking right now yeah well uh where can people all the listening
or watching on youtube where can they find your uh are you what are you pushing so right now i'm
just doing i'm really just uh so i have the cigar line that's that's been still available it's just
i haven't i haven't uh what it is is there's some issues getting stuff from the dr to here because
there's a very high tax so but you know if people were interested in getting some cigars they can
contact me through instagram twitter or facebook you know the mic down on instagram and twitter
and my d o w d d o w d yeah uh or um michael down on facebook and stuff like that i'm really not
pushing much right and right now i'm looking to get my screenplay done uh and i'm looking to get my
author my book done i i i've almost had it done three times now it's really getting exhausting
what's stopping you what's what i've had i've had i've had the set with authors three times and to
write it out and the first off the absconded the next off the was no good we went to a meeting with
all the top publishers and we didn't get the deal done and then uh because he wrote it like a fucking
cunt anyway uh uh yeah he wrote it like a bitch and and the other guy uh who's a pretty good writer
he got four books published he's sort of back he's i mean i sat down with him for two months
it's exhausting going over these these stories and and and and and you know reliving them and
the passion and the compassion and the feeling that you know you see how i am i'm just stipulating
all over the fucking place when you tell these because you know they come out of your your
physically these stories yeah so uh and i and i he's got a hundred page treatment written and i
don't know i don't know i don't know so i gotta get the right writer and the right publishing
people behind me and get it done or i may end up self writing it but so yeah so the screenplay
and the book i'm working on i have i own my rights to the book and i own my rights with tv series
