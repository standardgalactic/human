I can't admit, I had my doubts, I'm shocked to my heart, I never expect, you gave your life back from the day
On the road to me, on the road to me, on the road to me, on the road to me, on the road to me
On the road to me, on the road to me, on the road to me, on the road to me, on the road to me, on the road to me
I worked for Publix for seven years and I tell my name is Ben and everybody calls me William Ben
On my birthday my boss purchased me my tag and that's the story of that
Heading to my skating place down on the walls in Heminguan and been doing this for a while
and I enjoy it and everybody enjoy it so it's going to be a great day
Check this out
Skating has really helped me a lot since my brother passed, it was the best year of my life when he was alive
and skating took place because we both worked in the roller rink for a number of years
How close were you with your brother?
While we bake cakes, we sing songs together after school, you know, the best thing
and we do play in the snow in Chicago and go to Chinatown taking the L train
and the best is to trip to California with all our friends for two weeks
and that was the best memory
I've grown up alive
He passed on the way to Chicago for Christmas, December 22nd, I got the phone call at 7 in the morning
I was ready to just end it all and I was in a subway and I was thinking all that
and actually I know the train stopped right in front of me and door opens and there's two nuns
sitting right there and looking at me, it's like a miracle
I told them what I was going through and they helped me, they stopped me from doing bad things to myself
I would say that it was like a miracle that God feels what I feel
and he sent two nuns to stop me
and after that I realized, you know, it's time to go on and pack my bags
and got in my car and went to Florida
Years ago, when I was in Chicago, when I was working the roller rink
and I was doing the spin and my right skate slipped and I sat on my ankle
I found me an ankle support, so ever since then it's a must for me
and if you think your ankle is weak, I suggest you put one, it's really cool
and I have to, this is the one, one down
Hello, how are you? Good, good man
Man, I've been watching you skate for a while
Yeah, we're doing filming on a YouTube
That's awesome
Yeah, he's asked me, thank you, thank you, I'm glad you showed back up
See people like that, you just want to skate, they're just so happy to see me
and I'm happy to see them and everybody, always and all the time
I'll be there for all of you
As long as I can skate
The only guy I will tell goes, I have to kind of warm up in a kind of just roll and roll
What the hell?
Search, I come it's not doing anything now
Do you think about your brother when you skate?
Yeah, there's some times that most of the time really, like music that he used to play for me
It really hit me
And when it hit really bad, I could just, I could just stand there and still and concentrate
And then until the music is over, I'll skate to a different song level
Add some positive, lots of positive
When I see people, they have a positive insight on that sort of, yeah, you know, because all you think about is skating
and not anything else
You forget, you have problems, you're in a different world that you're just gliding with the music
And you skate and you just keep going and you don't want to stop because it feels so good
The key to happiness is to make people smile
It doesn't cost anything to smile
And it makes you smile also, you know
And skating, it's like, it's just like you're skating and smiling and that's nice
People are beautiful, they're meant to be happy, everybody should be happy
Thank you
