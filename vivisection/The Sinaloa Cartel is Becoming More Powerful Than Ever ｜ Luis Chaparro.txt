One of the main reasons I wanted to get you in here is not only because your work is incredible
but the the cartels in Mexico and Central and South America are you know better than
anybody one of the most misunderstood topics and being a journalist in Mexico covering
the cartels has got to be one of the most dangerous jobs on earth definitely man they it really
is it really is what the hell is going on in Mexico well man in Mexico it's always something
going on and and it's been crazy for some years now but I think it's just in recent years maybe
the last I guess the last decade things are really going off rails you know cartels are
overpassing the power of even politicians or you know like the government and they've been
receiving so much support by the US you know like a lot of us trained police officers or
Mexican military are going to work with the cartel so you can you can sort of like guess what's
what's that like you know like those guys are properly equipped properly trained hard to fight
on and they in Mexico as you know there's a lot of well and I think a lot in America corruption
is ramping you know it's it's crazy the levels of corruption what made you want to like get into
this world and cover all the stuff and document these things going on and embed yourself with
these cartels like what made you want to do I mean it's a fucking dangerous thing to do like
what was it that got you into it it is man I mean I think I think what got me in was the
fact that I grew up in Ciudad Juarez I was born and raised in Ciudad Juarez in this border city
just across old Paso, Texas and back then I grew up in the 90s and in the 90s everybody was
talking about narcos you know like about Amado Carrillo, El Señor de los Cielos,
The Lord of the Sky and all of those guys but they weren't talking us we're talking right now
you know like they're like dangerous people and they can be ruthless and violent they were
talking like if you're talking about Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk you know like everybody was like
wow Amado Carrillo is cool man he has like three wives and the same school the same school his
kids to where I went to school with two of his kids so it was some glamour I guess around his
around like all narcos but to me was really confusing because I grew up in that and then
when I came like to I don't know maybe secondary school middle school I was so confused because
then everybody started talking about how they were being violent and my parents they're sort of
like wealthy in the city so they've always lived in in a in a world neighborhood and all of a
sudden like then they started like expelling narcos from the neighborhoods you know like because
before you will have a neighborhood and Amado Carrillo and all those guys were leaving on the
house next to yours but out of all of a sudden they were like okay we don't want these guys because
they're violent and they're bad and they're doing bad shit so they started basically outcasting them
so that shift made me I don't know confused made me like what is going on in my city what's going
on in my country I grew up with with those guys I know some of his kids and everything and now
they're like sort of like outcasts and then when I started going up also like in 2010 I was because
18 or something like that the whole violence broke loose in my city as you know was once called
the murder capital of the world because we had so many killings the rate was like 13 killings a
day so how many a day the 13 holy shit it was it was fucking crazy man and I remember that I was
that every time I went out I had a motorcycle so every time I went out and then we'll go back
king to the gay community where my parents live I was like fuck man I made it another day you know
I got five of my friends killed in the same event in the same place so five of your friends were
killed at one place at one time yeah at a bar at a bar right yeah how did that happen I I'm not
sure if they confused them for for someone else or it was because another guy told me that they got
into a fight in a different bar over a girl and apparently she was with one of these bad guys so he
had them followed and he just shut off the bar and killed everybody so but that was that was
fucking crazy because I mean I was supposed to be at that bar that night you know we're supposed to
go all together but I overslept in my in my in my house so I woke up at three in the morning
and getting all these calls from my editors about five young kids being killed in a bar
because I was already writing for for news so I showed up there and it's all my all my friends
so yeah that was that was fucking crazy man that changed my life a lot and since then I started
like wondering what happened to them and then I realized that it doesn't really matter what happened
to them because it keeps happening to everyone but the the the thing that matters is it's like
why who's moving this this issue you know who's really behind the whole thing and how this shit
works yeah so I think that's the that's how I got to to jump into into this is the CIA working
with the cartels yeah yeah yeah I mean short short answer is yes they are yeah man not only
the CIA also I guess every other agency in the US or every every three-lettered agency in the US
is the FBI you know like most of those guys are collaborating with with narcos not only in Mexico
but all through Latin America man and I mean they're not it's not like they're you know like smuggling
drugs themselves but it's like they're breaking deals you know narco the drug traffickers in Mexico
the issue has gotten so big right now that it is easily it's very easy to to unstabilize a country
through through narco you know through violence through truck trafficking and all of that shit
and and I know for a fact that some of these narcos they don't even know they're being played by
US agencies to unstabilize you know the Mexican government or Mexican forces you know
so what is what specifically is the US's involvement with these cartels like you told me to watch that
that documentary on amazon prime the last I think it's called the last narc yes narc who was the
guy named that it was the Mexican DEA agent who was basically murdered by so a couple drug lords
and there was a famous or a very well-known CIA clandestine CIA agent there yeah Felix Rodriguez
exactly and they murdered this guy this guy who worked for the DEA yeah what is their specific
involvement and what is in it what is the incentive to work together I think the involvement has a
lot of layers so one of the one of the main layers it's I don't know supplying aircrafts or
legal entrants under their radar to drug into the US I guess that's something that the US has
overt before but there are a lot of there is a lot of collaboration out in the open talking about
el mayo you know el mayo sambada it's basically like the biggest narco now in Mexico he has always
been el mayo he's uh he started before el chapo guzman and the chapo guzman was actually working
under under el mayo sambada the thing is like he's too shadowy no one no one really knows where he
is there's only one photo of him on the internet really so no one has really in that photo it's
like from the 80s or 90s some shit like that he must be old so he's old now he's old now and he's
always been around he has his people um I was personally uh at a party a party uh recently
in Culiacan with uh with his security people he's he's basically his cicarios his hitman group
and he's he's still in the mountains controlling the whole fucking business from Sinaloa
no one really knows where he is how he looks right now he's been too too shadowy but the thing is
most two or three of his sons were arrested in the U.S. in different uh occasions right like so
2013 one of his son was arrested in Nogales and then another one in I think San Diego something
like that and that family keeps dosing both governments keeps uh they're keeping out of
trouble like El Chapo right El Chapo got life sentence and these three kids of him knowingly
by the U.S. that they were trafficking and working under the biggest organization in Latin America
which is the Sinaloa Gardel they're breaking deals with with everybody so they're in the U.S.
one of them it's actually free to go back and forth Mexico as a as a legal permanent resident
of the U.S. the other guy just got his sentence reduced so I think he's going to go out next month
from Yale and the other guy received um he got I think they they changed his old identity and he
got like legal status to stay in the the U.S. with his family and everything and no one really
know where he is and and El Mayo is still free so when you when you see that there has to be some
involvement right I mean it's not it's not like they they hire super fucking great lawyers that they
can you know do whatever they want it's because they're breaking deals with the U.S. yeah the one
I have a really good friend who's actually a lawyer who has represented some big drug lords in
I don't think Mexico but definitely Colombia and the way he describes the whole war on drugs to me
is this he says these guys who are hiring him to represent him they'll they'll fly him first
class to Colombia and they'll meet in like he'll be instructed to go to a lobby of a hotel
and they call him up whenever they're ready and these guys do not get in trouble these guys stay
out of out of jail they stay out of trouble completely the guys who get in trouble are like
the low-level pawns yeah like the guys who are captaining the boats or picking up cargo or making
shipments or or moving shit around like it's the poor people yeah who are like the foot soldiers
are the ones that are getting in trouble and getting busted exactly definitely man and that's
and that's like let's let's call it like the simplest collaboration right now talking about
all the I don't know if you if you know this operation called iniciativa medida
medida initiative where it's basically the U.S. funding millions and millions of dollars
to you to Mexican security forces so they can fight against the the naticos right they're
basically funding weapons vehicles airplanes training so and all that stuff it's ending up
working for the naticos right because Mexico is so corrupt as well and the U.S. has done nothing
but just wash their hands and say like okay we're just gonna train you and give you a lot of money
and good luck with the fighting the fucking cartels a whole fucking town was killed by an elite group
that was actually trained with the U.S. Marines and so they were initially there were Mexican
military elite group they got like the best training with the best of the best in the U.S. like from
Navy SEALs and all that shit oh so these guys were these guys actually were like born in Mexico
moved to the U.S. and were recruited by the army or the Marines and they got they were officially
trained by both countries right like so Mexico said like okay I need these people trained because
they're like Mexican top elite military okay so they trained them and after training and given them
equipment and everything they started fleeing the the Mexican military and jumping and going to work
with a cartel with losetas but they still got a lot of links and contacts inside the Mexican
government so there was a time when the set that had had a snitch inside them so the snitch was
given information to the U.S. authorities to the DEA specifically about the movement of these guys
where these guys were shipping drugs from cargo so they started like busting a lot of
cargoes from losetas right the thing is the DEA called the Mexican army and they're like hey we
got a snitch on on your side and I think you should talk to him he's a pretty good contact
he's inside losetas and not that shit and of course that that group in the in the army
leaked the information to losetas right because they were getting money so they're like hey guys
what child you gotta you gotta snitch on your side and I'm getting this information from the DEA
directly that's where you're getting a lot of drug busts and what they did because they they
didn't know who the rat was so what they did is they killed a whole fucking town in one night one
day a whole we're talking about like a whole family's a whole fucking town how many people
was by the hundreds jesus so they killed a whole fucking town how long ago was this uh I think it
was in 2011 or something like 2011 something like that there's a there's a there's a Netflix show a
series called Somos Somos yeah I heard of that exactly and it's about that massacre man and that
was that was fucking crazy and that's another proof of the involvement of the U.S. right
sharing information with people that is not properly bedded right not taking care of their
informants all that shit and they're breaking deals with everyone um right now just coming here
I was a bit late a few minutes late because I got a call from a guy who works with uh with a
criminal organization in the in the Sonora state at the border with Arizona and he was uh I've been
in touch with him recently talking about fentanyl all that shit yeah and he was like hey man you
don't want a one I really want out and I really need out from from from from the cartel because
things are getting crazier and crazier for me and my family yeah so I don't know if you know someone
in the U.S. government that wants information and that I can share info with but if they can
relocate me to the U.S. I will share the whole fucking shit like who's dealing fentanyl all
this stuff and I'm like to it I don't know if I can do that I mean that's pretty fucking tricky
you know that's something I've never done and I don't know if it's actually if it actually
works like that but good luck you know I wish so he wants out of the cartel and he wants protection
from the U.S. from the DA or the CIA or something like that and we're talking about that happening
a lot you know and the U.S. playing playing along those lines as well yeah yeah that's a
crazy thing because I mean I feel like even if you did do that you would still they still the
cartel can still find ways in the U.S. to kill somebody right yeah for sure oh yeah what what
is it like how do you embed yourself with these groups of people and how do you get them to trust
you when you're are you like filming shit or do you just like what do you document how do you
document it when you meet up with these people and you stay with them I I have I have a lot of
years working on the same beat and doing the same and learning the bad way I've had two
guns to my head before that I thought that I was gonna die right there and I learned you got
kidnapped right I got kidnapped yeah so in Ciudad Juarez by the local police by the way
was not even you know clearly worked for the cartels exactly yeah yeah so they I got kidnapped
by by the local police ones and I got locked up in a in a warehouse by another fucking guy who
was a cartel member so I learned the bad way but what I learned is to be completely honest and
clear about my intentions with these people right not faking that I'm friends not faking that I'm
on their side not faking faking that anything and also letting them know that some of my sources
also are on the other side of the of the of the spectrum right that I have sources in the DEA in the
FBI and inside CIA and that I'm not and that I'm talking to them in the same way that I'm talking
to to to these other bad guys you know that I'm making them super clear that I don't believe in
good guys and bad guys that I understand that everything is a grayscale and and there is
good guys that do bad shit and bad guys that does good shit and all that stuff so I guess
that's how they that's how they feel comfortable sharing a lot of their stuff with me and because
I've never betrayed um betrayed anyone right I've never had to call you know authorities or
someone and say like hey here is a huge fucking bus a few huge fucking load of whatever drug or
something like that or the other way around right a US agent tell telling them to those guys like
you know this agent is investigating you is after you or whatever I keep all that shit to myself
because it's not worth it it's a it's a it's a fucking game that no one's gonna fucking win and I
don't want to be in the middle right I'm just there to to tell stories to bring light into what's
happening trying to educate readers in Mexico and the US about what really is going on and and why
is and who's playing behind these fucking forces right um and I think that's uh that and and time
gave me the access that I have inside some of the organizations many people are pretty pretty scared
to to go and to embed with uh with narcos and and I'm not saying I'm not but um but I don't know I
guess like to me is like there's an opportunity these guys say like hey man I've been reading and
watching your reports um and somehow I feel like I trust you that I can trust you for the way you
protect your sources for the way you don't share like specifics on any information do you want access
to these or do you want access to that and I'm like fuck yes and I take every single opportunity
I can get you know of course if it's if it's worth it and if I feel um safe enough if you can call
it that what's in it for them for you to report and like write this shit about them make documentaries
about them like what do you what do they think about that you have to know that the um the way
social media is playing now is making everybody wanting to show what they do for our living you
know you have car sellers you have I don't know water sellers you have drug sellers drug traffickers
killers and many are attracted by the fact that they and their work can be out there without
actually no one really knowing who is who and that's uh that's an uh that's something that
attracts them that I find that that they want to share you know if you will look at my um
whatsapp or a signal or telecom right now it's fucking loaded with a lot of shit you know a lot
of cargoes a lot of guns a lot of you know stuff that they keep sending me because they're like hey
they watch they want like the it's like anonymous clout exactly it's it's it's weird I know it's
it sounds weird but they they're just like that you know like they they want to they want to
show what they do they want to feel important uh remember that by the time you are inside the
narco and you have a narco corrido in your name that's huge you have a song someone's
singing about you yeah that's fucking huge for them that's that's when they feel they made it you
know that's like okay I have my own do you think these guys like aspire to be like El Chapo or Pablo
Escobar I think so I think pretty much those guys I mean those guys pretty much think that they're
going to be the next the next one up right um and especially because they most of them they
start early they start very young so they start looking up to El Chapo or to El Mayo right now
they call him El Señor del Sombrero the the man of the hat and that's a that's a that's a keyword
to talk about the real boss of the Sinaloa Cartel right if you see someone with a with a
vaquero hat you know a cowboy hat on the cap or who has a hat on the hanging from their mirror
you will know that those guys praise or work for El Señor del Sombrero right so they want
to be El Señor del Sombrero they want to be that and they're super young I mean of course they
last enough to turn 30 40 years inside the cartel that's when they start getting disappointed
and saying like shit man it's not like that it doesn't yeah bro the life expectancy of somebody
starts working for the cartel at a young age must not be that high because you got it like even
El Chapo like I didn't was that that's something I didn't realize about El Chapo that I learned
from that documentary was that he was fucking slaying and butchering people at a super young age
super young age yeah yeah I don't know if you if you um saw the um a story I posted on my Instagram
recently I think it was like two days ago about one of the youngest icarios for the cartel Jalisco
Nova Generación which is a ruthless cartel um and he was like what maybe nine years old
I mean the the the weapon he had on himself was bigger than than him he had like a huge I don't
know if it was like an AK or a kind of fucking weapon but it was huge and you can you can watch
his face and he's a he's a kid I of course I I posted that and I covered his eyes to
sort of like protect his identity um but he's a a worker for the cartel it's a worker for the
cartel man and he's like super super young let me see if I still have the photo of him because
he really looks like I mean if he's on your Instagram it's on my Instagram I think
right we got it right here so if you can pull it up I think it was on one of my stories I don't
know if it's uh I don't know if he expired okay but um but yeah man I mean he he he looked like
if it was if he was 12 years look there he is
Jesus Christ man how does it look like just barely a toddler yeah exactly man
and I know that this you took that photo and no one one of one of the uh one of the guys working
on their cartel Jalisco sent it to me sent it over and so like look at look at the soldiers of the
cartel Jalisco and then I posted that and then I covered his his face and everything and then
another guy from another cartel fighting the cartel Jalisco sent me a DM and and said like
something like poor kid he's dead now he's dead already and I asked him like is he dead
he's like no but we're after him I mean he's gonna die young I'm like shit man but he's a kid you
know can you fucking leave him alone just scare him and have him out you know and and he's like no
it's not like that dude that's so fucked up man so scary yeah man yeah it's a different
fucking world there how does a kid end up in the fucking cartel at nine years old
is it just like is his parents in the cartel or like is it just that way is just like you're
born and you if you're if you're poor and you grow up on the streets you it's hard to
not get into the heart cartel you know it's um I know I I know like the sort of like the story of
that guy that kid he doesn't have a dad he has a mom that she knows what he's doing but see
she tricks him like like a kid I mean he had a birthday cake on on his I think it was like
10th birthday or some shit like that like a kid so they're just normalizing Mexico it's normalizing
violence like everything it's getting to a level where a new incident that happens like
younger kids the first we are like super scared and alarmed about that right we were like fuck
man they're super young but then you have another news where a nine-year-old kid was shot dead and
this and that and then you start normalizing the whole fucking violence and that's happening in
Mexico a lot and and that's what is worrying me you know like it's like dude this is not normal
this is everything but fucking normal what's happening in Mexico and to answer your question on
how these kids um end up working with with the cartel a lot of a lot of rural Mexico is uh
it's super poor there's there's no help from anyone basically you will have to do a lot of
shit to get food to your table you know like it's it's really like that or education roads no work
at all so that's a gap by the government and every gap that the government has then not a goal
steps in and covers for that gap right you need schools i'm going to bring it in right you need
food i'm going to bring it in you need to work i have work for you so that's why i say everything
is a grayscale because it's like all right what what are they supposed to do right to to die of
hunger to leave their parents to die at the town and go to the city to work which was what well
chapeau did um what are they supposed to do if the government is not taking care of them or anyone
you know like citizens like like myself or no one is really taking care of them and their needs
there's only one group that is actually taking care of them and it's the nautical and what do
they get in return the loyalty of a whole fucking town right so when militaries come in they start
blocking fighting or snitching on them and say like hey the military is coming be careful right
right it's like what am i going to do am i going to bust my ass and struggle and try to you know
whatever work in a fucking in a cornfield or or do some other fucking manual labor for pennies yeah
or do this get a fucking gun and kill some people and make tens of thousands of dollars
exactly and it's not like for for my experience it's not like the the cartel is enticing them or
you know like forcing them to work just everybody knows about it right they're just around all the
time but they are the only ones with the huge pickup trucks you know with the blings and oh really
and everything so they're like dude i want to be like them they have like cool fucking pickup
trucks and my neighbor is 15 years old and he has already an atb and and a pickup you know
so they're like hey dude where do you get that pickup from and it's like from i don't know they
usually have a name right from from el delin or from el cholo or from whatever and it's like
dude can you tell him if uh if i can go into and it's like for sure and those guys are like yeah
why not how did and why do you think el chopo got busted and how did how did he end up in prison
in the u.s because you think that he would be somebody who would remain fucking untouched like
el mayo and chopo was never the boss of the sinaloa cartel he was he was he was never the no he was
never the boss of the sinaloa cartel not at all uh you know most of the people don't don't know
or don't grasp the idea that the sinaloa cartel was not born in sinaloa it was born in la that's
where the sinaloa cartel actually grew and was born in los angeles in los angeles that's the
that's the the basically the cradle of of the el sinaloa cartel el mayo sambada was one of the
founders along with a cuban man that i forget his name right now that was uh that was like the
father in law or something like that for el mayo and they both were immigrants living in la and
they started because the first thing you need to be a successful trafficker is a buyer right you
can have all the products you you want but if you don't have a buyer you have nowhere to go no money
to make so these two guys made our whole network of buyers in in la and they started moving the money
they started they knew the place they knew sinaloa they had family there so they started like making
the strings the first time the sinaloa cartel became a cartel it was established in la from from
buyers in la and what was what were they selling cocaine weed weed yeah exactly it was it was
weed at the at the very beginning but also like the first established connection to bring huge loads
for the sinaloa cartel of cocaine were as well buyers in la wait was that in the 80s that was in
the 80s yeah okay so that was like roger reeves area era yeah exactly so that's that's that's the
like the first thing right and the thing el chapo grew up in in in badira guato a very small town in
sinaloa someone gave him a job right someone hired him first to wash the the cars you know like to
clean the cars and the shit and they got like more involvement but what he had was a huge
fucking ego and a huge fucking necessity to be recognized other than a little indio from the
mountains right he wanted to be someone else and i guess that served his purpose for the cartel
he's like oh so you want to be important right you want to be someone so why aren't you why aren't
you the face of the cartel you know go out there have the money have everything you want you're
the fucking face while we run the cartel from behind talking about el mayo and talking about
white-collar people right like lawyers politicians business owners and all that stuff there were
like as soon as he's willing to put his fucking face out there like we're a good man how about it
and he did he wanted to make a fucking film he wanted to make documentaries the the um so what
was he doing what was his his role at the peak of his involvement i guess he was like a manager
for the whole thing it's like if you had i don't know a store on this place and i'm the real owner
i'm the one with the money with the hooks with everything with everything but i'm like okay i'm
getting the money the big bugs do you want to take care of this and be the face to the tour
clients like the ronald mcdonald yes exactly the job was like the ronald mcdonald for this
cartel and once his purpose stopped serving the real owners they deliver himself they deliver
him they were like fuck it it's not we'll give you chopper exactly because he was too flashy by
then right every fucking body knew his face his whereabouts everybody knew his whole family i
have most of his family on my instagram account and they still have a lot of fucking money man
on your instagram account they have instagram accounts and i mean they're following you
they're following when i'm following them and most of them are living in the us they don't even
many don't even speak spanish man really he's um he has a two or three year old
granddaughter living in LA and her gift for this birthday was uh i think he was a raptor a raptor
ford or the ford rap but like the fuck in the 2022 for raptor or something like that so he was
just a manager and he had that kind of money he has that kind of money exactly and how does he
have that money still how is he doing it from prison i think i mean you don't need to be there
for every deal right you just need to have the contacts and the sources and keep everybody
at play and playing their role you know go kill that guy go do these go do that and he's doing that
he used to do that right now he's not able to even talk to anyone he only has three calls a month
and two bedded people right so it's basically his granddaughter one of his daughters also
and his mom and he can only speak 15 he has only 15 minutes a month to speak to
whichever those three person he can talk to and his lawyers his his attorneys i had an exclusive
interview with his main attorney posted on my instagram as well last week where she she tells
a lot of details about how el chapo is really you know she says he's funny he has good sense of humor
he's very respectful uh and that he knows that if the us wants to stop the cartels you'll have to
go against politicians and so that's an interesting against what politicians against the us politicians
and mexico both us and mexican politicians they're like that's that's that's how you stop the cartel
and i'm like wow that's a fucking interesting have you ever met el chapo never met but i i
saw him on his last last arrest before being extradited he was arrested in mexico city
and he was presented to to the press from the mexico hangar you know from the from the military
base where he was being held before being transported to ciudad juarez actually i try to
go into the prison in ciudad juarez to try and see if i could cool speak to someone but now he was
like completely on the shoot you know like he was not able to he was not able even i mean the guys
who deliver food for him where um they couldn't even look him in the eye they had to be looking
somewhere else and then give him the food it's so crazy how at least from my perspective it seems
like the media's portrayed him as like the king pin bought like the the number one hefe of the
sinaloa cartel it's also a purpose man it's when you when you work in the news and i'm telling you
because i work in the fucking news it's super difficult to tell a story right because you
will need to write so many words and enter in so many details that your articles will have to be
extra fucking long and complicated articles explaining how everything works right so the
easiest way is let's just say ol chapo right i mean he's sort of like the manager and the head
and everybody says he's the head so just put ol chapo because people knows his name people
knows who we're talking about it serves a purpose especially for especially like getting clicks and
views and click bait type shit yeah totally talking about ol chapo people are gonna click on it exactly
yeah yeah and i mean i've written stories obviously trying to set things straight and say like okay he
was just a fucking manager because how comes if he was responsible for all this shit he's in jail
he's not even to speak to anyone right now how comes his family keeps getting a lot of fucking money
how comes the organic his organization does in a locker tell has never shipped so many cocaine
than when he was in jail right they're shipping more since he's been in prison exactly more
yeah so it's like the i mean it's obviously obviously not working right that kingpin strategy
it's not fucking working it's just a waste of the taxpayers money how much money are this
are this they're spending on keeping ol chapo locked on paying agents to go into Mexico to try to
capture a kingpin to put him behind jail behind bars to transport him extradite him and all that shit
and at the end it doesn't really makes nothing on the on the real business right on the on the
coke trade on the drug trade why don't we obviously if america wanted to they could completely take
out the cartels but how would they do that i think first of all we'll have to you have to go after
the money enough not after the guys right you stop the flow on money however it is you know like by
frozen uh freezing their their accounts seizing bank accounts because we're talking about these
guys are laundering money in us companies they're laundering money through us banks through us
established companies so you have to go after all of all of that that fucking shit i mean
the remittances that go to mexico and mexico is super proud of that saying like wow the or people
in the us who are hardworking people has never sent more money to their families in mexico
the 80 percent of those fucking remittances remittances are going well of the what of the
remittances remittances it's it's the money the immigrant an immigrant um in the u.s working
sense back to his family okay um you know like through monogram and all that stuff all this all
this kind of right and they say it's to support their families in mexico right that's where they're
working here uh but the reality is most of that money is going to smugglers to keep their business
going and keep their family trying to bring their family into the u.s but that money ends up in in
the in in the smugglers pocket and that's a reality and and and people don't grasp it because when
they say like oh so they're not so poor because if they're paying eight fucking grand to get across
the border illegally i mean you can establish uh a business in mexico with a grand easily right a
small restaurant something like that but it's not the money of the people in mexico that's money
from the people working in the u.s and that's basically payment for smugglers that's not
remittances that's that's payment for for bringing illegally people into the u.s so i mean this world
this world works like that it's all on or noses working under you know like established companies
established money being sent into mexico but behind that it's a whole fucking criminal world
operating right in front of us so they're these cartels are also making money by
trafficking people across the border yeah they've never made more money out of that than than what
they're doing right now after the pandemic really and they're charging eight grand a person yes
on the on the on the on the best case scenario um this guy who works uh was selling in sonora border
state we saw that uh was telling me they're rising raising their uh rates to 15 grand per person
they're making shit tons of money man imagine a trailer like what we saw in ton Antonio
full of uh i don't know 60 migrants and each one paying at least 10 grand eight grand that's a
shit ton of money yeah right that's fucking wild man yeah i had no idea that was going on yeah man
i mean for cartels we have to understand that everything that it's illegal they're gonna bank on
that they're gonna they're gonna bank on everything that you make illegal right or everything that has
a good fucking uh profit um talking about avocado for me to icon they're banking a lot of fucking money
from avocados they're banking on on everything they can on everything they can right now yeah it's
interesting one of the things that uh that roger reese was also telling me it was that uh
george or choa he was like yeah he's like i know exactly where he lives i know where his house is
like a flyer there right now he's like he's sitting there probably drinking a glass of whiskey smoking
a cigar he's like he has a horse ranch i was like how the fuck is he doing like how does he
this guy is completely immune to everything after everything he's done all the people that
he's killed like he's completely just living free riding his horses yeah in mexico that's
that's what uh what struck me also about the sons of of emayo right when i learned that one of his
sons was free to go back and forth from the us and mexico i call his lawyer no first his lawyer
called me first because he was he he called me to tell me that his client was sort of like angry at
me about an article i published where i had the name of his client the son of emayo um because i
said that he was still working with the organization of his of his dad uh and the lawyer called you
and the lawyer called me a u.s. based lawyer and he called me and told me that his client
was not happy about my story and that i should leave that part out of my story or change it
and i'm like dude i'm i'm backing up my sources they're pretty strong sources
um inside the senior organization and they know for a fact that your client is still
taking decisions for the organization and he's like my client is a family man he's working
legally on a corn farm in mexico in sonora in caborca and you know caborca it's like one of the
hottest places in mexico for the fire hotel and i'm like is he able to go back and forth then
and he's like no he's established his life in the us but then like two or three weeks later
he got involved into an accident where his wife died in caborca and i'm like i mean he wasn't
really supposed to be in mexico and he's like no comment and i'm like so he's he's able to go
back and forth because he got into an accident in mexico in caborca but why would you a fuck man
i can't imagine if if one of el mayo's kids lawyers called me and said don't publish this
shit i i'm not gonna lie i would be hesitant to publish it i mean it was already published and
second of all i i told him like all right so if you have something to say i can't publish your
version and what you say as a lawyer and it's like no don't quote me and then i'm like okay so then
tell your client that he can openly talk to me and go on record and i can definitely write a whole
story about his version of things and it's like no he's not talking and i'm like so what am i supposed
to do and then he basically hung up the phone and then sent me a text message with a paragraph and
said like this is what's usual right and i'm like well this is not how it works right i'm i need to
quote what you're telling me i need to make it like attributable to someone right i can't just
say that because you're asking me to right so my phone is open you know where to find me and if
you want to go on the record or tell me who am i gonna attribute these quote to um by all means
and he never answered back so explain the story how you got kidnapped i was uh i was
basically starting to write right um i started working on a local newspaper in ciudad juarez by
not my chance because i was already looking but i was too young i was i was in my first year of
college and i went into this local newspaper the main local newspaper in ciudad juarez which is
called el diario de juarez and i went basically to apply for a job to to be a delivery boy right
so i'm like eh i couldn't work during the night delivering the paper being the first one to read
it and actually just you know like sneaking to the newsroom to start finding how this shit works
and figure out if i really want to be a journalist or not okay so i went there and the editor of
the paper got confused and he thought i was there applying for a copy editor position
so he uh he came down from the stairs and told me oh you're here for that copy editor position
right now i'm like yes come on up and he showed me around he put me in front of a computer and
said like okay so that's uh your first your first job right and i had no clue what the
fuck to do you know so i asked around like what should i do how do i turn on this fucking machine
and everything um of course after i don't know maybe three months they they they learned that
that i faked my position but i was already in and i was already working and doing some good
jobs so we're like ah fuck it man we're gonna we're gonna give you the job and on the longer term
so i started very young without without actually college education right so i started like working
learning while i was working and going to college that's incredible and it was pretty cool to me
how old are you now i'm 35 okay and so that was pretty cool to me but at the same time
it i have i i didn't have the proper tools right um and not to say they um we have never
seen anything like that fucking warren drugs in mexico before that was the first time and
in in the whole country that we started seeing people honking from the bridges um that um
that amount of murders in the city talking about a fight between cartels that ruthless talking about
you know like basukas in the middle of a fucking gunfight you know like grenades so it was full
on war we didn't know what to do not even like experienced journalists had experienced that before
so i was in the in the battleground learning at school at a newspaper and at the same time
in the streets of the fucking epicenter of a drug war um so in the middle of all of that
i started like publishing some investigations like how cartels were recruiting people over metro
vlog back then before myspace and before facebook what was it called it was called metro vlog okay
and it was huge in mexico it was like a social network and they started recruiting people young
young cigarios um over metro vlog right and i published that and that gave again a lot of
attention for that story uh from from everywhere from other journalists but also from sources uh
in the in the cartel but also in in law enforcement so i had this guy who told me that he was an
informant for the dea and that he had a lot of information about what's going on in mexico and
we kept um writing back and forth for at least at least a year before i actually met him in
in Ciudad Juarez and he he gave me these papers with a lot of phone numbers and and audio files
from a woman working for the local police in Ciudad Juarez she was a police officer uh but she
was uh literally fucking um a military commander um federal police commander as well and a local
police chief so she was in bed with the three of them and an arco so she was sharing information
all over you know like she was getting paid by all over those guys but to share information
about each other you know so she was like in the middle of of everything uh he gave me her name
her phone number a lot of recordings he had on on her and how she was operating and of course
a pooch if i can story right this is a local police woman in bed with all these people sharing
information on one of the calls that i got i got to listen how she's dealing information between
each other she said these and that so i had the whole fucking story it went to um to the um to the
cover of the of the newspaper on both sides in El Paso in Ciudad Juarez so it was a huge story i was
super happy because i was like wow my finally my stories are making the the form page right um
and that was that my editor told me are you sure you want to you want to have your byline
your name on the byline we can we can have a different name or uh or a you know like a nickname
or something and i'm like of course i need my name man it's a huge fucking investigation
and and that was my mistake after i don't know two or three nights i left my girlfriend at the time
at her house was driving back to my to my parents house and two police officers on
different uh pickup trucks they stopped being in the middle of the night they started um
hitting my my window with their guns like get the fuck out of the car and i was pretty sure
that they were taking me by mistake right i was like they're looking for someone else it's a
fucking mess in the city and i'm the only dude that it's out one in the morning in the streets
but i had my my newspaper batch and everything so i went down from my car they started like kicking
me and pushing me around i was like hey dude i i think you're mistaken it's like no we're not
mistaking man you know what you did they kept kicking me and and beating me and i never i never
understood like until that point i was like why are the these guys are just fucking confusing
i mean i have what did i do and they're like you know what you did after a while of that
they took my uh my car keys some one of those guys jumped into my car and started driving and they
tied my my hands and my ankles and put me in the back of a pickup truck and they put their foot
on top of my on the back of your pickup truck no a different one on their pickup on the on the
official police pickup truck right uh and they put their feet on my back so so i will stay down
while they were driving um they started driving for about i don't know like 20 25 minutes and then i
felt they went like uh into a dirt road and i was like fuck man i'm i'm fucked and they stopped
they untied me and one of those guys uh told me like the commander told me i'm gonna give you a
chance to run uh so start fucking running and i immediately knew that he was gonna fucking shoot
me in the back if i started running and say like he got me there by mistake or that i had a gun on
me or some shit like that so i was like i'm not i'm not gonna run man it's like are you stupid
or what i'm gonna i'm giving you a fucking chance to run and you're not taking it and i'm like no
man i know what these guys are straight up going playing on executing yeah yeah totally because
he told me he told me like they're gonna find you um he used this word uh he told me there
they will find you in the back of your car as a cattle as dead cow all right come come
on back come out that's that's what told me um uh so they they were up to me like they were really
trying to kill me and i remember that i got in my knees and i don't remember being uh yelling or
screaming but the commander told me stop fucking yelling and i'm like i'm not yelling i'm just asking
you for a favor and it's like you're not in no position of asking a favor and you started like
beating me again with this fucking gun and i'm like i'm not i'm not yelling i'm just asking you for
10 minutes 10 minutes let give me a number and i can have the money uh someone to bring the money
here and just give me 10 minutes how much money will 10 minutes cost me and it's like it's not
like that man you fucked up with the wrong person so you're fucked and then another guy stepped in
and said like what if we and then they just used code numbers right that i sort of like understood
that they were talking about that deal that if what if we get money and let him go for a few
minutes and then we go after him and then we fucking kill him and get the killed and the money
right because i remember i think it was 25 on the on the radio thing they had they used to have
radios right like two-way radio communications to talk between the police uh and i think 25
was referring to a male uh dead to a deceased male and 24 was deceased woman and stuff like that
so i remember that he said something like what if we 19 first and then we 25 him
and i was like shit they're planning something and then they're gonna kill me right so i was like
that's my chance and i'm like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean just let me know keep my fucking car
let me know how much money you need and just give me 10 fucking minutes because i knew
i'm a dual i'm a dual citizen right so i was like i'm gonna fucking run to the u.s to i'll
pass and stay there forever and fuck them right um and then they started like fighting between each
other uh and then the commanders are like all right uh you know what bring me i had two cards at
the time a mexican debit card and a u.s debit card where i was paid by the news organization i
worked with um but the limit uh to to um withdraw from the atm was uh six grand pesos which is like
around 300 bucks on each card so i bring back 600 bucks and i was like that's the limit that i could
get from the atm i was walking so they let you let me leave and i remember by yourself yeah and i
walking though because they kept my wallet and they kept my car um and i remember when i started
walking i was like hey just give me your man's word that you're not gonna shoot me on the back
while i walk out and he's like you you don't you can't ask me for a man's word man but he's like
but you give me yours you're not gonna fucking run because we're gonna find you and your family
we have your id's and everything i'm like dude i'm not trying to run and he's like all right
so i started walking instead of running because in my head i was like if they shoot me it's gonna
look different and my my colleagues at the newspapers they're gonna investigate and they're
gonna know that i was not running i was actually walking and someone shot me on the back because
i was fucking sure that that that was they were gonna fucking shoot me in the back so i started
walking down this dark alley uh went up to an atm down the street down one of the main streets
uh took money from both of my cards and then came back and gave him the money and told told him
like just count the the money like now there's no need uh there you go that's your car make sure
you're not missing anything from your car that's your wallet make sure you're not missing anything
from the wallet and we'll see you in 10 minutes and i'm like all right and i started fucking
driving like crazy but then it was like maybe three in the morning they'll see you in 10 minutes
they were gonna they were gonna find me they're gonna look for me again for from the ids that i had
and from you know everything they gather on me but the thing is i had on i haven't updated my
id from from mexico so i had an old fucking address on my mexican id not the the address
where i was living with my parents right and that address was i mean when i when i was living with
my parents was a gated community super fucking protected where most of the owners of sila thua
to sleep right like the the main uh business owners lawyers doctors other stuff right so it's
very fucking protected it's impossible that they would go in right without getting into trouble
so yeah that's that's how i left i went home i remember one thing i had two phones on me i had
my personal phone and the phone from from the newspaper right and they asked me to turn off
the phones so when i was turning off i turned off the work phone and when i was about to turn off
my personal phone my girlfriend called me to see if everything was good and instead of turning off
the phone i answered so she started listening everything and she called my parents and she
both of them were listening when these guys told me that they were gonna find me dead on the back
of my car that they were gonna kill me uh when they started beating me out that shit so when i got
home my parents were fucking hysterical oh my they were like what the fuck is going on
my dad was fucking crazy and i was like i just need to need to need to go i need to go i need
to go and i packed the fucking backpack you know with clothes i remember i only packed um i only
packed uh jeans and no fucking shirts because i was not thinking straight what did you do straight
to el paso and i went straight to el paso to to a hotel and then i started renting a department
in el paso and i remember it was fucking dark times i was i was crying almost every fucking
night because i was looking at my city and looking at the you know i was like i i want to go back
that's my fucking city man that's where i i want to leave and i lived in an apartment that was
it's like in a small hill and i will look over to see what what is to the whole fucking city
and just thinking about how many people were being killed and what happened to me in that
traumatic event and all the shit and the fact that i couldn't just go there and the fact that
i had to change my my beat of writing from writing from security and investigation to
fucking sports and cultural shit in el paso it was just too much and i remember i used to drink a
lot and cry a lot like every fucking night you know because i was feeling so fucking bad about that
and then like nine months later a source of mine a guy who i went to in in middle school
he uh he started working later eventually he started working with a Korean organization
in Juarez right he started like growing up because his dad used to be a nautical and then he started
like playing the same path and he called me and he told me he asked me like hey what happened to
you and i'm like nothing and he's like what are you and i'm like i might i might work at el diario
and he's like and what happened and i'm like what do you mean because i didn't tell anyone like
anyone i didn't i didn't want anyone to fucking know what happened to me so i was so fucking
scared for my family that i was still living in Juarez i did a report to human rights to leave
it as background for something happened to me i had a file on human rights the international
commission of human rights and that was fucking it and and and he told me no i know that something
happened and i'm like no man it's like well i don't know why why are you not trusting me if i always
have always trust you with my sources and my information and now you're not trusting me i
know something happened to you anyways you have your reason not to tell me but if you want to
turn on the tv tonight i'm gonna leave you a present to make you feel better and i'm like
whatever turn on the news that it was i think it was like at 9 p.m and in the same spot where these
first two pickup trucks stopped me before taking me that in that same place those both pickup
trucks were shot that they killed the fucking police officers and i'm pretty sure it was the
same police officers that stopped me that night so i think it was him i think it was my contact
who actually got them killed got the police killed and shit and i call him back and so he knew about
all this he knew how you so that means he must have known about you getting kidnapped and you
the plan for you to get executed yeah yeah yeah and i asked him crying angry and told him that to
never call me again i was like dude i don't want to carry those fucking buddies with me you know
like that's not my fault i'm a fucking journalist i'm not a fucking murderer i never asked you for
anything you fucked up that's on you that's on your hands not on mine and he was like aren't you
happy you can actually go back to what is not feel safe and i'm like dude it's not how it works
man i'm not in that world stop calling me i'm telling you from today on we're not friends
we're i don't know you man bye and i stopped communicating with him up until today i never
have a word again with him this is a guy that you know since since since kids he used to be my
neighbor and then we went to school together and all that shit uh so it was a very mixed feeling
right because at the same time i was like that's that's not who i am but at the same time i was
like well does that mean that i can go back to my city and feel safe again right and i started going
day by day and feeling more comfortable and more comfortable and then i moved back into what is
so i fucking love living in what is really what is it about who are is that that's so much better
what do you love about it i don't know man i don't know i mean of course i have family now so that's
why we have a house in el paso but we rent a apartment in what is um but and of course my
family stays uh the longest time in el paso we don't really spend much time in what is but
every time i can i i i i stay there i stay there i just fucking love the path to the city it's a
it's it's a it's a dangerous animal you know like so and i like that about what is i mean is it
like the dry is it like an adrenaline rush being there i guess it's the mix of i guess it's the
mix of i compared to like imagine you you're the owner of a super fucking dangerous lion
it's a lion and he can kill you anytime but you've known him for fucking ever and you know he's not
gonna kill you so you go in the jail and you enjoy you know like playing with the fucking
killing animal that you know he's not gonna kill you but he might
you know and it's and you know him so fucking well have you ever heard of that theory people
have i've heard it talked a many times before where people talk about that they're supposedly
a set time and place where everybody's gonna die yeah have you heard have you heard that talked
about before and there's like a peep they they try to attribute it to people who are just like
do crazy daredevil stunts like that that guy alex holland who who climbs the mountains with no
no gear or anything he just has a bag of chalk in his hands and he climbs these giant like
hundred foot cliffs and like they try to figure out why these people just do these incredibly
death defying feats with all the time and they're still alive and they seem to have no fear of
it like how do you know how are you not afraid of dying no i am the thing is that's that's what i get
a lot of wrong from people they i always assumed that i'm not afraid you know like that i i'm not
afraid when i go into these places where all that shit but i am i am i am afraid and i've been
afraid most of my fucking life and and i am afraid every time i have to go in bed and i have i'm
afraid everything every time i get a call all this shit but you were born in it so you understand
it better than 99.9 of people i guess i guess i'm more curious than afraid you know i'm i'm
cute i mean when the lawyer of my son called me i knew that something because i was i was like
this is an arizona um area code phone number not not good news are coming from this shed
and i knew it so i had i had a choice i had like i can either don't answer the call
or answer the call if i answer the call i'm gonna engage in that conversation that i might not
want to hear you know that i might be better well off um but at the same time is like fuck it i mean
i'm so curious to know who it is and why um the call it just got before getting here
that guy talking about and i know his number and i have him register on their codes as most of
those sources and i know who he was and my phone started ringing and i'm like oh i'm about to leave
i'm about to request my overdrive to to hear but i'm like fuck it let's see what he wants and
because i'm more curious about that you know don't you do you feel like that you are these guys like
you are the same you like you and these guys that are in these that are working in the cartels
whether no matter what level they might be at do you feel like that you guys are like the same
it's just that you kind of you took one different turn at one point but you guys are still like
everything about you is the same like you could easily have been him he could have easily been
you yeah more than that i feel like i'm the same as every other fucking human in in the world and
that's i think that's it's true that's my advantage right like we are all a grayscale
there's no bad guy right it's fully bad there's no good guy that is fully good when you see someone
that is portrayed as complete a hundred percent a bad person there's something wrong about that
this is like there's something off there's something that it's not right and it's not completely
through the same as the same as if you feel that one guy is so fucking good and he's a hundred percent
a good person there's there has to be something super fucking off on that dude you know yeah
because we're that doesn't exist man and i'm and i know that for a fucking fact there is no black or
white right we are all a fucking grayscale some of us are a little more on on the on the darker
side of that grayscale some of us more on the wider wider you know like scale but we are and
that's how i feel about everyone every single fucking human and i guess that's i guess they see
the humanity in these people that no one else does and i think they perceive that i treat them
as i will treat everybody fucking else a president um u.s. soldier my friend you know like
they're not my friends so i don't talk to them like hey i'm ego you know i'll talk to them like
with respect respecting their fucking human and that i'm not especially afraid of them for any
particular reason that's what they do for fucking leaving their adults that's their that's what they
chose and i have nothing to do with that right i'm not pushing them or asking them out of that
i'm just taking them for what they are it's like okay that was your fucking choice i'm not judging
and by showing fear you're judging someone right you're judging that you're dangerous you're violent
you are a bad guy and i'm the good guy because i'm the one afraid of you and by not having or
showing the fear you have it's like equals it's like yeah i mean i can be bad too man and you
can be good too and whatever i don't i don't care about that let's let's talk business let's talk
what do you want to talk about so does that not frustrate the shit out of you when you see like
the main news organizations especially on tv talk about everything because they they talk about
everything in black and white that's that's the the narrative you got to paint it one this news
organization paints it black this news organization paints it white yeah and they all try to dislike
like generalize everything yeah i mean it's it's frustrating because i'm part of that shit you know
like i'm right that's why i'm saying let's be so frustrating i i work for news outlets and every
time i pitch something it's not interesting and every time i know that i'm gonna pitch something
that it's interesting it's because it's over simplistic right i mean i got used to it i'm used
to it and that's why i'm being more active and on my social accounts and like my instagram account
to to talk about how i really feel about issues how how i really how am i really finding these
particular issues or people or stuff right because i mean one thing it's to put up a news where you
say oh chapeau why is the biggest trafficker in the world whatever but when i go in my instagram
or my twitter go and say like well he's not really the boss and try i try to explain what's behind
that news right and i tried to have a i don't know like live streams every month at least where i
talk about that and and i talk about like the latest news and try to go more in depth about
about all that stuff um that's why i guess i i come to to shows like like yours like the one
i was the other channel um trying to to set the records right because the news are not the place
to do that i mean they they are supposed to but they're not so does that there's a process work
where you're you're pitching stories to just like your contacts in the media like you have
different relationships with different like publications like vice or business insider
and you kind of come up with stories or do they ever reach out to you and ask you to do do reporting
both i guess at the beginning it was more of me pitching a lot okay i used to i used to um had a
like a record of pitching and i was like okay how many stories did i pitched on this week
and i was pitching about 200 stories a month so i was like pitching wow and and and getting 10%
of those approved how the fuck do you find 200 stories to pitch there's a lot of fucking stories
all over latin america happening at the same time and so it's just a matter of being aware and how you
look that same news that everybody's reporting on and finding a new angle you know and as a freelancer
you have to be way better than their staffers not better in the sense of better journalists but
with a with a different perspective than their staffers something their staffers are not tapping
right because otherwise they will go like nah i'm already having this guy on a payroll so i'm
gonna go with his story so you have to bring something new something different about that story
and it's about how you look at the world and i think i've always had that look into the world
in a different manner that most of the people and it's just a matter of how i see it and how
i perceive stories and how i perceive the world and so i used to pitch like a shit ton of fucking
stories of course some of the editors were fed up with my pitching they were like fuck man this is
too many fucking stories really so i had to come up with different outlets right like okay i'm not
gonna pitch 50 stories to business insider and 50 to buys and 50 you know i was like i'm gonna find
20 different news outlets and pitch everyone a story that it's more catered to their needs right
so i know that buys has a certain style and certain they like certain type of stories
business insider is different the daily beast is different cbs is different new tv like
netflix shows and everything like that it's different so so i started like caring for everyone and
i'm a fucking workaholic so i'm working almost 20 hours a day and they ever like fuck with your
stories at all like the editors like try to get you to change stuff and make it like sway it
like make it weird a lot and i used to and i somewhere along the way i lost my my my willing
to push the to the right story so i'm willing to push back against against some shit but very
recently i recovered that that will that will you know to push back and and say like hey i'm not
liking that i'm i'm not happy with these are not happy with with that or the way you're saying this
because it's not necessarily true you know you have a sub-stack right yeah yeah i have a sub-stack
account where i post most of the stuff that goes out from my editors right like that interview with
a chap's attorney um with el chapo's attorney oh i think the main thing was to paint a different
picture about el chapo about emas coronel ema coronel his wife and about how the attorney ended
up being the attorney of the fucking most notorious truck cartel uh boss you know and
and about how he felt that the us needs to go against politicians of both sides of the of the
wall of the border uh but when i pitched that didn't didn't ring the editors the editors needed
something more simplistic right they wanted to talk about the uh the role of woman in the narco
world and if i could speak to the attorney about that the role of women in the narco world like how
there are how women are stepping in more and more getting more involved in better places
better places well more more high up above in the organizations which is pretty cool
but to me was like a waste of time talking about that with el chapo's attorney right right um so
yeah i mean they wanted to fit yeah they wanted to fit into certain things that they think work for
them and i think it's it's cool i mean it's it's uh that's their that's their job and they're like
most of my editors are really respectable people and really respectable journalists
but but at the same time that some like some some stories are not their feet right and instead of
like sending them in straight to the trash bin i started a sub a sub stack account where where i
post most of those stories that don't really make it or didn't make it like the way i was receiving
that news and maybe going raw you know like putting yeah i mean i'm sure that's that's the goal right
is to be a completely independent publishing your own shit because if i can think about any of the
most any of the most notable journalists or reporters that that i actually think are interesting
or pay attention to they're completely independent they're not staffers for fucking business inside
or or vice you know i mean these guys are completely doing their own thing their rogue in
in a sense which is fucking hard on on the financial side of it you know you need to
fucking work a lot to make a decent living out of that and and the thing is um the the whole
the whole thing about how payments go because they pay you uh 30 days later after publication
and you have to submit a name voice and pay your own taxes and sometimes they're late on
talking about sub stack or talking about like the publications publications oh yeah so yeah so it's
you have to be a fucking mastermind of the accounting you know to have your
accountants on check and and not face money gaps you know so at the beginning when i started
freelancing like 10 years ago uh i i faced a lot of fucking money gaps where i did i my money flow
was not well organized and sometimes i was like what the fuck i have zero fucking money for the
whole month that's fucking crazy and and then i started like working on that right working on
on setting better prices for my stories saying no to publications that want to low value um
and being more smart about invoicing and you know like having a fucking whole thing organized when
this is the the day that i show invoice because i'm getting paid up until the next month right right
so i need to pull more stories to the next month to make up for that so it's it's a hard thing to
balance when you just want to like go do the fun shit like i just want to be creative and
and do cool shit i don't want to fucking worry about totally because you're i mean you're taught
up enough with talking with these people trying to set up interviews traveling on your own money
all that shit and then after that you're still gonna have to go to all of your financial stuff
you know like getting paid and the invoices pay your taxes all that shit so it's it's it's it's
a lot of work yeah man so it's a lot of fucking work yes um when did fentanyl become first come
on the scene in mexico i mean i know it's been going on for at least since since 2015 but over
the last two years especially i feel like the fentanyl thing that the opioid and the overdoses
with fentanyl have been just skyrocket yeah the thing is the crazy fucking thing is uh
fentanyl it's a story in the u.s but it's not a story in mexico because fentanyl is not
saying in mexico no one is doing fentanyl in mexico no one is consuming fentanyl in mexico
if you go to any city like siro juarez or culeacan or monterey or whichever city you go
cancun or whatever and try to get a pill event you're you're not gonna get anything you can't
find it not even in monterey no too funny story about monterey i have a bunch of mexican friends
and uh they taught me i used to know spanish like very well like i could speak it i could
hold a conversation like somewhat at least and uh i would try to convince like i had i'd
bet my my buddies like i bet you i could convince him i'm mexican and i would he would just i mean
like i would like get little tips like how could i convince this dude i'm mexican he goes just say
soy de monterey all the white mexicans are from monterey of course yeah you cooleasely
play that out that's fun yeah so yeah i mean it's impossible to get pills because this the same
criminal organizations have have it uh prohibited right you can sell fentanyl in mexico to mexicans
that's all for export um well the fentanyl in the us is like hidden though right like it's not
you're not actually buying fentanyl people who are dying are trying to buy other shit that's
cut with fentanyl yes exactly but there's two ways fentanyl is getting into the us uh one it's pure
fentanyl where they where they ship pure fentanyl so people in the u.s can cut their own shit their
manufacturing here uh where they're manufacturing in well they're getting it from china well the
manufacturing like the pills exactly yeah and they're and the other is the actual peels or heroin
or coke uh laced with fentanyl and shipped into the u.s here's one thing i don't fucking get
how is there's no way people are intentionally cutting coke with fentanyl i don't think so
because it's the complete polar opposite drugs if you're going if you want to keep selling your
coke and you're giving people coke with fentanyl i mean you're not going to keep your clients for
very long no i don't i don't think so i don't think so at some point i was convinced that that was
a myth that coke mixed with fentanyl because i i found no proof but then i found proof in the us of
u.s law enforcement who started sending me um results from analysis drug tests where coke was
being mixed with fentanyl but i think and i'm guessing that has to be unintentional
yeah exactly i read an article and i saw i i a guy was basically i guess he was just going
around doing coke in different cities and or asking coke dealer testing coke from different
cities and i think what the analysis was is the people who are buying like shit from the street
like the shitty stuff from like low level drug dealers who are selling you have low level drug
dealers who are selling cheap shit to poor people and these guys are selling coke and heroin to the
same people and they're cutting it on the same fucking table so they're accidentally getting
a little bit of fentanyl in the code but the people who are like the rich people who are buying
it from high level people who don't mix the these guys aren't selling heroin they're just selling
coke so you're not going to get it cut exactly that's that's exactly what i think it's happening
because there's no i mean it wouldn't really make sense to cut your coke with fent right right
but i mean on on my own experience i've never found someone who was actually telling me like
we're cutting coke with fentanyl i have never and then there's this craziest stories about weed
laced with fentanyl weed laced with fentanyl right and it's like how and why you know it's i don't
know man it's uh it might be happening not that i'm aware of you know not that i keep reading stories
but it's how i was from sketchy news outlets that they're putting out this super fucking uh
you know like uh so the people in the u.s that are dying the the large majority of people who
are dying from fentanyl what is it how is that happening are they intentionally taking fentanyl
or is it just the the vast majority it's an intentional overdose of taking some something
that it's laced usually this fucking pale perk fake perco the fake percoset peels the fake blue
peels yeah those that shit i went i went into a laboratory in tinaloa of fake percosets and
dude it's i mean it's it's crazy how how that shit is how the other manufacturing those peels in a
small fucking apartment i was i was in one of those biggest labs two years ago i think or
three years ago in tinaloa as well and the thing it used to be very different it was a huge lab
in the um in the outskirts of of kulyakan um so it was like outdoors lab you know like what you
think with with huge fucking burials of precursors and shit and they will do huge fucking batches of
of fentanyl laced um like paste that they will turn into peels press into peels later um but then
apparently this year el mayo ordered the whole fucking industry to make smaller
labs all over the city more labs but smaller the smaller quantities so if they will get busted
they will just find a lab and they wouldn't lose that small amount of exact right so i went there
last year um to one of these small new labs and i mean they don't even know what they're fucking
getting right they just they just got a chinese man a chinese chemist straight from china to teach
them how to fucking cook peels mixed fentanyl uh because everything all the precursors and
fentanyl's come in straight from china to the sinaloa cartel so who's sending the chinese chemist
the chinese the chinese triads which pretty sure the fucking government
holy and who's paying this fucking chemist the sinaloa cartel the cartels paying the cartels yeah
both both cartels uh sinaloa and cartel jalisco are paying like the same um group in china right
and this chinese chemist came come here will come into mexico and they teach both on different
places and different um dates and everything like by separately but but it's the same guys that are
showing both how to do shit you know whoa and it's it's crazy so i went into one of these labs and
is this one of the labs you went to yeah exactly that's exactly that's that's the lab i i was the
lab i was uh i think last year wow and that's one of the sinaloa chemist that was recently
you know shown by shown by by these chinese chemist on how to cook those peels so this was
a chinese guy no that was a mexican guy but he learned straight from this chinese guy and he told
me how he told me how um he basically said like they said the chinese came here and he was like
i'm gonna be here for three months and you're just gonna watch how i do shit every single time i do
when you batch you're just gonna watch and after three months i'm gonna you're gonna you're gonna
be on test you're gonna make a test for me um and if you're ready and it will ship that
shit to the us and the shit sells and the customers are happy with it and everything
then you're ready to go otherwise i'm gonna have to stay here another three months and stuff so
that's how that guy learned how to how to make peels whoa he's like okay at the three months
he stopped and he said like okay you're flying solo i started cooking he just watched and watched
and watched i made a whole batch we shipped it over um and the shit was good uh they have a test
that i show on the on the video how they how they test the peels for quality and apparently they
they use a foil paper aluminum paper and then they put the peel and they start burning the paper and
if the peel slides that that that means it's a good quality peel and if the peel gets stuck
that means it's a shitty batch and you have to do all over again now is this because the fentanyl
is cheaper than what they used to use yeah man i mean what are they used to use just opium yeah
they used to they used to do heroin basically heroin yeah but um fentanyl it's not that it's
cheaper but it's um you have to use less of a quantity to right to make it like super fucking
you know strong they have addicts in the city that they test peels with as well like they give
them a peel or two and that's gotta be a crazy thing when you're making a giant batch of those
things like yeah if you could just put the he put a little bit too much fentanyl in there
actually one of the one of his helpers one of the helpers of these look that he's uh he's testing
that he's testing the peel for quality oh is this what he said when you when it slides to make sure
it slides if you see the peel slide the peel will stuck that means that's not a good peel
wow but that was not the proper laboratory yeah later that night so that other guy on the on the
yellow echoing yes no we're good that that guy on the yellow uh thing um yeah he was just out of
the hospital because they fucked up over uh a pack of fentanyl of pure fentanyl what they do is when
when i was there and when they were gonna throw the fentanyl into the mix they asked me to go as
far as i call from them and i was wearing a fucking mask like uh you know like a proper mask not
not like a right you know like a face mask from covid or whatever it was like this gas mask i was
wearing like breaking bad exactly yeah and they were like can you get away as far as back as you
can because when they closed windows they sealed everything because they were like if we pour the
fentanyl the potter and and you inhale some of this shit you're fucking done the guy in yellow
was still shaking because he was just out of the hospital because he fucked up and he nailed
like basically he threw too fast the potter so the dust um came up you know the it lifted some
dust he nailed that seven days in coma and that was the the day that he was just out so he was like
when they put the fucking fentanyl into the mix they opened it like super slowly and they threw
like and he was like he was like super fucking scared you know to do that shit and then they
started like mixing the whole shit and they're pressing the pills the only thing that they
didn't let me um record was the the pressing of the pills they were like super sketchy about the
about the machine about the presser i was like that's in fucking amazon you know it's super cheap
and easy to find why is like i don't know when my boss told me specifically you're not gonna record
the the presser really all right i mean they allowed me to record the whole fucking precursor
the whole fucking thing the whole apps and everything but the presser so all but all of the
actual like raw like raw fentanyl all of it 100% comes from china yeah 100% yeah
i love it coming from china sometimes it comes from um germany but coming from china so it went
out from china stopped in in germany to some organization in in germany and i was shipped
over to uh mexico coast called montany now has anyone ever tried to figure out who like who
specifically in china they're getting it from i mean i'm getting a lot of uh a lot of uh uh
of stuff from there but most of them are saying triads and then they keep sending me names of the
triads and stuff but then i i'm talking with a guy that he used to be like an i don't know if
it's some something like an undercover's working for some u.s sketchy organization in china he was
recently blacklisted so he had to go out from china and he's living in taiwan right now because he
was looking into that shit uh and he told me that it's the the government the chinese government
it's like it's a it's a um chinese the communist party that it's allowing these shipments so is
this like i guess the the big conspiracy spiritual question is this like China trying to get revenge
for the opium war that happened between the british the british like sold tons of opium to china
like way way way back in the day and like really fucked up china i don't know if it's i don't know
if it's revenge but but honestly it it looks like it seems like a conspiracy theory you know like
when you when i when i talk about that everybody's like well that sounds a little bit of a conspiracy
theory but also sort of like races right and i'm not trying to be either both i'm trying to be very
objective for what i've seen with my own eyes and reported with my own sources and if you were china
and wouldn't that wouldn't that be a great way to attack your opponent that's the only way they're
fucking diminishing the power of the u.s that's their only way in the u.s right mexico's having these
um these new or renewed diplomatic relationship with china commercial relationship with china
china is opening more to mexico financially and economically we have more diplomatic relationship
with china than before with this new government um china is sending diplomatic people to greed
um governs like nicaragua that are openly socialist and blacklisted by the u.s venezuela
so they're making their moves everywhere the u.s is fucking up right and that includes mexico
the relationship between mexico and the u.s has never been at the lowest you know as it is today
really yeah man it's it's awful it's never been that bad i mean not even during the trump
administration that was pretty hard on immigration and mexicans and everything i mean this this time
around with this administration that relationship is going south super fucking quick in every in
every single issue you know but specifically on security the cooperation between both countries
it's shitty i can't say it's not for the best maybe for mexico's i understand what the mexican
administration is trying to do which is gain independency and say like okay my issues i'm
gonna take care of my issues and you take care of yours because your help has not helped very much
right funding the fucking drug hotels shipping drugs in exchange for fighting the guerrillas back
then and all that shit it's not working for us right for mexico and i understand that but at the
same time you have to keep certain diplomacy right certain relationship especially because we're so
tied together and these administrations closing ever they just closed these special unit in mexico
handled by the dea that has been going for fucking ever and that was the unit that
captural chapel and several other main kingpins and the mexican government just closed that out of
the fucking blue they're just like no this is a fucking corrupt organization it's closed and that
was a main issue for the u.s government is like how the fuck are you closing the dea had forever
for years had these operational plane installed in mexico in the mexican airport and the mexican
government just asked them to take that plane out of mexico you know so it's like okay take your
fucking dea plane out of mexican soil get it back to the u.s so they had to and that was pretty hard
a hard fucking act against the u.s right cooperation the u.s arrested general cian fuegos one of the main
army top army guys in mexico and mexico had to go in and rescue that guy and set him free in mexico
so they got mexico got in full on government to say we need you to give us back uh cian fuegos
which is like the baddest mother fucker arrested on a u.s airport for helping the sinaloa cartel
openly and he was arrested under dea custody and mexico went up to say okay i'm gonna kick out
every single one of your agents and diplomats in mexico because we were holding him if you don't
release him back to us so that's the extent mexico is going against their relationship to in to the
u.s and china is watching all of that shit right they're like oh you're fighting with with the u.s
so let's be friends dude that's fucking scary it's crazy man so essentially the entire mexican
government is controlled by the by the cartels yes i think i think right now it's really hard
how much influence do they have on like the the very top like the president like how much influence
is there i think i think a lot i think a lot more more than more than everybody thinks really um i'm
not saying that it's as like they call the president and say like what to do but they definitely
have the means to pressure his agenda right by taking out armed people into certain strategic
places like let's say the mexican government is trying to open a new oil refinery or processing
center or whatever or a new hospital in some city so the bad guys will go and i don't know kill a
couple of doctors or um you know shoot the whole fucking scene or kill a family around the area
where they were supposed to set up a new school stuff like that to pressure the government to do
their will right to hand them contracts for the construction of a street of a hospital or of a
new i don't know department complex or whatever they're making a lot of money out of legal money
legal contracts of construction specifically for roads that they need to transport um drugs right
so they're like we need this road and the mexican government like well there's no fucking money to
do that road it's like all right so let's pressure your fucking government one way or another so
you feel like you have to build that fucking road right and that we're gonna get that contract
also so they own the construction company that's building the road are they are some they're
somehow getting a percentage or extorting them somehow i guess a good percentage of the whole
of the whole construction around mexico is handing is handed by cartel members right
under under their um that's fucking the bananas it's crazy man that's i mean it's it's it's it's
it's up to the point where it's really hard to say that there is a government and that there is a
cartel or cartels it's the same it's the work like so what do you do like what are you like
how do you handle that how does the us handle that like especially when not only is it a fucking
narco state but when you have china siphoning fentanyl through there it's like a it's like a
it's like a proxy or just like a trojan horse to get fentanyl into the united states which is
fucking up young people and like killing a lot of fucking people in the country
i don't know man i don't know that's that's a that's a fucking question i i make myself
like every time but i guess i guess the us does better to a country when he stays out of it you
know like when when they don't involve actively in trying to help a country right right right
when they are when they stay away from that country that's that's better for that country right
because i mean unlike ukraine you know that's that's because there are war full on war right
that's that's a that's a that's actually a war it's not a threat a civil threat or something like
that right and what would it be if the us hadn't put billions of dollars of weapons and shit into
that country you know would it be a war yeah well yeah who knows but how how did afghanistan
end up right they don't end up well four either um on duras guatemala mexico el salvador panamá venezuela
cuba every single one of the heidi every single one of those countries has had a lot of intervention
intervention by the us trying to help and all of those countries are devastated devastated and
it's and it's becoming an issue and it's back lashing into the us because a lot of the migrants
are from those specific countries where the us had um stepped in right a lot of the migrants from
those countries are from what do you mean yeah like basically the us trying to help those countries
in fact yeah more than actually help is back lashing into the us because most of the migrants
getting into the us are actually from those countries right right right yeah that makes
sense a lot of people from heidi venezuela cuba mexico salvador guatemala has anyone else talking
about this thing with about how all this stuff is coming in from china has any has any like
one reporting on that mainstream like because i haven't seen that anywhere until i really started
digging into it the thing is it looks very conspiranoic right the thing is that narrative
for editors it's a conspiracy theory even though you hand out proof right even though if you are
bringing like interviews and all that stuff it's still for most editors it feels like
i think we're more on the conspiracy theory right there right and i'm like well because
there's no there's no definitive proof obviously because that's their intention exactly but if it
was their intention that's what they would do yeah right exactly because of course i mean
if you're when you're an editor what you need is proof right and you will need a proof of the
chinese government saying yeah let's fucking kill a lot of us citizens with fentanyl going through
mexico no one's gonna fucking say that right but you can have a proof by showing where is all this
fentanyl coming from and why is it not affecting mexico right right it's affecting specifically
the us it's not drug i mean mexico and its shipping drugs are longer right they're shipping
shit to europe middle east asia africa they're shipping fucking drugs to every single other
fucking country us of course but fentanyl it's only being shipped to the us fentanyl it's not
shipped to europe it's not shipped to asia it's not shipped to middle east it's shipped specifically
to the us and that's because that's what the bosses in the cartels are asking right this is only for
the us this is well why only for you because there's only people taking that shit in the us i guess
that's what makes us fucking suspicious right you see because there is only a demand in the us which
is fucking weird that the demand will be only in the us didn't happen with coke didn't happen with
heroin it didn't happen with weed that goes everywhere everywhere and math you know that that
demand is worldwide because it's the same fucking drug worldwide right what has has the amount of
coke gone down has like the the amount of money and and the the volume of cocaine being trafficked
has that gone down since no it's actually going up as well um you know the us also has funding a
lot of the drug war in colombia against against drug traffickers and they just nabbed this narco
called otoniel right who were they funding uh the colombia government they're funding the
cloning government to fight the to fight the drug hotels they just arrested this guy who was like a
chapel for uh colombia right it was called otoniel but when you look again at the figures of coke
being shipped from colombia into into the us it's an all times high and it's again it's like it's not
working your strategy is obviously not working the colombia has never produced more cocaine
in the whole fucking history as of right now wow it's crazy so they're getting all the big bosses
and their organizations keep shipping shit tons of money maybe it's because of covid maybe people
just sort of lonely they want to do more fucking drugs they want to do more coke sure yeah covid
definitely skyrocketed the the um the drug business and that's for sure yes and it's the same is the
same is it as violent have you ever been to colombia yeah is it the same what's the main
differences between like the cartels in colombia and the cartels in mexico i think colombia is i
think i think mexico it's colombia 15 years back right i think we're moving into that direction
straight straightforward meaning it's more meaning colombia got so mixed the drug trafficking
problem and politics so fucking intersected you know pablo scoward he used to be like a congressman
he wanted to be a president so he mixed the whole fucking organization with politicians and
politicians on his organization so that changed the whole fucking thing um also the the guerrillas
that used to be guerrillas and not traffickers but now they're traffickers saying they're guerrillas
right there's this group called clan del golfo which is basically cartel del golfo um but they say
that they're they're called the autodefensa the autodefensas garitanistas de colombia right so
they are a guerrilla or a self-defense group uh but they're not they're fucking traffickers
the fark as fuerzas uh revolutionaries of colombia the main guerrilla group in colombia
they used to be a guerrilla right fighting against the government and trying to gain autonomous
territories and all that shit they are the ones cooking more cocaine than every other
single organization in colombia dealing in venezuela colombia panama they're fucking everywhere
they're huge and they used to be guerrillas right so mexico we don't have guerrillas
but we're about to all of those groups from autodefensas what does guerrilla mean
uh guerrilla guerrilla okay yeah sorry sorry you said it the proper way didn't i yeah yeah yeah
guerrillas yeah exactly so all of these guerrilla groups i mean they're not they're they're traffickers
these guys that's guerrillas right we're not mexico is still not at that and that in that
point in time right now but we're going to we're going to i mean these guys i don't know if you've
read this um manual there's a u.s army manual on insurgencies and country insurgencies movement
and there is established like a one by one point on how does an insurgency group build
stop right and they start basically by unstabilizing governments doing certain actions and and if you
look at that guide and you look at what's happening in mexico it's like dude we're on the final fucking
phase of these guys becoming an armed or mixed insurgency which is like a drug trafficking slash
insurgency groups operating in mexico they're not only cartels right now that's why i usually refuse
to call them um cartels or drug cartels and it's more like organized uh insurgencies right because
it's it's it's it's totally different now it's not the same they're wearing military bass military
dress they have uh they have their armed groups which is one of the requirements of the insurgency
right you have leadership and then you have a circle of uh an armed group that it's going to
protect you or attack you know and then outside you have what it's called social basis which is
basically the people supporting you on certain region you want to get control of and they're
getting a lot of social bases around mexico all of those gaps we're talking earlier um that's how
they are getting social bases all through mexico so people today respects more a drug trafficker
than a politician if they say who is who's giving you more who who side are you gonna be of and
they're like of course i'm gonna be on the side of el mayo instead of the fucking governor of my state
right because they feel they're giving more and that that's how they're gaining social
bases and that's fucking crazy because that means when the time comes they can't ask people to go
out against the government and throw a fucking government out and they will step in right so
and then you'll have a fucking mess one of the articles that you wrote was about their problem with
getting guns uh dealing with the gun manufacturers in the us like there was wasn't there some sort of
law that had to get passed to sort of like restrict the amount of guns being trafficked
because like the nra had something going like the nra had some sort of thing going on with the gun
manufacturers where they were able to illegally ship guns into mexico yeah well the thing is
in mexico it's almost impossible to get a gun legally right uh to get a by the way you want to
drink yeah i offered you this earlier it's uh it's fuck it's whiskey it's actually not bad
it's pretty good looks good it's like single malt whiskey awesome let's go for it so yeah it makes
it good it's really hard to do they get straight or you want ice uh it's i'll just straight straight
very cool to to get a gun right the the legal way they're like that looks super good it is good
but if you try to get a gun illegally you'll have it like cheers cheers man let's get fucked up and
talk about narcos let's do that that's why i'm here not to not to drink water yeah for real
should have offered it earlier i'm just kidding man wow this is good pretty good
so so yeah i mean that and again only the bad guys are uh are having guns in mexico they
they are the only ones with guns in mexico right if i want to get a gun in in juarez to protect
myself that's fucking impossible there is no way they say there is a way the proper way and you
can apply for a fucking license or whatever but it's impossible they're never gonna get approved
right and if you get approved it's just gonna be like a small handgun whatever and these guys are
dealing with fucking ak's and a lot of other like big stuff um 50 colts and all that shit and
and it's like what am i gonna do with a fucking handgun yeah that video that you sent me with
those those kids those foot soldiers wearing out 50 caliber snipers exactly man what the
fuck are you gonna do if the mexican government is allowing you to carry a handgun against all
those fucking guys right so that's that that's that's that's for for one side and and the other
side it's mexico is pushing a lot to sue most us gun manufacturers trying to blame them because
for the whole shit that it's going on in mexico right so the mexican government what it's saying is
you are as responsible as the criminals for what is happening in mexico because you know
that you have to bet better the people that is buying guns from you of course the us companies
are saying like that's not our fucking fault we're just selling and producing guns for a us market
and if they end up in mexico or whatever else that's not our problem i honestly think that's a
political stunt from the from the this politician that wants to be president next after this
administration and he's doing good because he's getting a lot of legitimacy in mexico right
everybody's like wow he's the only one stepping up against the fucking us manufacturers which i
don't really think it's gonna do something right are the us manufacturers selling directly to the
cartels no directly well not like that not like they're shipping shit tons of guns directly to
two cartels and shit but they're getting like massive fucking orders of shit lots of guns to
organizations or companies in mexico yeah exactly and and that's the thing not only in
mexico but also in the us because they are allowed to right but but if they are if they were to really
vet who are who is getting their guns especially very specific shipments of a shit ton of fucking
aks a shit ton of fucking ar-15s a shit ton of 50 calls that's that should be enough to raise the
alarms and say like okay let's let's have a look and who's buying all this shit from us right
maybe we should look i mean and when we check their fucking id or something their background
because when you look at them and i i had i had looked at the fucking list and said like okay so
this is supposed to be a company that is selling guns out of uh whatever then you go and it's a
small house you know passo an east till passo from a single fucking guy just sitting outside his
porch and just sitting like that and telling guns to every fucking body they would have to the
least amount of work possible to actually do any sort of like research to find out that this is
like a 500 square foot shack in mexico easy you know they're probably this like a fucking billion
dollar gun order exactly and when i met that guy he's a mexican guy with called louise as well
and i was like so here's the i don't know i can't remember the name of the store but let's say i don't
know guns um company and it's like yeah it's like but this is a house it's like yeah man i'm allowed
and i'm like so you have a permit it's like yeah i just need to the eight send the list of buyers to
the atf every month and i'm like dude but what if i come here and ask you to get two way case
five fifty calls now are you allowed to sell that and i'm like yeah i mean as as long as you give me
your your id and i'm like dude but are you aware that most of those fucking guns are going to end
up in mexico and it's like dude i have clients from whatever i don't ask questions i just give me your
id and i'll send them to atf if there's an issue atl will reach out to me and say like hey someone
bought this gun from you or whatever and i ask them like has it happened and it's like yeah
and then what happened nothing i mean i'm just selling guns right let's see well i understand
what you're saying but still so how long i mean the question is how long until fucking
there start buying nukes from the us i don't i don't even think the cartels ever buy nukes
but i don't think they need to man i think they have more than fucking enough to to get us all
on our knees you know i mean it's uh super fucking even a small nuke yeah like we'll take
out your state or we'll take out your city you know if you fuck with us they don't they don't
fucking need to that's a thing they they can't take the whole fucking city if they want only by
the amount of people look at what happened when they tried to capture el chapo son in kulyakan right
they got nexican government went full fucking on with a lot of bugging army guys helicopters
everything tanks like on war to capture one guy that is actually like 30 years old some shit like
that and when they got him in his house he just made a call and hundreds of fucking soldiers came
out from nowhere from the fucking sewers from houses around and they made a they paralyzed the
whole fucking city for the whole entire day they started killing people they went into the maximum
security prison to 300 of fucking people and all of them all of them like started getting armed and
go against the army they went into the army there's an army base in kulyakan they went there and
tied a lot of grenades and and how do you call it a d like the fucking proximity
mines land mines to the gas tanks of the where the families of the soldiers were leaving and
said like okay man if you don't let our guy go we're gonna blow the whole fucking military base
where your family's staying right and they parallelized the whole fucking city and that
happened in like three hours they had to let that guy go so they they set him free and they just
went back into hiding so if they want they can take a whole fucking city without the use of
anything else but the amount of people working under their instructions right god damn bro that
is so crazy where is El Chapo son now in kulyakan uh yeah he's living in the outskirts of kulyakan
um of course if i knew i i will be i will be getting myself five million fucking dollars
if you knew where yeah because that's the that's that's the five million dollar question that's
it yeah yeah that's what what if you had the opportunity to like go meet him and like interview
him well dude i'm i'm i've been trying that for a fucking while but if they were like we
gotta fucking put a we gotta put a bag over your head we gotta tie you up and throw you in the
fucking bottom of a of a truck wouldn't be the first time i i went to a place like that like
i'll you know like with shit in my head i mean i've been in places like that in sonora you've
been to places where they had to like literally blindfold you take you there yeah i mean by yourself
yeah by myself Jesus wouldn't wouldn't be the first time so i will i will be like yeah for sure
man let's let's do it i mean if if he offers me a fucking interview that would be you just said
that you would take the five million dollars or so where is that no hey if you if you're watching
this i'm not taking the five meals i'm taking your interview he definitely watches this podcast
what was the story there was a story about uh you were in a safe house or somewhere and there
was like a they ordered tacos yes so that's that's the time where they blindfolded me and
and started okay i went to meet i went to meet one of the caro quinteros family right operating in
sonora um caro quinteros is this uh sinaloa cartel founder as well that got arrested and um he is
he's accused of killing kiki kama rena the dea agent in in mexico um although most of my sources
said that it was not caro quintet it was actually the cia who killed his dea agent but that's a
whole story that's the story of narcos well the last last night yeah yeah yeah so this guy
how do you say his name again the caro quintero el el caro quintero uh so he's still running around
and he's still pretty active he was he was in jail for several years after the yeah he got busted
after the kiki exactly kama rena exactly murder and then he was in jail and then he was set free
for two hours because the judge said he he made a mistake on the ruling right so the attorneys
submitted a motion and the judge was like yeah you're totally right um kiki kama rena was not
a federal official um person in mexico because that was the that that's why he got so many years
he was not operating as a federal he was undercover he was from the us so he was just like a citizen
so you just killed a regular citizen a foreign citizen in mexico and i thought he worked for the
dea he worked for the da but under the mexican law he was not officially a federal agent in mexico
or a mexican federal agent and he was so because that's what he needed that status to stay undercover
exactly so you just basically killed a foreigner in mexico and you served that time for for that
for that crime right they set him free two hours later he was like oh no my bad we need him back
of course he was already hiding well protector right right and um yeah during those when they
showed that footage and they were interviewing him and he was just like nonchalant smiling kind of
like laughing and giggling and like he was very like matter of fact answering the questions like he
knew what the fuck he was doing yeah yeah yeah and he seemed young back then back then what year was
that it was 87 exactly he's yeah exactly and uh there was a recent interview i think it was like
three or four years ago when he was just recently out a mexican journalist uh found him and and he
gave her an interview and he is he's like in a shitty place i guess in the mountains you can hear
a lot of fucking rain and stuff and he's saying like i'm just uh i'm just a farmer and i did what i
did but i paid for it and i was not involved in anything i never even knew that guy camarena
whatever that they're accusing me of right um who knows so that we're getting a little bit off track
but that audio uh they they recorded the audio of torturing and interrogating that dea agent kiki
camarena is that audio available to the public no so no one's ever heard it no i i've been described
the audio by by um hector berreyes who is the last dark uh by hector so hector has heard it yeah hector
has heard it so did they have the actual full audio version of that when they made the documentary
where like where they had they didn't even have the full no no okay they just had like people's
memory of it exactly yes exactly um and so yeah anyways i went to to visit like a source of mine
told me that they can get me a uh uh to to to talk with one of caro kindero's family
a nephew from caro kindero's working and leading the organization in sonora
so i went there i was staying in no gales and he called me to meet him up in a place called
caborca which is like two hours i think two hours or something like that from no gales but it was
like 11 p.m right when they called me and said like hey you need to show up here and i'm like
i'm two hours away and he's like okay so if you want we'll be here and i drove in the middle of
fucking night alone all through fucking sonora to go to that shitty place and of course he had
left already so i was like shit so like can you call him back tell him i'm sorry i'm two hours away
i'll stay here stayed there for until like three in the morning and then i drove all the way back
to fucking no gales to my hotel the next night again the same shit call me up to meet him there
again there i am again in the middle of fucking night going back and then back because nothing
happened it was like four times that that happened and the fifth night he actually showed up showed
up with uh you know you know you went back for five fucking nights yeah it's like driving back and
forth in the fucking middle of nowhere um and then on the fifth night he showed up in this beautiful
takoma you know uh and and he was like a regular fucking person with a shirt um a white guy you
know he sort of like looked like you but father he was american yeah he is american but i mean
well he's a mexican but he's a u.s citizen okay but he happened to be quite completely white
okay so he was from on our eyes basically yes um and we started talking and and i had an interview
with him a full interview on what he was doing and how he got involved with the cartel and caro
organization all that shit and then he told me well so you want to go and look the the warehouse
and i'm like yeah of course so he blindfolded me uh put me in another car one of his security guys
we started driving i knew exactly where we were because i had fucking driven that road five nights
in a row so i knew every single bomb but every single turn right so we went into uh we went into
a small town called pitiquito which is in between where i was staying and that city caborca
um but not i don't know exactly where but i knew we were like somewhere deep into pitiquito
and then he showed me like this small house uh and he's like that's the warehouse so i entered
the house and there was nothing just like an old man having a tecate right and i'm like but where's
you have no drugs here like and he's like it's fucking full drugs and i'm like put wear on the
roof and it's like open the open the warehouse so this guy started like sweeping the it was a dirt
road started like sweeping the dirt road um and then he he pulled like a like a like a i don't know
like a thing like a door yeah like a hatch like double hatch and then they had a stairs uh and then
back down back there inside that that thing underground it was like full of fucking weed it
was only weed but it was like completely packed it was a place i think was bigger than this place
twice this place i guess and it was like completely fucking packed with with bricks of of weed and
they had the whole whole um accounting uh notes there so they i could take a look at everything
they allowed me to get a look at everything so we recorded the whole fucking thing it was a it was
for a show called dope on netflix um how's your filming yes i was i was producing uh that that
documentary for netflix and um so we filmed the whole fucking thing and then we went out i don't
smoke weed but the the two guys that i was with um the cameraman and and and another um cameraman
as well they both they do smoke they're um they're from the uk and they were like this this fucking
weed smells good and i told him like hey my guy said your weed smells pretty pretty good it's like

started like rolling and smoking and we're like having fun and we're like that's pretty cool and
he's like i'm like no one in smoke is like no me either you know i was like oh that that's that's
good it's dea exactly um so yeah we're just like waiting for them to finish their fucking joints
and and i was having at the gate there in small talking uh and then he i got a got a call on his
radio uh they usually use like encrypted communication so someone talked to him when he's
walkie and said a couple of code words you know something and he was like okay we kept talking
and then like five minutes later ten minutes later someone let the call again and then he
started like getting tense and i'm like is everything okay it's like sort of can you guys

what happened is like i have three rings of security and there is a convoy of federal of
federales and they already crossed the second ring of security the third ring of security it's just
right here in this block so if we see them here getting across that we're gonna engage into a
shootout and that means they're they're following you i'm gonna assume that they're following you
and i'm like dude i mean i don't even have my phone and you know well not not on though it's it's
off and it's like whatever man um so let's uh let's pray for for for them to stop the at the
last checkpoint and i'm like all right we stay there i was fucking shitting myself it's like
please please please please please because he didn't even we weren't even talking anymore
we was just like sitting there i'll quiet you know before small talking and laughing and having a beer
alpha zoning was like silence and i was like fuck you know we'll look around so like there's
nothing but fucking mountains around here so there is no fucking way i can run to anywhere
so i i we stayed there and then they call him again and i was like fuck and then uh and then i
called here they told him i know they were they were coming to eat some tacos to the to the
corner with that with that with an old lady that sells tacos in the corner not like mother
couldn't you fucking pick a different place to go for tacos it's uber eats yeah so yeah he was
like no they were eating tacos so you're good there you go let's go bro we drove but straight
that kind of shit is terrifying that was fucking crazy yeah yeah i got i got scared that time
fuck um one of the things i want to ask you i was in uh a couple years ago i think two years ago
i was i stayed in uh Puerto Vallarta for a couple weeks and sayelita yeah and uh i read a couple
articles saying that those areas including places like cancun are really highly sought after turf
for the cartels because or not for the cartels but mainly for like the smaller drug gangs because
they want to sell to the tourists are those areas those places like cancun and uh and uh
ported by by art uh are those places becoming more and more dangerous yeah definitely the thing is
you're not only dealing with straight dealing which is a lot of fucking money for tourists right i mean
the tourist um the tourism industry buying drugs in tourist areas it leaves a lot of money because
they overpriced every single fucking bag of cocaine and shit so they make a big buck out of that but
also most of their resorts if you look at the owners of their resorts in mexican it's a lot of
italian people from romania russian it's a lot of fucking mafia from we're talking mafia from
from korea korea um italy russia romania uh all over the fucking world but mostly those four
places they own a lot of the real estate in those high tourist traffic areas because they're
they're laundering money from their own organizations through those uh resorts right and
not only laundering money but also it's uh it's it's private land it's so it's private beaches
so by night you will see a lot of fucking small boats um the three in the morning
getting there and going out from there right so they're shipping a lot of drugs also from there out
from mexico mexican drug to europe right to a lot of like europe destination or asia destinations
wow so they're making a big buck out of there so mexican cartels are uh try we're not not trying
but they're looking to break a bigger deal with them right to make the biggest part not only not
only asking them for um look what they call uso de suelo which is basically i'm charging you for
operating on my turf you're giving me a percentage of what you're doing on whatever the fuck is that
you're doing anything because they're they're on um human trafficking you know sex trafficking
selling drugs shipping drugs laundering money those places are hot spots for fucking
crying all of that shit um so prostitutes cocaine yeah so so so the mexican cartels are like well
we don't want just a piece of your business now we want in and they started like fighting killing
moving and the whole fucking dynamics started changing around those places so right now
they're becoming dangerous places not because they're talking targeting uh tourists but because
there's a there's a fucking war between tourists they're just like collateral damage a lot of damage
yeah yeah and when you heard that they're killing they killed a canadian they killed an asian like
almost all of them were targeted because they were part of the organization right these two
canadian asian canadian i would i think it would like korean or vietnamese canadian what's the deal
with that fucking monkey that got shot yeah that narco monkey what is the story behind that
that story is like i don't know if to actually laugh or cry because i mean i mean why will you kill
a fucking monkey right first of all why will you have a monkey completely oh there is a
tactical dressed right rest in peace rest in peace bro those things are fucking can be ruthless when
they want to be really i mean i i know i had a friend that had one but i was so fucking scared
bro i've seen videos of those things like ripping people's scalps off and their faces off i mean i
was completely your balls off that's what they do for sure i don't know if they were actually using
him as a i don't know it's a weapon you know like attacking people or protection or whatever or they
just find it cool because he was properly dressed right he had his his tactical vest and the and
the camo the sweat like sweatshirt yeah i mean he was all dressed up what what was going on like
why did he get shot uh he was uh apparently he was the pet of one of the uh one of the guys from
la familia michoacana which is uh which is a cartel in central mexico in michoacan and mexico
state they are they're huge so apparently what happened is that a few a couple of members of the
la familia michoacana went to the police station the state police station to to shoot the the police
station to actually shoot on the the police officers so they started into a gunfight they
started chasing them they went into a they tried to hide in one of their branches in Mexico state
and one of the bosses had a spider monkey with him and so he was like a casualty of the gunfight
i'm not sure i'm not sure about that because there's that photo of that monkey laying on the side
of a man allegedly his owner but there's another photo i think it was not as popular as that one
there was another photo where he was actually on top of him oh really so i don't know on top of his
owner uh huh like on on on his chest wait go up scroll up there's one with like a red circle
yeah click that one no he's on his shoulders and i think that's a different photo that was around
but was not from him um yeah i mean so he was just essentially a pet of one of the big narco
guys yeah exactly so i don't know if if i during the shootout they kill him or they actually execute
the monkey right it's i mean it's it's weird to even be wording those saying those words so
fucking weird bro execute a monkey yeah man what did they put like a fucking suicide vest on him or
something they yeah i mean have the monkey like run out and now he has his own corrido right his
own songs it's they're called narco corridos which are songs that tells the story of big narcos right
so the chapo has the narco corrido the monkey has his own several corridos and now the spider monkey
has his own narco corrido someone composed the narco song for a month for a little saying that
it was not his time to go and then he left the legacy click on that one with him in the clouds
in the cross yeah that one wow yeah i mean mexico right you don't know if to actually to laugh or to
cry that's just crazy yeah yeah yeah yeah so the russian mafia is just specifically there just
basically because they're shipping they're there to control stuff that they're trying to ship back
to russia yeah or they're they're just trying to make money on there's like small russian gangs
that are in there they're just trying to make money selling drugs both i mean they they're open both
there was a there was a reason to arrest and a guy called let me let me find his name because i
haven't here recently he was not russian he was romanian oh romanian um i thought the russian mafia
was down there yeah also yeah it's it's the russians and the romanian mafia is down there
um i can't remember his name but anyways he uh he was recently arrested in in cancun because
tudor his last name was tudor tudor and everybody knew that he controlled most of the
hotels operating in cancun he operated a street truck selling a sex trafficking ring and he was
laundering money for romanian and russian organizations out of out of cancun so i mean
he was pretty fucking huge because he even got um there's photos and video of him uh on a public
meeting he had with mexico top security chief uh rosa isela whatever she's she's the top security
chief for for for mexican government he got together with her to ask her for more um protection in
cancun because he was getting dangerous and whatever and offering also his services to yeah
if she needed something and in cancun and all that shit because he was allegedly a business owner
right but um but the interpol had an international investigation out of them so he got arrested
his organization is still going a lot of call centers also where he's laundering money and making
a lot of fucking frauds um and it's a us call centers established in mexico because altarsing
is cheaper but he's controlling those those call centers in cancun aren't a lot of the
fucking uh us car manufacturers based in have manufacturing plants set up in mexico yeah there
are a lot of them like gm and like for don't they manufacture a shitload of cars in mexico
are those controlled by the cartel at all no not really but um how the fuck do they stay
like away from the cartel down there i think they i think it's they're just not a not a huge
target i think they're more problematic than a target for the cartels right because they're
bringing more attention imagine what will happen if if you will have a cartel threatening or
kidnapping or try to get into one of the fucking ford plants right so i guess what they do is they
deal they're not going to deal with government and government ask them like just don't fucking
mess with these guys because it's a whole lot of inversion of uh investment that they have in in
mexico so don't fuck it up right i guess that's what they do different from what they do with mining
mining companies before establishing when they're chose when they're on the um exploration uh face
of of a mine uh mine where they where are they mining uh a lot of um um silver copper uh a lot
of minerals and now lithium uh there's a lot there's a huge fucking lithium deposit in what
parts of mexico are they mining that shit in the border of sonora and chihuahua imagine that like
really sinaloa cartel controlled place fuck so the mining operations and guess who has the um
guess who who has the um the um contract for that who china of course no the chinese company
has the contract for exploiting that that mining that uh lithium and the car tell us and touch that
yes of course oh they do they're in i mean they're not they're in on it yeah they're partners with
china well they're they're giving uh protection to to the china china's company that is mining there
so they made a deal with the government and with the china's company mining company that is the
biggest supplier for tesla cars for tesla batteries uh whoa dude that's that's i mean i've
been working on that fucking story it's still not out because i still need a lot of more sources and
papers and untangle the fucking story but i pitched it like a year ago uh they said yes
and i'm still working on it slowly but shortly but uh but yeah that that company this is the biggest
this is one of the biggest mining operations in mexico it's the biggest in mexico and one of
the biggest in latin america and it's owned by china in partnership with the sinaloa cartel
well it's right now it's only the contract for exploration right to explore okay there are just
how much uh lithium there is or whatever but there are studies already proved that it's the biggest
deposit of lithium so they're just setting up they say on paper they say they're just setting up and
exploring if there is but they could very easily be already taking it but when you go there and talk
to the um to the residents around the area to the local residents it's a very small town in the
outskirts of in the middle of fucking nowhere they are actually now working on setting up the whole
fucking plant right so i'm like but aren't they they're just exploring they're like no no we're
setting up we're we have contracts to work on construction and we're setting up to start
exploding the mine right mexico is threatening to um nationalize all lithium because they say it's
it belongs to mexican government but it's still i'm i barely got out of public high school so you
gotta explain to me what nationalize means that that means uh that means that the whole um lithium
will belong to mexico so they will give a permit for you to or for china for whoever
to exploit the and do the job but the actual um mineral it's it's mexico's property got it right
so that's what they're trying to do the mexican government it's threatening companies and doing
that and of course it's making a lot of fucking people nervous about that right so but for the
time being they handed the contract of exploration to a china company it under a subsidiary like it's
like under a smaller company um a partner company uh mexican company that didn't exist until like
two or three years ago it's called bacanora lithium bacanora lithium so that's supposed to be the
mexican company but that bacanora lithium when you go on the webpage and see who's the owner of
bacanora lithium is this biggest china company that is the main supplier for lithium uh for tesla
right so there's there's an interesting thing going on there and when i spoke with some of
the senegal cartel members around that area they were like i was like how's that playing out with
you guys because i know that's her territory and they told me no we got hired to give out protection
while they do the work and i'm like by who is like by the chinese company by bacanora right by
bacanora lithium the mexican company but it's owned by this china right the biggest company
so they're protecting the area that means they are threatening kidnapping and killing
families that don't want to sell their land they owned to the to the company right they're setting
prices for the chinese company so if the chinese company wants to pay them i don't know one buck
for a i don't know a mile of land or whatever and they don't want to sell then the senegal cartel
jumps in and says start threatening those guys or killing them until they sell the land for what
the chinese company wants uh so it's a big fucking shit going on that with lithium and it's i mean
it's under the radar of course because on paper it's still and then on the news it's still on
exploration we're not even sure there is lithium there oh my god where else are the is this company
in china getting the lithium from where they're selling it they're the tesla's biggest supplier
i think bolivia uh and i don't know if you if you go into that company if you go to bacanora
lithium and then you find that i have all the fucking documents and they're getting from from
a lot of places bro china is balls deep in mexico and not only in mexico man i mean they're the
biggest they have tesla by the balls they have ellid musk the bigger the biggest fucking i guess
the biggest fucking um businessman in the us yeah by the fucking balls richest guy in the world yeah
if they have lithium they're gonna control the fucking future of cars uh ford is gonna start
making a lot of fucking i think every car making right they're every call here i think somebody
said that i think if somebody in the biden administration said that by 2025 90 of cars in
the us will be electric so i mean if they control one of the biggest or the biggest lithium um
deposited in mexico or in latin america china is gonna have are there any teslas in mexico
yeah people drive teslas yeah not just somebody showed me a video yesterday of in california
there was like fucking a line around two blocks wrapped around two blocks twice waiting in line
to get the charge that was uh that was a tesla that's an old video from to that 2019 i think oh is
it Thanksgiving it was like it's uh it's uh it was called something like the uh the tesla
something whatever but it was like there was no electricity or something happened but whatever
people on thanksgiving had to go into that specific place to charge their right but it's an old
video it's a crazy i the thing the only thing i worry about it with tesla is electric cars is
that in florida we get a lot of fucking hurricanes yeah and we lose power for multiple days on end
yeah at least once or twice a year during hurricane season i think that's gonna be an issue right
so i think that the that's the one reason like i think that one little thing like that one little
thing is like makes me fearful of it but like i think about all the i don't like it's weird when
you compare it to all the benefits i'm sure the benefits way farther away than when you
really think about it those fucking benefits are not really benefits i mean supposedly the benefit
is um for um the environment right right they're not gonna be emissions right but what are you
gonna do with all those fucking batteries what are you doing with your iphone right with your
phones and and ipads and tablets what do we do with all that shit it's become it it it's waste
that it's gonna be there for fucking years contaminating the fucking environment what do
they do with it you know they bury it yeah i don't know i mean many of us with just your cameras
whatever the batteries yeah many of us just fucking throw it on the trash and that's contaminating a
lot right if you do it properly you're going to our deposit right to to to live your batteries and
iphone and all that shit but but what are they well elon's whole thing is like we're eventually
it's it's inevitable that we're gonna run out of fossil fuels at one point that's what he says
so it's we might as well start now because we're gonna run out of fossil fuels but i think even
he said he said that the um the batteries the lithium that we're using to make these batteries
is not the best option he's like we eventually gotta move past that and figure out how to get
into nuclear powered cars like he talks about getting into nuclear i mean i don't know but but
honestly with with the lithium it's like okay the batteries are gonna start piling up on your
fucking backyard every time they stayed on work right right contaminating maybe more than the
emissions of a fucking gas car and the other thing is like the mining for lithium it's uh it's
called open mining which is the worst fucking thing that ever happened yeah it's not it's not
underground mining they just basically blow up full fucking uh mountains and shit and the in the
mining it's it's it's open it's at the open right it's not closed or underground right and that
shit contaminates like 100% more than any other fucking type of mining that that it's saying too
much right like underground mining contaminates a fucking lot because it's exploding the land
open line mining it's like 100% worse so in order to get lithium it's open mining
what kind of damage does the open lithium mining do like what is it it contaminates the atmosphere
i think the atmosphere yeah exactly goes straight to the atmosphere and and the i think the whole
explosions that you need to do in order to get to the to the lithium also are very like harmful
for the environment i think apparently like it also has a lot of emissions um yeah so i think it's
i think it's like when we talk about lithium i think it's just a trend a trend you know like
like saying like it's cool cars and it's and it's a cool trend yeah but not really not necessarily
better than what we're doing right now right right yeah i had one for a while and we sold
it because i had so many problems and i think we're looking at getting one of the uh diesel cars
yeah one of the big suv's that come with diesel because it's way better you know diesel's worse
yeah environment i mean we're going from the electric to diesel the diesel yeah i mean it's
crazy but i think one one of the one of the solutions wouldn't it be to actually have maybe um
lithium driven public transportation like instead of using a fucking car you're using
a railroad or a or a fucking bus and then we're we're using a collective fucking
car right we're using a bus we're using a train or some shit like that and it's and that's electric
and that's not making emissions so using batteries but not a single two or three batteries for per
home right right and less traffic less of that shit yeah i mean there's already less of it
because this is the way the economy is better way that people have been working since covid everyone
works fucking from home now yeah like nobody exactly and that too yeah that measure i mean
it's helping right yeah and i'm sure even especially in your industry in journalism and
then publishing and stuff like that i'm sure i'm sure 99 of fucking reporters and journalists
are working just straight from home and reporting on stuff from home and that's pretty cool i mean
that's uh yeah that's a big push for the environment stay fucking home don't move yeah
don't commute do you ever think about like think about the idea if in the future this whole america
mexico china thing turned into like what's going on right now with russia ukraine in the us do you
think that could ever fucking happen like a sort of like a war sort of how like
like ukraine is just like this proxy area that the us is used or that the us is using to push
against russia and to fight against russia and it's like this middle ground it's like this turf
that they're using to wage the war between you at the us and russia because you know it's there
it's russia's main border between the rest of the e you the rest of europe and half of ukraine
is divided half of its pro russia half of its pro e you um and it just from what i'm like
understanding from this it seems like it's almost the same thing with china and the us and mexico
kind of just being that fucking middle ground whether they're using exploiting mexico to
fucking hurt the us and and i'm sure it goes the other way as well but like it seems like it's kind
of the same thing it might be man i mean i don't know if a proper like high intensity war is what
what is happening in ukraine but maybe like a low intensity war right where you don't have
right missiles and you know right all that stuff like a proper fight but you're using it as a proxy
what i'm not sure of is if i'm sure that china is using mexico as a proxy and i think that's
gonna be happening more and more intense through the years but um but i'm not sure that the us can
use mexico as a proxy to china right no i think the us is gonna go what taiwan maybe taiwan yeah
there's a deal where they legally have to defend taiwan right yeah so i think taiwan's gonna become
more like i think taiwan is more on the verge of being a proxy um i think it's i've heard people
say that it's basically inevitable that china is going to try to take over taiwan i think that's
where that shit it's going to happen and we're legally obligated to defend them exactly or turn
them into a porcupine or whatever and try to keep them safe yeah so maybe maybe mexico just becomes
like leverage or something for china yeah exactly it's so weird this whole geopolitical balance
so crazy and it's crazy for the middle ground countries right like mexico especially the middle
ground countries we're not fucking with anyone what are you guys fighting here over whatever
the shit you're doing right because i mean fentanyl is it's uh it's uh i'm indirectly
hurting mexico as well i mean we're not having an issue on people using fentanyl but it's being
cooked in mexico it's being shipped over from mexico so that means the army the us is uh
uh pressuring mexico to go and fight a fucking undeclared war on our on our cities you know
that's affecting us and our families and everybody who lives there so i mean it's fucking bullshit
well what do you think it would take to get mexico out of the state that it's in and like what
what would it theoretically take to fucking get rid of these cartels and without the us i'm saying
like independent of the us like what would it really take to fucking turn mexico into a a sovereign
country that is not fucking corrupt and overrun by all these criminal organizations i think it will
take to it will take a lot of fucking people to lose a lot of fucking money so i think that will
change the the situation in mexico it will it will have and not necessarily like not not straight
like okay let's take all the money from these people and then now mexico's good and i'm talking
about like if you legalize drugs if you actually work other countries have to legalize drugs yeah
exactly yeah exactly and and mexico including mexico because i mean it's a huge consumer as well
but not as a us the us definitely main consumer europe right now antwerp and uh netherlands it's
it's a huge fucking port for for the netherlands are like huge stuff it's the biggest port right now
getting getting drugs how much is as high as the us i thought there was countries over there
that had legalized drugs like fully but but i think that's why they're using that port to get
drugs that's why it's convenient oh wow and and the corruption in that port it's called antwerp
it's huge like everybody's fucking working for the cartels right there so yeah i guess
so it's the fucking it's the goddamn fucking churches it's the christian churches that are
fighting against keeping drugs illegal that are fueling all these fucking deaths bro yeah man i mean
it's that and that conservative thinking yeah drugs are necessarily bad and you know i mean so
fucking crazy because you think if you legalized all drugs like deaths would a hundred percent go
down exactly and and and i know what some people believe that so also everybody's gonna use but
that's gonna be a way different easier problem to solve the problem of addiction it's not gonna be
the fucking it's gonna be a health issue right right it's not gonna be a security you're fighting
only the people who are abusing stuff and getting addicted and you're not fucking fighting
tons of criminal organizations who are straight up fucking slaughtering people every day it will
definitely need years and years of education and of helping addicts and all that shit right
but it's it's gonna be a different fucking fight than actually having cartels controlling
full territories and killing people and killing monkeys killing right murdering innocent monkeys
spider monkeys yeah there's a country i forget which country it is but they have
they have a special program there where heroin's legalized and if you're a heroin addict you can
actually go and get like supervised doses of heroin from a doctor and where you're not on the
street fucking suffering like using dirty needles and stuff like that exactly man i mean the whole
fucking world is we got to a ridiculous point of hypocritical thinking i mean in in every single
fucking sense right the governments are against these uh helpers that they go and deliver clean
needles to addicts in the streets and they go hard against them and they arrest them and put
them behind yelp those if there were like drug dealers they're like those guys are trying to stop
aids from spreading from the use of fucking syringes right you should be help helping those guys
um and that's the same thinking where i don't know what happened in in um this recent shootout
in chicago right in highland park and if you think about that and it's like that it's the same
talking about the parade the fourth of july exactly and and and and what i'm talking about was like
the hypocritical thinking that guy was posting videos online he was had like millions of um
listeners on his spotify whatever because he was a rapper the shooter yeah yeah are you serious
yeah he was a rapper he was a fucking rapper you gotta find this bro yeah he was a fucking
rapper and he had like millions of listeners and and and he was talking about like massive shootouts
he posted videos of how he was gonna go and shoot into like people like he was all all there right
and you say like okay the us is looking all over fucking phones or apps they have all over
fucking information but they can't get a guy that it's openly saying that it's gonna fucking kill
people it's like talking about like reproduction um right rights right right there are on their apps
of every girl tracking their fucking tracking their periods right my wife just fucking deleted
that app off her phone because they're there they're sneaking up on those fucking ass but they
can't fucking sneak up on a guy openly talking to a million of people this kid's really a rapper
yeah brobert cremo he was called awake the awake the something dude i saw something where he
wow he really did have a spotify yeah awake the rapper awake the rapper yeah
yeah and i saw some sort of post where he said that he was a product he was part of mk ultra
man the cia is fucking mind control i mean he might i don't know if it was but he's uh
that's a screenshot of like all of those photos are the screenshot of a video he posted that it's
very fucking disturbing this video where in the smiley face shirt yeah what do you do in this video
can we watch it i think i think it's a video can you find the video can we watch it
just click on if you click on the picture it should pull up the video
yeah it pulled up the article yeah right there where says visit don't put this on the screen
though because i don't want to have to get fucking banned by youtube yeah
yeah the video should be it's on his uh i can't remember what's the name of his beat meal account
see this is the problem too we're fucking talking about it on a podcast and like
giving this guy more attention this is exactly what he wanted exactly
yeah but it is a problem though because we have and i mean the fucking with the uh
all of the surveillance that the fucking nsa does on their phones and the way that
the government regulates facebook and controls social media and tries to track people's information
so they're tracking people women trying to get health products or services but they're not tracking
those fuckers right so i did we are all thinking wrong we are so fucking hypocritical we need to
we need to set that fucking straight how is that gonna fucking affect texas that abortion law
i heard that it's gonna be like the day one you find out you're pregnant it's completely
illegal to have an abortion i'm i'm not sure but i'm that's what i'm hearing to i don't know man i mean
that's your state yeah i mean that fucking statement honestly i'm fed up with that state i mean
like texas as a as a land but their laws are just so hypocritical again right
and gun laws you what what are the how does hard is it to get a gun in texas it's nothing it's not
what do you have to do nothing just go and go and get one literally just show up with all
fucking face tattoos and neck tattoos and they'll give you one literally then no for sure i mean for
real that's that's what's going on and i mean i'm not i'm not i think the whole debate between
the uh gun law if we shall be able to or not able to i think it doesn't really matters
because if you look then again to mexico right and if you say like let's prohibit everyone for
nobody is shooting up schools in mexico that's not happening in mexico but still
there's a lot of fucking people getting killed in mexico right i mean how did i work for mexico
to being so strict right but the other way around is also what i'm trying to say is like it doesn't
really matter it's it's a wrong debate it's a wrong conversation we're having about like gun laws
doesn't really matter it has no effect into what's happening in the us with the with the
shootings and and all that shit right it's not about guns if you want a gun if it's illegal
you're gonna get one it's gonna happen what happened in mexico right it's easier to get an
illegal gun than a legal gun if you if it's legal you're gonna get it as well i think it's a matter
of education those guys are a product of something that's wrong on their houses on their schools right
which guys the school shooters yeah the guys like the highland yeah there's something fucking wrong
because yeah i don't know if if it has ever crossed your mind doing some shit like that right
and in most of us that grew up i don't know we you always got a bully on your school you always
got bad times or whatever but you never think about i'm gonna bring a fucking ak and shoot
the whole fucking school right right something has happened to those guys and they're not getting
enough attention and something really fucking bad and it's not gun laws those guys aren't saying
like oh i can get a gun let me go shoot i mean it's easier for them of course but it's harder in
mexico but we're still having certain people fucking kill the day different problem but
lives going as well if you want something you're gonna get it if it's illegal just gonna cost you
more yeah if it's legal it's just gonna cost you less you're gonna get it if you if you want to
kill someone and have a gun and make a fucking massive shootout the problem is not how easy it is
for you to get a gun the problem is why are you fucking even thinking about that right
gets us that's that's main issue the also another part of the problem is the fact that
the media and politicians in the u.s specifically they just use this as political ammunition
just to get more power exactly they don't give a fuck whether it's illegal or not just a matter
what's gonna get them more votes or what's gonna get them elected yeah now again i'm not i'm not
one of these guys that's saying like let's all have weapons or whatever i don't own and i don't
plan to own i just don't like weapons you don't like weapons at all i don't really i mean no i
mean i've seen just too much out of them that i that's interesting coming from a guy who's been
around yeah i've been around been around too much to like them you know yeah um yeah so i'm not i'm
not against them but i'm not super fucking fan of guns right right um but but but at the same time
i think like if you make them harder to get your what you're gonna do is you're only gonna create
a black market a few ones a couple of people that's gonna make tons of fucking money out of that
fucking industry you don't want a black market market of guns in the u.s right that's i mean
that's gonna add up to the fucking problematic yeah so prohibition whatever it is it never works
never fucking works it only creates black markets it only puts more people in danger and only feeds
the pockets of a few so yeah it's a it's a weird thing like the difference between mexican and
america is in mexico the violence stems from an industry right a black market industry it's like
life or death like trying to put food on the table and agreed like greed like making more
money and and and turf ego businesses and stuff like that control and and here like when you're
talking about school shootings even though it probably adds up to way fewer deaths than the
deaths that come from the cartels in mexico it's almost like it's from like things are too good
here yeah and you have people who are just isolated and and fucking ostracized from their
fucking groups or their their school groups or whatever it is there have fucked up parents
and just like the culture here in general is so much different than there because it's like
it's almost too good here yeah yeah exactly exactly man exactly that's what that's what i've been
talking with a lot of people living in the u.s and they feel like like things are just too easy in
the u.s that it makes people sick you know it makes people feeling lonely and and they and the other
country is like the big fucking the russia's and the china's will exploit that yeah to work for
like russia you'll see it with like propaganda and like the new like like the media like trying
to manipulate that kind of stuff or trying to try to manipulate the mind rather at least in history
throughout history and then when you have things like what we're talking about with china and and
fentanyl allegedly if that's what their intentions are trying to manipulate the weaknesses of america
that way yeah i mean and and again the the media it's not helping right because every single one
of those fuckers they always leave uh something like a manifesto or a video or something they
want the fucking attention and they keep getting the attention they keep getting their names all over
the fucking news their faces their videos their rap songs their manifestos it's like let's just
fucking keep ignoring those mother fuckers so when they go out and think about like i'm gonna
shoot a lot of people for nothing because no one's gonna fucking remember me anyways i think that's
gonna that's gonna keep them probably it's gonna keep them like from doing that because
they're not gonna feel important right they're not gonna feel like they're gonna change something
right yeah it's more of a public suicide than anything just like how can i commit suicide and
create the most attention yeah it's like it's like the kid that's calling for attention by
harming i don't know the cat his pet or his pet or whatever yeah and he's like just fucking throwing
the fucking room i don't know man it's a it's a hard it's a harder thing to to have an answer to
but uh but i'm pretty sure that that guns has nothing to do with it yeah no i agree um
bro thank you for coming all the way from mexico and doing this i think we're almost at like three
hours three and a half three three two hours 45 minutes like that my fucking average went out
of battery bro it's been uh awesome tell uh people watching and listening where they can find out more
of your find more your work your your sub stack everything all you know where they can follow you
for sure man uh if you go to uh my website l chaparo l c h a p a w r o dot com you'll find my
youtube channel where i'm trying to be as active as i can but i mean i'm fucking swamped and work
but every every time i find some interesting clips uh when i'm embedding with curtows or with
us authorities or um i did an embedding also with the border patrol along the along the border
to find out how they are arresting and who are they are resting along the border and that stuff
so every time i do something like that i will post it in in youtube um also you'll find there
every single one of my stories regarding um crime and immigration drugs um and if you go
there where it says uh one detail insights on security click here that's my sub stick account
where i post um more of like the raw information it's it's called confidential and what i try to
think of confidential is like where i post that raw stuff uh that it's not curated or edited you
know it's like raw interviews raw auto interviews um a raw article without being properly um spell
checked spell check and you know like all that shit or or yeah exactly more like raw shit and a
lot of you can get out i like that better because it's more raw you can get it out when people
are being more raw and trying to just get stuff out rather than sitting on it for too long yeah
exactly i enjoy that shit more because i used to like be the same way i used to like create like a
lot of like documentary style stuff and and spend months on one project and when i transitioned
doing this stuff it's more like it's more authentic because you can you can basically just get right
to it you can fucking like me like fumbling through my word trying to learn as i go exactly but you're
able to put out a lot more content yeah exactly i enjoy that shit more and sometimes in the news you
can't post like the names you know like who's controlling sonora and who's controlling chihuahua
and like who gives a fuck right but i i do give a fuck and sometimes i just post photos of like
this is the cartel boss for chihuahua and this state in this region and i'll post like their names
and photos and you know like more detailed information that it's not really making the news
because it might not be newsworthy but it will it will keep you aware and informed and educated on
what's going on in in the whole fucking crime world in latin america so yeah i guess that's the
that's the way to go and and of course my my instagram account sometimes i will be also
embedding talking with someone sharing stuff that i get shared by on your instagram is awesome
bro you're super active i'm super active i'm super active on my instagram i had to do one thing you
know and i guess that's instagram and i'm posting a lot of shit there all the time cool man well i
will link it all uh in the description and thanks again thank you man it was really fun and thanks
for the whiskey yep goodbye world
