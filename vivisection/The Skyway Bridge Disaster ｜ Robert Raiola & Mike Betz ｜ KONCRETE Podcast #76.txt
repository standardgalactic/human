Bob Ryola and Mike Betts are former Florida DOT divers who were in charge of inspecting
thousands of Florida bridges over the span of their careers. Their job was to dive under every
bridge and thoroughly inspect each piling for structural integrity below the waterline.
On May 9th of 1980 at 7.38 in the morning a freighter hit the Sunshine Skyway bridge over
Tampa Bay. A 1400 foot section of the bridge collapsed into the bay killing 35 people.
And my two guests today Bob and Mike were the first divers in the water that day
to attempt to rescue and retrieve any victims of what is now known as one of the worst disasters
in Florida's history. I must warn you this conversation gets graphic and extremely tense
at times. Without further ado please welcome Bob Ryola and Mike Betts.
All right we're live. Thanks for coming on guys. Oh thanks for having us. You know it's been a
while coming and we certainly appreciate the opportunity to tell our side of the story.
Yeah your guys' story is super fascinating. For the people out there that don't know could
you please just give me like a brief background each of you on to as to like where you came from
and what your background is. Well I joined the Florida Department of Transportation in
May of 1980 having just served about five years in the Navy. I was an underwater photographer
diver in the Navy and when I got out the Florida State Employment Service pointed me to a job in
Tampa with bridge inspection and I went over and interviewed and Bob hired me and we went from there.
And yourself Bob. Unfortunately I didn't have any choice in where I was born but I was born
up north in Connecticut in a small town called Clinton where I taught myself to dive but about
16 joined the Marine Corps did my time in Vietnam got some military training in diving ended up
working for the Department of Transportation was hired in January 1974 after several years as a
commercial diver after I left the Marine Corps. Back then we were statewide there was only
eight divers in 1974 that covered the entire state so we basically divided up into
four different sections and we traveled all around statewide and did every bridge
that was longer than 20 feet and deeper than two foot of water
uh for the about six or seven years and then we were assigned to a district one which is on
west central coast of Florida covered about 14 counties fresh and salt water same routine
provided inspections to ensure the safety of the traveling public for the Department of Transportation
strictly underwater that's what we were we were professional commercial divers
so that was the beginning of that and I got my uh tutorship under a fellow named Vic Griswold
who was the second DOT diver hired in the state in 1969 the first diver hired was a fellow named
Dick Barthol the bridge inspection program didn't begin until 1969 so I got in kind of in the
basement and Mike did as well it was uh pretty interesting back then so it was a lot of one
on one training and a lot of water time a lot of water time is it right when you started that there
was two divers in the entire state of Florida that whose whose job was specifically to inspect
these bridges all around Florida and there was there's hundreds of bridges in Florida right
absolutely there there's about 12 there's currently ballpark about 12 000 bridges in the
state of Florida not all our water bridges but 12 000 bridges give or take probably about uh three
or four thousand water bridges December 17th 1968 northbound across the encloak river the bridge
collapsed US 19 US 19 that's right up there in Tarkin Springs in Pinellas County one person lost
their life immediately the media suspected sinkholes because we did have sinkhole problems
back in Florida back then there was no DOT bridge inspection program period in the state of Florida
above water or underwater there were very few in 1969 that tragedy brought forward legislation
that was passed in 1969 that mandated that all of the bridges in Florida would be inspected once
every two years according to national bridge inspection standards out of Washington a young
fella named Edward Kett who is still pretty active at work at Campbell Kissinger over in Tampa
was assigned that responsibility of creating and developing and putting together a bridge inspection
the first two divers hired were hired in 1969 and there were only two divers
two divers that covered the entire state wow when that bridge collapsed it was later determined
that it collapsed based on the fact that the piling were constructed out of steel they corroded
to a point that led to failure they then understood through that legislation that it needed to be
corrected to ensure the safety of the traveling public and to let them know that that bridges
were being maintained and taken care of when they were hired the immediate task was to inspect all
steel bridges in the entire state just the two of them they did it for about four years and they
hired two other divers named Pete Gatti Jack D now there were four divers they split the state
basically up into four sections north south east and west okay and as a team they all swept around
and did as many bridges as they could starting with the steel inventory inspecting from scratch
there was nothing there was nobody even had an idea how many steel bridges there were
from there they eventually completed that task and then they went around and did all the timber
bridges because there are a lot of old bridges that were created back in the day out of creosote
timber piling especially down south it was really no yeah quick and fast with concrete roads on top
of them they over decked them eventually back in the 30s and 40s when they started building
bridges out of timber they just had plinks okay they eventually over topped them with concrete
and and asphalt you know as the applications came along there's some fantastic pictures
of the old alligator alley and being created in the 30s and whatnot that show that very well
very well they found obviously that the majority of the problems were going to go ahead and be for
some of the older bridges many of them have never been inspected so those those divers
ended up hiring four more divers which created eight that's when I came aboard in 1974 so eight
divers in 1974 that's correct and there was only two man teams that's the way it was set up
everybody understood and understands now of course that the best way in the safest way would be three
man teams sometimes if you're out in the water the two man team having one guy in the water is not
always good having two guys in the water is not always good best would have been three however
in 1969 the wait wait did you say the best is to have three divers in the water at once no no
would be a misspoke would be to have a three man dive crew so that you could have one diver in the
water two divers in the water and somebody qualified to watch them okay in the water rather than just
have two divers and have them both in the water with nobody with nobody on top have one guy in the
boat watching the other guys bubbles you know it doesn't work that way the best way would have been
however in 1969 that's just the way it was uh 1969 nobody had any idea that the waters that they
were getting into as you can imagine they were full alligators they were full of unknown hazards
like pollution and contamination some of the waters back in the 60s and 70s were considered
industrial uh canals and stuff uh fen hollow and some of the bridges up in the panhandle with
the paper products jacksonville some of the fertilizers and pesticides and shit but the chemical
i don't want to get anybody upset but it sounded like the chemicals that he used to
create paper products they had a lot of problems with the well i know now the discharge so how
to have been worse back then yeah with the discharge yeah the water quality back in the 60s and 70s
it was kind of atrocious yeah i can remember diving in the sky for the first couple of times
it was miserable and then back in the 90s you know when i left it was
significantly better and we began to see a significant change but back in the day when
we were doing the inspections their eight-man team we were based out of Orlando uh ovedo
technically and we traveled all around the state and did our inspections we eventually were absorbed
by the districts but then again we were still in west central florida so we had that responsibility
in the skyway so i had uh by the time the skyway accident had occurred i had a good
four or five years of firsthand knowledge and experience diving on that structure
how did you guys meet he came for a job interview as uh he advertised he didn't tell him you
worked in the paper for a little bit you worked in the paper car used to be a stringer for the
old clear water newspaper what's your stringer shooting uh freelance shooting pictures oh okay
you know just picking up weekend assignments things like that that's awesome yeah it was fun
the application uh back when we had dark rooms ancient technology yeah mic mic applied for the
job as a diver back in 1974 the minimum qualifications for a dot diver dive inspector
or five years full-time commercial diving with military training or military diving experience
a minimum of five years it was not a recreational activity it was not a sport activity it was not
a fun it was commerce it was work so in other words we didn't get to choose which waters we went into
whether it was cold whether it was warm whether it was clear whether it was dirty whether it was
full of critters and not full of critters critters defined critters is a widely defined term i feel
like you live in florida however i can honestly say and i think my can too i'm eight full critters
of big teeth so happy that we no longer have to dive out there you got now you've got lionfish
oh yeah you got the crocodile population has exploded the alligators are off the endangered
species list we should have been on the the uot diver should have been on the endangered species
list back in the day and said the alligator however that's just where it worked out so you
said you needed military diving experience did you what did you do did you actually dive in the
military yes what did you do in the what did you do secret secret can you just give me like my
military specialty was a third in vietnam right yeah fine so the vietnam muknyan chintram
chamoyi by chamoyi tom dochon i want me muknyan chintram chamoyi tom yes i was in vietnam
in 1967 and 1968 sorry we're out of that and i returned in 1968 yes i was in vietnam i had combat
experience really you were combat yes yes and so did you do a lot of stuff like obviously i don't
know much about that but did you do a lot of underwater stuff with my diving experience
i had the ability to blow up anything that they wanted blown up whether it was above water or
underwater my military specialty was that 1372 which is a nuclear weapons technician so i was a
19 year old marine with a key to the nuclear weapons locker holy shit that's pretty crazy
but a secret we can't tell anybody that yes no i was that's intense 1372 that's intense so you
were more than qualified to be a dot diver inspecting um these bridges i i met the qualifications
and like i said we had one on one for five years that was a minimum before you got your
certification was five years on the job training one on one so yes yeah we did so how many bridges
would you say you dove and inspected over your career oh my goodness go ahead mike i can tell
you that this thing a little bit closer to you when you're talking i can tell you that a typical
bridge inspection crew and i'm talking about a topside crew would get a approximately depending
on the size of the structures um you know discounting the large Howard Franklin Courtney
Campbell ties but normal three five 10 15 20 span bridges a crew of two people might get
30 of those a month to inspect um of those perhaps 20 maybe would be bridges over water
and would require a dive team to to come in and do their part of the inspection and then the top
side crew takes the dive report combines it with their inspection findings and reduces a standalone
document that uh reflects the underwater in the top side so 30 a month times 12 months times
30 years i don't have a calculator but it's a lot that's a lot yeah
and i think probably because i was strictly diving and we covered actually two districts
by the time i left uh thousands thousands and some of the longer ones like the skyway
when when you talk about doing the skyway the skyway isn't the scariest bridge i can think of
um good good that's what steve urwin said too steve urwin came out here and dove on that one
time and said really the scariest one yeah uh i don't understand why why is that scary i have
not some i mean there's scarier bridges scarier bridges that we have even in finales county
probably one of the scariest ones for me would be john's pass because it's right there right on
i feel like it's scarier because there's so much water like there's so such a big distance between
the each piece of land john's pass i could i could hit a golf ball over john's absolutely
which concentrates all the bad things in one spot doesn't it oh interesting so what's so
scary about is john's pass would you say that's the scariest channel you've done dove well number
one it's right on the water like sabastian and some of the other ones it's almost impossible to dive
whatever you want you have to pick your time cautiously and carefully because of the current
because of the velocity four four five six feet a second that's pretty fast back in the 70s and 80s
there was a lot of uh commercial fishing going on and a lot of the commercial boats came into
john's pass that's a group of capital of the world on the west coast of florida and they would
fillet their fish and discard the carcasses near the pass because that's where most of the
commercial fish houses were there was a lot of traffic in and out for following the boats
people fishing swimmers it was also 50 feet deep people don't realize that it was 50 feet deep
they recently replaced it due in large fact that many of the piling had completely washed
out and become unsupported and were dangling in the air or dangling in the water so it was
you know replaced and they put a fantastic new structure up there velocity fish animals they've
had several drownings there people getting sucked off the into their pass and the current stuff
it's pretty dangerous boat traffic pretty narrow also we didn't you know necessarily
back then have three people in the boat like they said a lot of times we retire a boat up and just
both of us go in to make sure we're okay in the water so there's a lot of stuff that made
different bridges here there were some bridges down in alligator alley
that you know you really had to think twice and look twice before you went in there when they
opened that up those alligators had never seen divers before i can get into you run into alligators
when you were diving those bridges frequently really well that's how do you get how do you uh
what do you do when you're underwater well i tried to call mani but i couldn't get mani to come out
mani needed one of those try dents over there he's gonna go ahead and go out there and lift
them up and and play with him and stuff but uh mani i how you doing you know i just i'm not
not mani um unfortunately we've had we've had a couple of brush ups with with some alligators and
stuff that didn't end up very well for the alligator because we're both still here but
you know we don't look for it it's just one of those things if you're in florida you can almost
always count on bumping into an alligator in the water and especially now with the population
generally they're they're not territorial or aggressive they they're more likely to retreat
than attack is my experience and my experience because i dove with the dott a little bit longer
than mic was if you get a construction crew that's out there feeding them for three months
they're left over lunch yeah then they usually are pretty interested in seeing what you're gonna
bring in for lunch when you get in the water so it made it kind of interesting we had a hard time
a lot of time we would stop down any everglades at places where the people would stop in the
bus and actually feed them even though they weren't supposed to be back then oh i can say it made it
more difficult to do our job it's just part of that thing that you signed up for yeah it makes a
lot of sense how now that i think about it that there is so like such a narrow channel in john's
pass it makes sense that there's so much more sea life coming and plus with the fishermen and everything
and and people and boats how how deep is can you explain what it's like on a typical dot how many
times did you dive the skyway bridge i i had i'm going to say 22 years of diving out of the skyway
bridge so i that that's kind of the skyway like every other regular bridge in in florida gets
inspected every two years every two years okay some structures that are weight restricted for
whatever reason or have structural deficiencies that the inspectors want to monitor more closely
than a two-year cycle can be as frequently as 12 six even even three even one month they could go
look at a structure every month to make sure that it doesn't need to be closed so when you talk about
how many times that you dive the skyway a typical inspection of the skyway for a dive career would
probably take two months really absolutely absolutely and that's with like i say you don't get to pick
your weather or pick your visibility sometimes you you go down it may only be two or three feet
and a lot of its tactile it's not swimming across and just looking at stuff it's swimming across
finding the concrete piling really almost shimmy up and down each side and each face it's right in
your face it's more like a telephone line man when you're climbing up and down the piling and not
only that but you have to remove all the barnacle growth to see what's underneath so that that in
itself is a difficult task or enough so that you can see what you're inspecting and stuff and then
if you find more you can go ahead and bring in heavier equipment there were times out in the
early seventies when we first saw the cracking on the main piers on the north side we spent hundreds
of hours out there with pneumatic and with hydraulic equipment cleaning the large piers as big as this
room of to find cracks as small as eighth of an inch a quarter of an inch and then documenting them
so that we could bring it back to the engineer so they could take a peek at it once they saw
that we had some large cracks large up to a half an inch they would send us back out on those cracks
with a homemade jig with a hydraulic drill two inch core and we would set it up on that
concrete structure and take core samples at that crack location to see how far in if we could
that crack went and see what kind of material it was there was about I'm guessing about 12 or 14
piers on the north side and the south side of both old skyways and I think the we only found cracking
on the north side of the newer of the two bridges that in 76 so a few more broken are cracked but
we were doing you know we could spend a hundred hours just on one pier taking samples we put pieces
of glass on either side of the crack and epoxy it up there and that way if the pier did shift or move
that glass would more than likely fracture or crack if it got that bad that was our early strain
gauges they hired consultant companies to actually put strain gauges on the opposite sides of the
crack to see if there was any movement so there was a lot of testing going on before the bridge was
struck to see if they were going to make significant repairs to those piers and all the parts of the
bridge as well so you could spend hundreds of hours just on an assigned task out of the skyway
by the time that bridge was struck in may 9th I figure I had at least a documented
200 miles of underwater bridge inspection because back then there were we traveled the
entire state the seven mile bridge is not a seven mile inspection talking about the bridge and the
keys and the keys it's nine miles because it's not just swimming across and look at it everything
it swim to that pier swim around it if you can go to the next pier swim around it if you can
and keep going so that ends up to be about nine miles because skyway was about four four and a
half miles by the time you got done with that it was five almost six miles because you didn't
just swim from pier to pier you swam up and down you swam the bends and stuff so I know Mike when
he first started I think it was a new experience for him but for me I had been out there so I based
my comments on five years of you know full-time diving out there and stuff so you know that was
that was quite an experience back in the earlier days so the skyway wasn't scary for you to dive
I think I was more comfortable I just as comfortable as the skyway you had to be so
comfortable diving yeah that you didn't think about it diving was simply a mode of transportation
to get back and forth to our job yeah you had to put everything else out so that you could concentrate
on your inspections yeah and typically we had pretty good visibility visibility out there we were
we were very fortunate west coast of Florida other than the keys you know has some excellent
visibility on and off jacksville not so much not so much I mean you know we've got had good water
there were times out there when it was a lot of feel and stuff but on the day that the skyway
went down based on my time out there like we had a good 30 foot of visibility because Mike was
taking pictures of the entire roadway down there with this camera what's the deepest it gets under
the skyway under the like the main channel the main channel is probably 50 to 53 feet maybe 60
okay it varies egg monkey is a little bit deeper there's a hole out there of course okay so walk me
through the day that the bridge was struck by the ship what were you guys doing like that morning
how long have you had you guys been working together at that point can that can you walk me
through that day sure I'll start go ahead if I can fill it Mike was interviewed and hired on May
2nd which was a Friday called him up Friday afternoon and told him report to work on Monday
so technically he was hired on the 2nd came in to work Monday got his equipment and his gear
dive shop showed him around the office told him what our responsibilities were got him all geared up
went to the tackle shack and Pinellas Park and got us some equipment and stuff
so explain to him what we're responsibilities were spent some time diving at the skyway
with Mike prior to May 9th we did a couple of dives at within a within 200 yards of that
location where the bus fell into water we were inspecting the fender system what was what was
left of the fender system the fender system was a big issue it wasn't protected as it should have been
not my wheelhouse way before my time what what do you mean when you say fender system
by the time I started in 1974 the timber fender system that was built on that structure to protect
both of them had been demolished by ship traffic there was very little protection absolutely there
was no no protection to speak of for any large vessels as obvious as was obvious
uh so we spent a couple of days diving out at that location and a couple of days before that
so actually by May 9th he had only been with me two or three dives and actually five working days
and and Mike put it very very well when we were being interviewed uh by the times that's like
somebody now joining the New York fire department on September 6th and then walking up the stairs
on September 11th Mike had no idea neither did I that morning on Friday May 9th when we got to the yard
when we got to Pinellas maintenance yard DOT yard at the intersection almost to 49th and Olmerton
uh it was pretty miserable out it was rainy that was what the forecast was I had a
portable radio on my hip called the office told him we were going to step out
we hopped in the car at about seven o'clock in the morning after we met and we
knew we were going to have a long day because we were headed out to the skyway after the weather
cleared we stopped down to the restaurant local restaurant called the bunny hut
we were going to get some coffee and some some breakfast and stuff and at 7 34 give or take
the girls came out from the back and started talking about the skyway got knocked down
and they were pretty excited sounded pretty real uh that was it was kind of a bad joke
and and not a unusual one for the guys you know to always give us the business or me the business
about you know this bridge got hit and this one went down you got to do this and you got to do
that and stuff so it was kind of like teasing me so when they came out I you know my first thing was
okay they brought the radio out and uh I heard I think it was Al Ford the
sky and the guy in the sky and he was on the radio and he was talking about he said the
skyway had been hit and it's down and they were uh serious I remember they had TVs going too we
may have we could see we could see some live footage from from the restaurant of the of the
accident yeah so we hopped in the car went back to the yard the bosses are now
Ron Hasley if he was already on the radio we knew we were headed out there it was our duty our
responsibility to investigate any waterborne accidents that was our position description
that's what we did when we realized it was for real nobody needed to tell us to get out there
we knew we had to get out there so we scooted back to the yard it took us less than five minutes
we were out of there before eight o'clock with our gear because we were headed down that way
anyways and the boat we hopped on over 10 and at that time they were just on and off completing
the bypass to 275 from up around oberington and on down south to the skyway there were portions
of it were asphalt and portions of it were still dirt we had a 16 foot boston wailer
with the tank racks six tanks and threw all our gear in there and hooked it up to the back of the
station wagon and zipped as fast as we could down the partially built interstate zipping on and off
when we couldn't go around any further due to the construction i think we got off someplace around
fifth avenue north or something i think that's right i remember the high school i'm pretty sure we
probably ran the curb a couple of times and maybe even jumped the curb a couple of times
maybe even cut some corners a couple of times we got down there as fast as we could
we got down to 54th avenue south and the police barricade was up we identified ourselves and they
waved us through we ran down to our normal launch location which was skyway jacks
the marina o'neill's we got dressed we launched a boat there wasn't much traffic there at that
time it was just us we were still kind of early and started to head out from skyway jacks to the
bridge at our location once we got out of the mouth of the the small the small marina once we
got out of the small marina and got out there it was completely fogged up it was very very foggy
i had been out there numerous times numerous times and it had a difficult time navigating out
very thick fog yeah couldn't see the channel markers i mean from the reports like watching
the documentary they're talking about how it was like hurricane force winds and just downpouring
rain as well that was obviously way earlier yes that's absolutely correct absolutely correct
yep it was dead still when we got out there because the fog was thick it was a fog bank almost solid
it's a coincidence because it broke so that we could actually first time we saw the bridge
was where the current skyway memorial is okay where the very first time is where that memorial
is today was where we started to see that yeah right there also where the black thorn memorial
is you know it's almost like fate or something that that was there from that location we could
see the bridge i could see that the bridge was down i could see that the boat was still stuffed
underneath there uh we headed out there and the obvious location to start as far as i was
concerned was at the end of the bridge because that's more than likely where we would start an
inspection would be to go ahead and start measurements and stuff like that rather than just drive around
look for something to do so what we had it definitely we had a a plan started that location
and start documenting what we had we were on an accident investigation so that's what we were doing
but when you guys first got in the boat and put it in the water had you guys communicated with
anybody about what your mission was or what your objectives were no other than it's an accident
investigation and get out there as fast as you can on the way down listening to the am radio
we overheard that there was a bus that did go off and potentially 30 40 50 people were in the bus
you know we we did hear that we did hear that there was traffic that had driven off the bridge
so we knew that they were victim we knew that there were cars and vehicles and trucks and people
under water yes so what were you guys like talking to each other about like what were you like what
were you guys going to do once you got there i don't think we were doing much talking i think
there was more just trying to get down there and you know it's really hard to grasp the whole
enormity of the situation until we actually got there and could see what was happening i think
when we saw these students from eckard college in the water and their boats out there of course we
were already familiar with who they were and what they would normally be doing but when we could tell
that that they were over the site of the accident probably over the side of that bus and that they
had divers in the water at the same time working above the dangling steel superstructure that was
still in place above them that could potentially start dropping at any second and crash right down
on top of them i think we felt it was our duty to relieve them to move them away from danger and
assume that responsibility ourselves we're the state inspectors these these kids had no business i
don't think being out there doing what they were doing although and they were well meaning good
intentions but taking an unnecessary risk for uh for nothing i thought i i would i agree in large
part with mike i don't think the kids had any say in where they anchored up i'm pretty sure it was
the person who was responsible for you know for the rescue operation let me let me say this before i
go any further mike and i completely understand that if it wasn't for those kids in that equipment
being there that we would have never been able to accomplish what little
we could under those circumstances it would have been very nice to have a little more cooperation
from the man in charge but the kids were fantastic all of them
there was only one person that was being a ding dong and he was quickly ignored
we'd never asked them to leave that location we simply asked them to back off a little bit
so that we could take that responsibility like mike said my opinion was they were directly
in the flight path of anything coming off of that bridge anything we only went under there
after i picked up my radio and asked my supervisor who was up there ron who is a bridge inspector
if it was safe and if it was okay for us to go under there so we had communications with
topside people when we were out there and he did say yeah bob you got it
he later climbed down a ladder and entered our boat but like mike said i i'm not i'm so happy
as the kids were out there because mike and i had a 16 foot open whaler we had no place to put
any victims we were a two-man team we simply asked them to back off there was some unnecessary
conversation that happened uh mike eventually asked if we could tie off to the back of their boat
uh they let us they said what did the young fellow say go ahead or thanks yeah have at it have at it
and i'm pretty sure that that young fella's name is uh mike rosalett i think and i think he also
was mentioned in a book not too long ago uh and so that's uh kind of like where i got his name and
stuff but they were that the kids were fantastic kids what specifically were the kids doing the
kids when we first got there they were kind of scattered at the surface were they in the water
yeah they had no you know the skyway isn't a place to go to learn how to dive or to be
right for your first couple of dives i don't think they were prepared prepared for the
current in the velocity let alone the commotion in the water and the stuff going the other
activities the boats and people buzzing around several of them were bobbing and at the surface
drifting away from the boat i could tell that they were not going to be or be around
apparently a couple of the kids did enter the water and uh go around the boat uh the bus i'm sorry
and i was kind of disturbed i believe i read in the times or the evening independent that one
of the divers uh indicated that he went around to the back of the bus now remember as far as
i'm concerned when we first got there this is an accident investigation see okay state representatives
we identified ourselves they knew who we were that's what we were doing investigating that accident
i had read in the paper that one of those divers from the echo rescue team went to the back of
that bus and opened up the door and saw a mass of bodies and left them there or couldn't get them out
that's okay you know that's tough but didn't make an attempt to close the door
so that kind of like bothered me a little bit i mean i we appreciate the help and stuff but
they actually were disturbing the scene i didn't think that that needed to be done and i and i
wished that somebody would have told us back then that was that that had occurred i'd have gone back
down and closed that door do you think maybe they originally thought maybe they just had good intentions
absolutely i'm sure there could have been some potential survivors i'm sure they did and that's
why i say i'm not mad at the kids i just wish if we could have communicated and somebody would have
said i left the door open here maybe that you know i had to jump back in and close it was there any
possibility of any survivors when you got there did you when you guys got there what was the feeling
did you think there could be some survivors or do you think that it was just it was that was a tough
call at that specific time we really didn't know what we did notice was that the back of the bus
was still relatively afloat it was held up mostly by the dual wheels in the back early pictures of
that will show that the bus was at a severe i had a pretty good angle with the back wheels up
so there must have been some error in there
to the best of my knowledge and i haven't found anybody tell me anything different
i was the first and the only person to go in that bus
i had hoped beyond all hope that i would unfortunately i was not able to find anybody
that was alive or even looked like they had been i believe the coroner's report
on the 35 victims were 28 individuals perished from severe trauma impact and that seven people
had drowned which would have meant that they it survived the crash but for drown that was the
hillsborough county coroner's report i believe that was the final count so it was possible
unfortunately for us it didn't work out that way
so the bus was the back of the bus was kind of near the surface and then when you guys
got there you decided that you needed to get in the water
and get inside the bus and try to what was your plan
after we tied off after we asked them we asked them to please just get back in the boat
and help us recover the victims receive the victims and take care of them because like
say we had 16 foot boston well there was no way we could do that
we we suited up we rolled over we were in the water for less than 10 15 minutes
when we came up to the bus it was upside down it was facing south
uh i observed the bus driver uh my curt my curtis uh he was still behind the wheel he was inverted
i uh had my by my side he was with me
flipper stroke for flipper stroke the whole time side by side visibility was very good about 30
feet wow the front of the bus was anyways between 10 and 15 feet below the surface of the water
after the bubbles cleared we rolled in we could see the bus inverted i could see mr curt and
upside down i headed to the front of the bus i positioned mike i asked mike to stay outside
didn't think there would be any need for two of us plus i obviously
felt that was my responsibility as a senior man to take that responsibility which i did
i positioned mike outside the window near what would have been the entrance
the door door uh handed mr curtis to to mike uh went in a little bit further and recovered
another victim and passed him out for mike so mike was outside with two victims
i went back in a little bit further i i didn't realize how far uh i was going in the bus because
i wasn't concentrating on that i didn't realize until recently you know mike and i really
haven't talked about that until recently when mike told me that a couple of times that when i
went in the bus that he couldn't see me which to me meant that i went in a little bit further
and i thought in the documentary they mentioned that the roof had been like sheared off yes it had
yes it has the pictures are available on plenty of places that had been just about where the seats
were where the hard portion ends and the windows are was completely sheared there's nothing there
if it was upside down it would probably be less than less than four feet of crawl space it was a
mangled mess this is what i crawled into so were you actually in the aisle you were in in the aisle
but were you surrounded by bus structure or was there like nothing below you had we had the floor
chassis was over here yeah chassis in the walls and the seats going down okay and then below you
was what the steel structure of the bridge it landed on top of the bridge the truss yeah it
tumbled on top of the bridge i went in and grabbed two more victims uh just connected them from the
seat uh seat belts you under the seat belts no they didn't have any seat belts oh okay oh yeah
agree on uh i i want to i want to say this to all the uh family members and stuff is that
it was
very difficult to extract many of those people however i did the best i could
and treated them with as much respect as i could at the time
i set a soft prayer
for each one that i recovered and apologized for the treatment that i was giving them at the time
but i did feel it was necessary to get them out of there as fast as we can because i understood
that everybody needed closure and so did we we did everything we could to be as respectful as we
could when i came out with the second set of victims mike and i headed up to the surface
and handed them to the kids that were waiting on the back of the swim platforms of the boat
first victim was uh mike curtain and uh he was a good-sized man he was over six foot tall
i remember his engineer boots and his white shirt he was resting resting on the back of the swim
platform we've got a picture of him here yeah can you hold it up
a little bit a little bit like the same height as your head right there yeah perfect
my curtain right here this is this is mike
this is me these are some of the victims that we brought up
kids from echo college it's about eight or nine kids where was that photo taken from
i'm not real sure because i was busy at the time but i'm pretty sure it was taken from up top
yeah on the second bridge whatever was left of the bridge right that picture was a portion of a
i guess a film because it was featured in the documentary okay so it's there
this second documentary was colorized and i had never seen it before and i tell you when i saw it
recently struck home it was pretty hard so we we had arrived at the surface we transferred
we passed the bodies off the victims off they seemed to struggle a little bit but i think it was
because they they were overwhelmed i don't think they had any idea when they got up
and were rustled up there in the morning that they were prepared for that i don't think they
had ever seen anything very few of us were i had either mike either i had combat experience i had
dealt with that i had been through some of that stuff but even even then at that time
and it was only going to get worse i later realized you know that that we were just trying to get
everybody out and organize and get them out of there as fast as i can they they seem to have a
difficult time so we had an opportunity to get back into our boat as they were putting people
into the recovery boats uh got a call from our supervisor who wanted to come down so he climbed
down on the access ladder from 150 feet by himself and came to the northbound main span
and dropped the last two three feet two or three feet into the boat and the 16 foot open
whaler and uh he drove our boat back out to that location we re-anchored off the back of the
ericot college boat so now we had three people in the boat including our supervisor
they looked like they were getting a handle on the victims and and there was more room in the back
uh a couple of divers had popped up i think these were that might have been one of the volunteers
and then i think there's a saint pete fire department volunteer diver who came by i think he
helped also they uh had done some diving down at the at the bottom of the bay right we uh
but after the supervisor got in there we tied back off and uh we rolled back in
for a second trip into the bus station might got a front again and uh because i had removed
some of the people from near the front of the bus i obviously i had to go in a little bit
further the second time it was basically the same procedure i was able to only extricate
three people at this time with what i had uh i brought two of them out and gave them to mic
that's when for me things got a little more intense
on the way out i i felt that i had seen a small child bag overnight bag and
and felt like uh i needed to see what we could do to make sure that we tried to get that child out
things got crazy i was unable to see anybody before i bought that last victim out but i
do remember that and feeling that i had left somebody behind when we came out from the bus
we went up the second time when we handed the last of the victims off
to the echo college kids again they were having a little bit difficult time getting them in the
boat but they uh eventually got them all in except one which was the bus driver which they
appeared to lash to the back of the boat uh while we were down on that second dive apparently
the uh coast guard was notified and they had uh come out uh i think it was in the white sumac
uh to that scene also on that uh coast guard cutter i understand and i only understood this
recently was the governor uh the governor was in town that day and really yes on the coast guard
boat that's correct he was in tampa at that time and uh he was notified over a tamper at a meeting
and he jumped on i think it was the white sumac and went down there that was graham right yes
by graham yes and uh so he was on that site with the coast guard been so he may have heard some
of the reports i understood that uh we were not enthusiastically welcomed out there and that
there was a complaint that we were interfering with an operation so when the coast guard arrived
on scene with the governor uh the coast guardsmen uh notified our supervisor who was in the boat
that it was time for us to leave which is what we did well how much how much later did the coast
guard arrive uh we had recovered seven victims i'd say in about 20 25 30 minutes
they were probably into the vicinity already they just yeah they were on the way down from
tamper yeah they were on the way down from tamper the first divers according to the times
hit the water at 9 12 and that would have been the ecord college divers the some of the first
victims were were reported arriving at the hottest pier over at fort soto at like 10 o'clock 10 o'clock
that's like two or three hours after the boat hit the bridge yes yeah something like that so you know
some of the people had been in you know still there yeah so we did what we could uh they did
send somebody over we were asked to leave uh which we did and the sheriff's boat was out there as well
sheriff's boat was out there marine patrol boats were out there a lot of boats were out there
absolutely absolutely so we did as much as we could
and there's no doubt in my mind today that had we been left alone that we would have either
recovered everybody or died trying none no doubt in my mind then no doubt in my mind today what do
you think oh yeah we had plenty of air it was relatively shallow we could have gotten everyone
out but yeah we just we wish we would have been left alone but it was such a commotion and stuff
like you say everybody did the best they could the kids were fantastic and that's just speaking
about the bus you know there was a sort of other private vehicles in the water there was 35 people
total that died absolutely off the falling off that bridge right and how many people of them were
in how many of the 35 were in the bus um i'm thinking 20 i want to say 23 i want to say 23
off the top and where the rest of the bodies recovered from the other individual cars or
eventually yes the last victim was recovered on may 14th was recovered about three miles east of
the bridge that was the last victim found floating found floating yes several victims had washed up on
akemont uh fort soto park and stuff so they had recovered all the bodies by the 14th of may
good lord how do you got what do you guys do after that day like after that happened you guys go home
and how do you i mean it's not just business as usual after that i don't expect good but i
it was business as usual after that was it yeah we we were working the next day back out there the
next day at the same at the skyway oh yeah and for many days afterwards for me it was a little
bit different because for me after we were asked to leave i kind of needed to plan our next step
and find out what was required of us like you say it was still as far as i was concerned an active
accident investigation scene the national transportation safety board was called in from
washington they needed some information in regards to the location of the debris on the bottom how it
collapsed uh you know what it looked like etc when we left that scene that that that morning
we went back to the yard uh we brought our dive gear down to the tackle shack and that's where
we rented a camera yeah 16 millimeter movie camera 16 millimeter movie camera and we got
four 50 foot rolls of film yeah there was no video then no video back then four 50 foot rolls of film
how much did that cost we don't know actually i don't think lou charged us for that i i don't think
he had it you know it was his camera he gave it it was a personal camera you know and he understood
the gravity of the situation and he trusted us trusted mike the guy at tackle shack yes yeah
was andy there when you guys went there no no this is lou this is okay this is lou levine this is
andy's dad andy and jimmy and steve's dad okay so they uh we got our gear uh there he had all
the gear that we needed they took care of us it was difficult because he understood what was going
on because four five six months before that a short time before that the black thorn had gone down
in the channel and that was still partially obstructing the channel during the accident
as well it was still part of it in there and they had to relocate part of the channel to get around
that while they were removing it we talked about that black thorn we spent some time out there so he
was aware of that type of recovery that type of emotion and stuff he understood and called me
later on that night and talked to me and asked me if i was all right and if we were going to go
back and what we were going to do which obviously i knew we were going to after we had our equipment
we were in contact with the bosses over at the office the bridge office in tamper they told us
what they needed measurements as many photographs as we could get uh we were not uh much to my
displeasure but for whatever reason we were not invited to provide any information or help or
input on the recovery of the remaining victims but that that's okay we had a job to do they
had people to do that i feel like you took sort of like a lot more personal responsibility in this
than you were required yes and no if you read there's a book that was written about the skyway
and i think the governor when he was out there one of his comments and i only really realized it
recently was that at the time of that accident i think it was even at the time that he was there
on that scene his number one concern was nothing other than recovering as many victims
as quickly as possible so for me yeah maybe i took it personally and tried to do what i could
mike's a navy man you don't leave anybody in the water right i'm a marine right you don't leave
anybody behind yeah i feel like that's something that may have been the reason that you felt the way
felt that overwhelming sense of responsibility because i think most people just an average
everyday diver would have maybe not done what you guys did that that's probably true but you need
to understand that's what that was our job that bridge fed my family that bridge and all those
bridges provided leisure activities as well as work so yeah it was personal i i feel at times
that i need to defend that poor little thing that poor little bridge because it certainly didn't jump
out in front of that big boat but it was a nice little bridge and we enjoyed it so like say that
we probably did but i think people can understand why i take it personally i was responsible for
making sure that when people went across it it was safe right so yeah every bridge that people
go across i feel responsible for so i take some pride in that i didn't know mike does sure you
signed your name to that saying that it's okay now during that time after that right after that
happened a lot of people blamed the ship captain for that and i understand they're from watching the
documentary that there was a an ongoing public court trial going on where the government was
trying to prosecute the captain of the ship they were calling him an alcoholic they were calling
him incompetent everything under the you know calling him everything trying to blame him for
this because they were trying to find a quote unquote scapegoat for this what was your guy's
opinion of the whole situation following the crash following the uh i personally didn't
know very much about the pilot uh mr larrow i didn't really know john larrow larrow yeah i
didn't know anything about him so i really never dwelled too much on that he was eventually
completely exonerated right so it it wasn't an issue with me i didn't pay much attention to it
i on the other hand
when that occurred and i think that and i hope that people can understand my perspective when
people say the skyway accident is the accident and the victims and the faces of those victims
that i saw on that bus and that i still carry with me so i see it as personal i was there right up
close and personal can't get much more some people fault him i think because he he did have a rather
cavalier attitude prior to the accident and i think his quote was we're going to shoot for the
whole meaning he's going to try to go right down the center of that channel between the main peers
and hopefully he wasn't going to run into it he wasn't sure i don't think and 70 not wins
in torrential downpouring rain right that's right it it it's it's difficult to say i
i can guarantee everybody that he did not wake up in the morning and say boy you know what i'm
going to go out and smash him that ever as you kill somebody so it was a it was determined to
be an act of god right back when it happened on that day i probably would have said something
i've gotten into a confrontation had i ever bumped into him i felt that way for many many years i have
been offered numerous opportunities to sit down and talk to john leero bob height a local anchor
wanted me to speak to really asked me to go ahead and talk to him and see if i could and wanted to
for years i could not i could not accept the fact that he did what he did however i can say that i have
evolved it does come with age i do see things different i know that he was not an alcoholic
and he was not drunk when he struck that bridge i can guarantee everybody had he been drunk
and had alcohol in his system they would have detected it and he would have he would have
you know just been guilty i've seen a different side since i've been involved with reliving this
he had there was no way he could have done anything different because he was already
on such a trajectory through that channel with the wind and the weather all the elements that
were involved he couldn't stop the ship because the ship would have just sailed right into another
piling he had no choice but to try his best and thread the needle again there's even today there's
so much discussion on what he could have done what he should have done what he may have done
best thing would have been not to even go that morning and leave the the safety of the open
water where they had pumped the boat out right make it lighter however he did choose to had he had
a current updated accurate weather forecast from ruskin notifying him that there was a potential
weather bomb headed in his direction with cyclonic winds shortly i'm pretty sure that he would not
have even left to go into the bay however he did that decision was made he did the best he could
it was considered an act of god had he not taken the actions that he did by throwing it into reverse
dropping the anchors there's no doubt in my mind had he completely ignored all of that and kept on
plowing through that he would have more than likely taken down the second bridge probably he
probably would have taken down both bridges if he didn't take the actions that he did right i think
he did a fantastic job based on what he had to work with and isn't it true that the weather
report didn't even come in till like an hour after he struck the bridge absolutely or or so
absolutely that's why i say if he would have had proper communications like they do today
i'm sure it wouldn't happen the radar was a complete whiteout or blackout or whiteout there
was there was no other vessels that could give him any advice on the conditions ahead the other
vessel that was headed out they had a full load of oil was called the pure oil was headed out at
the same time at about 7 30 in the morning he saw the weather he didn't get a forecast he diverted
his ship out of the shipping channel and actually anchored up and waited for the storm to pass
really yes it was called the pure oil it's it's pretty well documented in the newspaper and
they were leaving the docks going out to sea he was headed out with a full load of oil i
shudder to think what would have happened had he not pulled out and anchored up i think he stopped
i want to say less than a half a mile or a mile from the bridge on the east side on the inside had
he not stopped and done what he did he either would have been under it in it on top of it or whatever
with a load of oil and i can only imagine the potential impact environmental impact damage
from that so like i said there there were plenty of stories out there and plenty of
conditions that you know people make choices everybody made a choice on that day and that
was the choice and that was the results there i guarantee you that you know there's no way he
intentionally did that or or that he was drunk that's that's still disgusting to this day to hear
yeah you're it's a good point you made it could have been way worse if he would have done something
different now put it in reverse not through the anchors down he could definitely hit that second
spanning kill way more people and taking both bridges out and completely shut down the economy
and and everything for south absolutely so how long how many times after that day did you guys
go out consecutively to try to i'm going to guess we were out there for about two weeks
i know we were out here the next day on the 10th we started measurements we started
photography we swam every inch of that thing as it was down on may 11th which was mother's day
is when they brought that bus up finally we were out there on mother's day we were within a couple
of hundred yards of that location it was very difficult there was a lot of for whatever reason
boat traffic and you got to call them what it is gawkers yeah that just wouldn't stay away that
coast guard and the marine patrol had a very difficult time people keeping people away from
the location as they were trying to raise the bus they had brought in a derrick and a floating barge
and they lifted eventually the bus up onto that location on mother's day mother's day on that evening
at that time i was married and i had two children and i can guarantee you that when i went home on
mother's day my wife got an extra big hug and a kiss not only that day but the every day for about
two weeks afterwards when i went out there i know that mike's fiance at the time
mike's fiance at the time probably would have skinned me alive if she could have caught me
realizing what i had put mike through and what i had put mike done in that day and the following
day and the next day i know it was difficult for mike and i know it still is for both of us
we were out there a good two weeks gathering information not only for the dot but also for
like i said earlier the national transportation safety port we had completed a report and put
it together it was published i think june of 1980 when did you guys get this thing
uh and how much is this way i'm guessing it's i i waited i'm guessing it's 38 pounds
that more than that this thing is like could be that is one of four large anchor bolts that anchored
the bearing pad to the top of pier one south there were four of those that were holding a
pad probably about the size of this table a concrete pad on top of the concrete
yeah that essentially is the means of securing the trust to the concrete piers that's a big
ass nut here it is right this is yeah i'm gonna show you this but i've got a better picture
this is the pier
pier one north there's a small speck on top of that you may not be able to see it
but that's the remaining bearing pad the other bearing pad was on this side
when the bridge was pulled off in this direction it pulled itself completely free
of the bearing pad by snapping four of these large bolts in a nanosecond
it sheared it's just like a superman ripped that four of those and this is what that was one
that's the that's the remaining bolt was four feet into the embedded four feet into the concrete
jesus christ the noise that that bridge would have made when that thing went down because all of
that metal snapped and buckled and rivets were flying hundreds yards away and steel was flying
and that thing squealed and cried the whole way down so that was one of four that was completely
sheared we recovered all four of those and on that particular day i think we swam up of course we
were both younger than but how could you swim up 50 feet with one of these in your hand bob could i had
to tie the one i had to walk and pull it up with a rope that's what we did for a weird commercial
diary that's what we did i was a good swimmer so you must have been jacked we uh we were able
to recover four of those and this is one eventually i'm thinking about donating it maybe to the
museum over in tampa there's a skyway museum well well i really think about that my kids
my grandkids may want that but this is one of four that was snapped that's unbelievable instantly
that's why i say the the the tremendous energy that it must have taken and the noise that it made
when that thing popped it would let go must have been tremendous tremendous oh yeah not to mention
all the small rivers yep yep absolutely how long did it take for them to start rebuilding in the
new bridge well you're that's how long did it take them to start rebuilding the new bridge
they didn't rebuild the new bridge they they they built a new structure that was open in 87
so it took seven years yeah it took seven years for the construction and that was after the
completion of what type of design and who is going to build it and what type etc etc uh they were
able to use the northbound bridge to uh to you to oh yeah there was still half of the bridge
correct so they just split up they barricaded it off and and signed it up and stuff and they
carry traffic for until 1987 when it was finally uh blown up and destroyed wow and of course the
fishing piers are still there the the remains of the original bridges now the seven years seven years
later when they started to construct the new bridge were you guys involved in any of the
inspections of that bob weren't you telling me you were showing me a photo you were telling me they
wanted you to dive down inside of like a tube where they were pouring concrete underwater
yes you need a cofferdam yes let me uh what's it called cofferdam cofferdam a cofferdam yeah
essentially they take steel sheet piling that are interlockable and they pound them into the
ground form a complete circle and they can pump that out and it have a have a dry area okay right
in the middle of the bay so they can start drilling their foundation supports oh wow yeah
how do you want to do this just hold it up you can hold it on the chair if you want all right well
there's the cofferdam okay this is one of the bearing piling that they used
caisson that they drilled into the ground anywhere from 80 to 100 feet uh it's about
eight feet in diameter because there's a human being right there about eight feet in diameter
i think there was about 44 of those scattered around the the perimeter that's nuts of the main
piers of the two main piers that that's the one that they wanted us to go inside and check to see
if it was okay and didn't collapse that's insane man that's wild well what made this even more
challenging is that these are just uh unprotected steel okay and so they they get rust oxidation
on them even below the water and so if you go into one of these and create any turbulence at all
that oxidation on the sides comes off the sides and immediately clouds the water
so you have zero visibility can't see a thing can't see your hand this far from me right
how deep do those things go i'm they what they did was they had determined how deep they needed
to go each one may have varied but you can let's just wait till you get back to the microphone so
we can hear you
they were used as bearing pile of supports at tremendous weight so they had determined the
pre-determined elevation they were averaging like usually 80 to 100 and some feet before
they were satisfied that they would hold the bearing i'm not sure because there were 44 of them
and they were a neat pier or something there was a bunch so they had varying elevations
yeah man it's amazing to me that there was a time when they wouldn't think of having something
to protect bridges from these massive tanker or these massive cargo ships that were going through
just like these giant objects that could easily destroy this bridge that people drive over every
day like like you see now obviously those big round whatever they are this big round concrete
bumpers they have they call them dolphins that's correct they're called dolphins dolphin track
correct it's amazing to me that they weren't they no one could think of that before this had to
happen unfortunately that's part of the the history of the inspection program like i say it started
with a tragedy in the anklet river and they developed a program this tragedy changed the way
they looked at building and protecting bridges just like you said after this occurred they had
determined that it was inadequately protected so they made special efforts to put in those large
dolphins which you know will sustain most any impact that's what they were designed for it
affected bridges being built everywhere not just in the united states but all across the country
they used that as an example for protection and stuff so it did cause tragedy did cause a lot
of advances in bridge inspections bridge building and bridge construction materials now this was
also the biggest bridge disaster or a bridge accident in history this was the largest bridge
ship collage accident in history in us history that's correct and this i mean the bridge the
skyway bridge is like a monument and an icon to florida like even you'll see on you go to any gas
station and any florida postcard has a big picture of the sun and then a big outline of the skyway
bridge i mean it's like a monument for florida yeah considered an icon i think it's considered one
of the top 10 bridges in the united states for aesthetics and stuff it's very nice they just put
a million ten you see it at night when it's all lit up it's all lit up now i've never been i mean
i've driven over but i've never like been in a boat under it when it's at night yeah they spent
millions of dollars on led lighting that shifts make different colors patterns american flag
very beautiful they've done that to many of the bridges many of the bridges that bridge accident
also caused like i say special safety features now and all of the larger bridges electronic
monitoring sensors to tell if there's any vibrations or separations in the spans to prevent
that kind of stuff they've done tremendous amount of improvements in regards to safety on large
structures like that to you know prevent something like that from happening that's incredible and what
was so explain to me what the process was when these people for this documentary the skyway bridge
disaster when they came to you were you surprised or shocked at all within any of the information
that they were able to uncover i'm going to say that we came to them my daughter had no one knew
about you guys nobody had ever heard about the dlt divers except our bridge inspection community
our family the skyway documentary did not know no disrespect frankie hear about us before that
i contacted contacted them and we had our first meeting on june 26 of 2019
the documentary came out in september of 2019 so i had just bumped into him they had put a
facebook site up and they were asking for true stories i knew we had a true story and i knew
that it was a story that had never been told because we didn't tell it nobody asked nobody asked
nobody asked so we pestered them i pestered them and pestered them and they finally said
if these guys are for real i imagine we probably ought to interview them so they contacted us we
had a meeting over at derby lane we met with frankie van der beel and introduced ourselves
and i and i think it was pretty pretty plain from frankie that i provided the documentation that i
have and our expertise and experience and bridge inspection and our story but i think pretty much
when i put this picture down and later in front of them i think he understood that we were actually
out there all of the most of the people in the documentary and stuff uh there's not too many
of them that were actually there there are a few there's a couple of coast guardsmen
and some of the other people but most of the story i think we were some of the few people that were
really there we hadn't had a chance to tell our story and once frankie heard it he made sure that
we were there i have a special announcement if you'll allow me yes please i am proud to announce
that the documentary film crew has considered and are putting together a part two of the skyway
documentary oh cool they have received reviews on the amazon site they asked for reviews and
they are listening to the people that reviewed the documentary uh they have taken their people's
questions and are looking to tell more stories and are actually putting together a part two
to be out soon as they can complicate complete the the issue but they are going to go ahead and do a
part two on that include more stories such as ours so hopefully it'll be out here shortly but i you
know that's uh that's an exclusive for you interesting man well what else would it cover
besides i mean obviously this documentary i feel like it covered a lot of the story of um
lyro the captain and his attorney and their friendship and kind of like the misconceptions
of him so the second part you think we'll dive more into the story the personal stories what they
done is they've taken review based on the reviews that they got and they're going ahead and trying
to answer some of those questions of who the people want to see that have seen the the documentary
what they want to hear so they're asking more people probably somebody like uh the coast guard
people and us maybe would be included in telling further stories they're looking for stories rather
than you know just the the the accident itself that's incredible well i look forward to it is
there anything else that you guys like to share before we wrap it up yeah i i'd like to say thanks
to a lot of people there there's so many people that were out there that day that we worked with
in in past uh that while we were still out there we worked with the penance county sheriff's
department their bomb squad when we were doing bomb inspections out there also we work with the
manatee county sheriff's bomb squad hillsborough county sheriff's bomb squad we work with the dive
teams we would like to say thank you to all of those guys that we didn't have a chance to you
out there that day or the following months and years that thing had received several bomb
calls and bomb threats that we were involved in another one of those things that you know
it wasn't in our job description but we did it it was necessary to open it up for traffic
we haven't had a chance to say thank you uh i have a poster similar to the one over there
that was signed by as many people that we could muster that were there that day from panellas
maintenance that we'd like to go ahead and give to the dot yard and say thank you to all of those
guys who also haven't had a chance to tell their story and and give them that opportunity to at
least be acknowledged and recognized so we we do have some further plans to give some posters
out and say thanks uh there are so many people that were involved without my faith my family
my friends and the truth there's no doubt in my mind that it would have been so much
more difficult to accomplish what we did prior to us being exposed or coming out
in the documentary nobody had heard our story we're not looking for a parade money or badge
or anything like that we're just trying to set history straight tell the truth if it's going
to be about the skyway and we were involved i'd like the truth to be told and so far i think
the documentary has done a very good job definitely have to give a shout out to gabrielle
police and and the times for allowing her the opportunity to spend some time doing an investigative
report that further solidified and documented our credibility in regards to this issue gabrielle
did a great job great job and she and she really kept us all out of trouble and kept it as neutral
as she could she did a fantastic job and thanks to the times even though it took 38 40 years
to get to us we appreciate the time that we've had well thank you guys for sharing your story
i'm sure it it takes a lot to be able to talk about everything in detail and you know i appreciate
you guys for all the hard work and sacrifice that you guys have made as well and uh thanks
again for coming on and telling your story danie i appreciate it thank you very much yes sir pleasure
