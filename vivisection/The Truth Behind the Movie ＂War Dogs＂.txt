Like Coleman has two penitentiaries then you have mediums the bulk of the system
I think is basically mediums because that's basically what you think of is
like a real prison yeah and then you have Lowe's and then you have camps camps
have no fences typically there's a few that have fences but even those fences
you can jump them basically you'll have like 200 people there 150 guys you'll
have like two guards and they sit in a room because you're basically on out
custody is that where you can do work-release programs right you could
write that sort of thing okay so there's just you know can the camps and the
camps are just outrageous I mean guys are like jumping the fence going and
getting McDonald's coming back guys are jumping the fence going and robbing
7-elevens and coming back I mean there was an Atlanta these guys are like they're
they're all drunk all the time they're you know it's insane they all have
cell phones they're all taking pills and it's outrageous but they were saying
look you know you'll I always assumed that 10 years I could have gone to a
camp because I came in with camp points so I was thinking to myself I'll go to a
camp and I'll leave so basically by the time I kind of started putting that
together you know I've been locked up I had like 10 years to go in my mind I was
like you got 10 years you really had like 20 something years to go but I was
just thought man I'll just go to a camp and leave because I mean that's just
you're trying to say anything to get yourself through it yeah exactly you
know it's that whole hope so little light at the end of the tunnel right
anyway I go to low I'm there and I decide I'm gonna write a memoir so I
end up writing a memoir and while I wrote that memoir I read a bunch of
books on a bunch I really like two books on how to write memoirs I wrote a
book on I read like a like nonfiction writing for dummies or something which
is actually a great book so I read these books and what's funny is that you
know you really have to kind of learn about yourself you know does that make
sense like you I got locked up and initially when I got locked up it was
everybody else's fault and you start reading about yourself and about
memoirs and about how to what helped shape you who you were how did you get
here you know you have to do some internal you know thinking about yourself
and you start to realize you know I realized kind of like you know I put
me here nobody else did I made all those decisions I'm just a douchebag right
I fucked up I've made some selfish decision I'm extremely narcissistic I'm
extremely self-centered yeah I tend to dominate conversations it's difficult for
me to take interest in other people I mean I have some major fucking problems
you know I'm extremely entertaining well it's I mean it's huge to be able to
recognize that I mean that's a huge that's a huge I mean but what's yeah
but I'm saying that's what's funny is I'm in prison reading this and I'm like
and you're realizing all of it yeah I'm going that's me where I would have never
said that before had someone actually accused me of being a narcissist or
arrogant or anything I'd be like that's bullshit you don't know me you don't
know you know what you do know me because you start to see yourself and
as you really are and so it you know it's it's it's humbling you know to
realize that yeah and then start to see it in other people you know and see
yourself in other people so you know anyway I end up writing a memoir while
I'm writing that memoir guy named f from Deverelli is comes on the compound
Deverelli is Deverelli was in Rolling Stone magazine Deverelli had he and
another guy named Packhouse had sold military weapons and ammunition to the
US government and he'd ended up selling a bunch of Chinese ammunition which was
embargoed and he got in trouble Rolling Stone did a big spread on him by a guy
named Guy Lawson so I mean I read the article and somebody told me hey you
know that article the other day in Rolling Stone about the gun kid and I
was like yeah they go that's him right there I was like fuck so later on I went
up to him and talked to him and said hey man my name's Matt Cox you know you
ought to think about right I read your that article on you you ought to think
about writing a memoir and he was like oh I couldn't write a memoir I'm like
ADHD and I'm bipolar he said I couldn't pay attention I couldn't do that I mean
it was real dismissive I said well if you need any help I'd be willing to
willing to write an outline for you or work with you on an outline you could
probably send it to a ghostwriter on the street and they could ghostwrite it for
you you still have plenty of money obviously and he's like yeah I'll think
about it so anyway a few like months go by and visually after several months I
basically was finishing up mine I ended up getting a literary agent and so I
convinced so Deverelli comes to me and he says hey you know I definitely I want
to do it that sort of thing so we end up doing this right I ended up writing this
book for him and so then he ends up I'm not gonna get all into it it's too
convoluted it's a whole another story it's a whole another story he ends up
leaving with the memoir gives me a big bear hug tells me I know him more than
anybody in the world you completed for him of course right well I wrote the
whole thing right and I want to take you to write it about three months okay
which is quit really really quick but God he had a ton of he had all of his
evidence and his sister was doing all research for me so if I was like hey
listen he told me about this where I'm sorry I'd send her an email say he told
me about one time this happened at this do you remember when this playing blew
up and can you look up some articles bam she'd send me all these articles yeah
was that again his sister his sister was doing research for me and he had like
just put you in contact with all these people that he worked with and his
family and he had like ten or he had like ten or ten different boxes of evidence
oh wow under his bed and the lockers and everything so if I said hey in there
with him yeah wow well he's fighting his case okay so you know if I said hey do
you have your transcripts from that of course I'll bring him to you tomorrow
he'd show up with stacks of transcripts I had to read and pull out stuff and so I
end up writing this book he leaves with the book Warner Brothers according to
his his lawsuit Warner Brothers ends up getting ahold of the manuscript okay and
they use his manuscript and this guy G lost in the article that that in Rolling
Stone magazine they'd bought the rights to the article and they use the article
plus hit the book that I wrote the manuscript to supposedly write the
movie War Dogs directed by Todd Phillips right and with Jonah Hill plays
Deverelli right and it's funny because you know anyway you know he's a
scoundrel he plays a scoundrel he really never I mean you know Jonah Hill did a
great job so that that movie gets made and then is it really is it pretty
accurate it's it's accurate only I think that I think Deverelli is is more
cunning more vicious okay you know so how on point is the movie to like the
manuscript you wrote did they go did they veer off they definitely veered
off okay what they did was they they took scenes that were definitely scenes
from my manuscript but they swapped characters like they changed them they
altered them certain ways things that were certainly not in any of the other
books they're definitely taken from my manuscript but then instead of having
Deverelli like in the movie Paco's girlfriend is against the war and
there's all these arguments between Paco's and his girlfriend about the war
she doesn't like the war she didn't like him selling weapons the so she's
against it in real life that was Deverelli they just swapped the characters
oh so Paco's didn't have this great apartment it was that was Deverelli
there's all these things that Deverelli so they just swapped them because they
couldn't because they had Paco's life rights not Deverelli's so they just
swapped the two wow but anyway so so what were you doing when you found out
this movie came out oh I'm I'm in the I'm still in prison Deverelli stopped
talking to me my literary agent stopped talking to me so the two of them are now
suing war we're then suing Warner Brothers who Deverelli and my literary
agent they end up teaming up and suing Warner Brothers and nobody's talking to
me nobody's telling me anything I've never gotten that they're not sending me
money they're not answering calls I'm writing letters I mean that like I said
that's a whole nother story the point is is they I I sue them they sue me they
sue Warner Warner they end up that there's all these things I don't I've
signed a confidentiality agreements I don't want to say what what actually I
know happened but the bottom line is this story on your website part of the
memoirs not on your website no okay no no no actually the memoir is on the
web so I think you can buy the memoir if you click if you go there part of the
story is yes the story about me meeting him and writing the book okay and then
him getting out and him filing suit against Warner Brothers and the whole
that that part is there but then it kind of it I think I end it with me filing a
lawsuit and then I don't say anything else because since then things have
happened we've had mediations we've had several things so it's that's currently
going on right now so and I told you but where's some of the stuff that's
happened where's Devaroli right now he's in Miami I saw him I saw him a month or
so ago about a month ago I went down for the deposition and that's a whole
that's a whole nother story man that's it's insane so I matter of fact my
lawyer might actually be like what the hell do and don't talk about that so
but I don't think I've said anything this is not already in public record but
there's other stuff anyway so we're still sorry we're still going back and
forth anyway so I write his one you know I'm writing now so now I've decided I
want to write I remember Devaroli had read my manuscript my my memoir and he
said it was a he wanted me to write the story he is that's the best thing I've
ever best thing I've ever read but in retrospect after later I found out he
actually only read like Dr. Seuss yeah he never really read anything so I was
okay well it's not really a compliment you've read like three books your whole life
