I wanted to see how brainwashed people were because in this day and age, I couldn't believe
that people can really be that brainwashed.
So I set up a conversation with her.
So I was like, yeah, I know you guys like me a lot, but why do you guys hate Westerners?
She said, well, we don't hate Westerners.
We just don't want Western, we don't want the Western influence in our country.
And I said, okay, what about basketball?
She said, basketball was created in North Korea by a great leader.
Now mind you, what I'm doing now is actually very dangerous.
It's extremely dangerous.
Do you know that you're a great leader studied outside of North Korea?
Now I don't know what the hell I was thinking of when I was saying this, but this could
get you arrested.
Is that true?
Yeah.
Oh, I didn't even know that.
Switzerland, yeah.
And she says, that's not true.
I said, yeah, it's true.
I said, everyone knows it, the whole world knows it.
