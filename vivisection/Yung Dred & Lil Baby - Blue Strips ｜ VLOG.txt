Life's down and it's a catapult
Sensitive to the onslaught of all
I know the points on a muddy mission
In these streets I go to television
They ain't think I'm making this far
Remember days me and Tish talk
69-12 gave my man hell
Posted on the curb trying to catch the set
Me and you can't relate
But me and you not the same
I took a auto
I put it all on the line
I threw the lamps in the train
In a week that he came
They ain't see who I think I am
First of all I'm the man
WG on the slippers
Balmain with the zippers
Never get tired of ballin'
Throwin' my niggas to y'all land
Make your money while she callin'
I choose the money off the beach
It's the first look she got and she gon' want you with it
