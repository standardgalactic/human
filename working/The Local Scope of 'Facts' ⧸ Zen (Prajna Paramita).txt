Hello, everybody. Welcome. It's so far mostly gray and blustery day here, where I am, when I am.
You know, I have a couple of sort of bookmarks today. I actually don't like the use of this
filler word, sort of. It's a, what would I call it?
It's, it's, I'm stuttering, that's great. It's a form of stuttering, and I don't want
to, you know, I've often found, I think this is really important. I've been close with
a few people who either stutter or have stuttered, and I recently came to know a young woman
who had suffered a significant series of brain injuries, primarily as a result of relational
violence, being subjected to beatings by a man with whom she was involved. And I feel
safe talking about this because there are millions of women around the world like this.
But my experience with her was extremely peculiar. I'm just going to state my two bookmarks
because I'll lose them if I don't. The locality of facts and what is in. So in talking with
this young woman, she was prone to produce incomplete statements in language. And what
I was referring to was the fact that she was a young woman, and she was a young woman,
and she was a young woman, and she was a young woman, and she was a young woman, and she was a young woman. And what I was
very surprised, my rational mind was extremely surprised by my experience of her communication.
My heart was not. So this was my experience. As she produced incomplete, stuttery statements,
her vocal music...
...spun up something in me, not like mind sight, in that I could predict what she was
trying to say, although I could, but something much weirder, heart sight, in which I could
receive and understand in a very deep and compelling way what was in her heart, as if
my heart were completely shut.
My heart was چhã?
My heart wasn't aware of the intньes, ancestral wrote words that I had uttered to my mother.
And the way that she endangered her voice to be in my heart cannot be called true.
So while it was
Do you bellybutton
wor�더
when deine
Yes, ma'am
is
and correct me if this is got hello
to Your
heart
Yes, I am
not
loose
That is
I'm
asking you
to
make
a
do
your
capacity
th e
And it wasn't merely that my heart understood them.
Something much stranger was going on.
And I have this experience often, particularly with people who are stuck in some kind of suffering
that is historically structured for them, right?
For example, like this script that keeps replaying in relationships either with authority or lovers or parents or children.
I can see quickly, especially if I care, the more that I care for the person, the more profound the experience is.
I can see a metaphysician.
Sorry, there's a lot of wind right now.
Over the situation.
And that, for me, is like an insight engine.
Except it's not an engine, it's like a star of insight.
And so what happens is that, you know, I sometimes, I rarely give myself labels,
but for the sake of, you know, making something somewhat clear, I'll do so here.
So, always think...
Throughout my life, but much more dramatically in the post-toymaker phases of my life.
The phases after the contact with the non-human intelligence that I refer to with this pet name.
I'm clairsentient with humans.
It's almost as if...
I don't know how to describe it.
Yeah, I do.
I can find a way to describe it.
I don't know what I can find.
I can seek.
So,
it is as if
the secret interiority of others,
like a star shining light on my heart,
which my intellect becomes then the servant of,
so I can articulate back to them.
Inappropriate situations of this type.
It's like I'm being driven
by their interiority,
to see.
Not see as in visualize.
See as in feel.
And then...
formulate...
a map.
It's not really a map, though.
It's very intimate, this experience.
And so, with this young woman,
as she would stutter and produce incomplete statements,
I would say back to her,
what I felt
those communications
were trying to say,
but not say in words,
say in emotions and relationships
and unspoken
understandings.
Now, obviously,
when this is going on for me,
part of me disappears.
Part of me disappears.
Part of me disappears.
Part of me disappears.
Part of me disappears.
Part of me disappears.
Part of me disappears.
I'm not...
I'm no longer just Darren,
and I'm pretty sure this is what goes on with
authentic psychics, telepaths,
mindsight folks,
remote viewers,
shamans,
actual shamans,
people who practice
getting out of their own way
in various ways.
You reduce the investment
in the local Darren,
and you get
a much different
way of being
in the world and in relation
in return.
It's not like I sacrifice myself.
I don't
go nail myself to some cross
and then wait for the visions.
It's more like
my love and concern for the
person I'm with
removes
egoic investments
in Darren.
And
this results
in insight.
Now,
there's an entire branch
of psychology that studies
just
the
not just
incomplete statements,
but the ways in which
we pause,
the ways in which we interrupt ourselves,
incomplete statements,
partial statements,
vocal noises that don't
become words,
how someone starts to say
two words
together as one, but then pauses
and actually gets one of the words out.
It might sometimes be the word
they didn't mean.
And all of this kind of thing.
And this is
extremely important.
The reason this is important
is because
the actual languages of our interiority
are naturally
incomplete. This is what's
happening with identity when we're dreaming.
The natural
incompleteness
of the dreaming
mind's way of being
in relation
is
very profound
and it
resists explicit structure.
In our modern world
we are trained to favor explicit
structure. This is
like a bird being trained to favor
one of the toes on its
foot to the
degree that it doesn't have
wings, even though it has wings.
Except with us,
because we're talking about our minds,
you have
like 7,000 kinds of
wings that you can form
that fly
above explicit structure
and we are trained
to snip these off.
Many of them we are trained to snip
off and just exclude
based on what is called
rational thinking or
common sense
right?
But it is neither rational nor
commonsensical.
It's simply an array
of pervasive fictions that we are
instructed with and
which are
re-impressed on us
moment to moment
as we interact with
the fake
representational
the fake aspects of the
representational layer
in the network of human minds locally and
distributively.
Yeah, so
I want to give an analogy here.
Most of what we think of as knowledge
is
knowledge of the kind that
is very
compelling because it's hyper-collapsed
and
it's not actually knowledge at all.
Real knowledge is
intimacy. It's like what I was having with
a young woman.
Emotional
and articulatory
intimacy. So I was able to articulate
for her
in a way that she celebrated and
freaked out about
what she was
attempting to communicate
to me
with her stuttery, incomplete
statements. And in
that case, I'll come back to the analogy in a moment,
but in that case
it was the very incompleteness
and the interruptive
rhythms
and vocal music and so forth
that
essentially forced me
it caused me
to see.
So I became
like a receiver
that was willing
to be effectively
Oh boy, I'm going to get
into trouble here.
So rather than use gender stereotypes
we could talk about yin
and yang.
So I was willing to be yin
or
receptive
to the yang of her
heart.
And by being subjective
and connected to that yang
energy, that structuring energy
and by being released
from my own structuring
habits and proclivities
not completely but somewhat
the spirit of insight
arose
in me.
So she would transmit
content into me
and then
I would have this
slightly dreamlike experience
where my awareness
became the servant of her
heart's purpose.
And then I would speak back
to her from there
about what she was sharing
very incompletely in language
and she would be astonished
and giddy
because there's nobody
she has no experience of this
in her common life. Now, children
do this all the time.
Many children are like this.
We train it out of them.
I saw an example of this
yesterday which I'll skip over
but I was involved in an example
of this.
So
you know
this is not thinking.
It's not thinking.
Whatever it is I'm up to
that produces
these
miracles in a way.
It's not thinking.
What happens though is that
thinking is involved.
So instead of the hand
of my thinking directing my
body,
the body of my soul and my heart
is directing the fingertips of my thinking.
You see?
And this is really how we are supposed
not supposed to be. This is what we are
meant for. We are born for this
the way fish are born for water,
birds are born for the sky
and so forth.
So
the analogy that I wanted
to give is
that the aspect
of our potentials
for intelligence that is fully captured
modern humans
well fully is a little bit wrong.
There's some space that's uncaptured
always.
But that is commonly captured
us and leads to ideas of common
sense and so forth.
By the way that
common sense thing, it's not common.
First of all
it refers to
essentially not doing
dumb things because you
have a little bit
of an overview of the situation
so that you're not
so focused on details that you lose
the plot.
Um
So common sense is not
common in that
there's a, it's a topology
right? There's some common sensical
things. But really common sense is
local sense.
Um
And we hypothetically
transfer this into a
universal which is
makes us stupid.
Because common sense is local to the
people involved in the situation.
And it's not hypothetical.
Um
When it's real.
So I just like to
put this little, you know
marker here
that
The beings involved in an actual
situation have information that beings
hypothesizing about it
uh they have intimacy
right? The beings hypothesizing about a
situation will never have. Ever.
Um
Hypothetical thinking
is useful
but it's as deadly to intelligence
as it is useful to pragmatism.
So the analogy I want to give about
the stuff that we call thinking and also
common sense
is imagine that somebody walks into a bookstore
and
or a library
and in this library
um many of the books
if not most of them
have those slipcovers
on which something is printed
you know usually the
title of the book and the author
and some pictures or something
right?
And um
In this analogy
a person walking
into the library sees some
slipcovers
and they say to
themselves
this is extremely true
um
hmm
wow
Sorry I'm at the water
and
it's very profound
the way the water teaches us
about the nature of everything
is just by
what it does
what it is
hmm
it's breathing
it's alive
it's more than merely alive
um
so somebody walks into a bookstore
and they see
ah these books have slipcovers
and they determine after some tests
you know perceptually
and comparing
um
they determine that
the covers of the books
are made of paper
hmm
and then with some
further examination
they determine
that most of the
bindings of the books
are made of something
like paper
and then with some
further examination
they determine
that most of the
bindings of the books
are made of something like paper
and that the interiority of the books
is made of paper
and having derived
this universalization
over the library
they don't need to read any books
right
because they know
with a capital K
what the truth of the books is
the truth
of the books
is that it's just a bunch of paper
and this is a wonderful analogy
of the very pragmatic
but also completely
debilitating
and blinding
and crippling
aspect
of our thinking minds
I want to be very clear
your mind is not
for that
right
your mind is not
for single value derivations
over a nanometer
fold of continua
that are expressed in your experience
in various ways
reducing them to
single valued what's
is the death
of insight and intelligence
just crucifying that stuff
and then
celebrating the results
and you see this all over the place
in distributed human societies
it's basically what corporations and nations are
they are the enactment
of this
primarily for the sake of money
which is also
a result of doing this
right
it reduces all situations
and relationships to a single valued
object
which is
universally authorized
and pervades
over
thus extinguishing
intimacies and relationships
and so forth
the origins of intelligence
disappear on a world where money
is a
primary
feature
of
hmm
relation
it replaces relationships with transactions
right
and advertising is a way of pretending
there's still a relationship there
when there isn't
or should be or might be
though advertising
is a complex demon
it's very difficult to avoid doing
what I'm talking about while talking about it
but I'll have a go at it
anyway
so
that's not thinking
and
you know
we see some phenomena
we hear about some situation
and
many of us
are inclined to think
oh that's a this
that's an example of this
and then
believing that we
have understood the phenomena
we then ignore the rest of it
and go on to eating Cheetos
and playing video games
whatever the thing we're doing is
I'm going to leave out some of the more deleterious
things we do
for the moment
now I am also
prone to this and single value thinking
is very useful in an extremely limited
scope
if I want to have a cup of tea
I will
you know
go through a procedure
that will probably result
in me having a cup of tea if I'm
pretty good with the steps
and once I've
made tea, do I have tea? Yes
it's a single valued thing
now
my capacity to participate
in my
experience
fundamentally depends on
it not being single valued
right
and this is
where
Zen
kind of comes in
so
if you go back to the
first bookmark
facts
so again if the scope
of our concern is limited enough
facts are the result of limiting the
scope of one's concern
the scope of one's awareness
intention
purposive orientation
and this is
all denied
in the give us the facts culture
all of that is thrown
away
facts are just
truth
single valued
there's no such thing as a single
valued fact
there's no such thing as a single valued
anything except in language
or conception
or cognition
and
that particular exception
is lethal to the possibilities
of insight, intelligence, intimacy
life, origin
spirit, so forth
um
intimacies
involve relating
with manifolds right
multidimensional
this is just a toy the manifold thing
multidimensional bubbles
bubbles of many bubbles
each bubble being a dimension
and then their intersections
and the aspect
of our thinking mind
wants to basically throw all those bubbles away
collapse them down to the intersections
throw most of the intersections away
maybe all of them away
until just one stick figure is left
ah the books are just made of paper
just a bunch of paper in there
I don't read them books
I already know what they are
they're just paper
that's how this aspect
quote thinks
and it can't stand anything that it can't
reduce to a single valued
manipulable
it would destroy life
like given
um
authority
and
ah
what
energy
power
to create life
without a second thought
the same way that I would like to do away with machines
it would love to do away with organisms
and that aspect has
important
um useful features
but it
sucks as a god
it's just vampirically
torturously
horrifically lethal
and
this is the kind of a god
that we have here in the United States at the moment
the current president, who is, in fact, as stupid as he is cocksure.
You see, things are equivalent.
His cocksureness, 1,000%.
His stupidity, 1,000%.
They're just two faces of the same damn coin.
So, yeah, this aspect despises existence, and sees them as a threat to its dominance
and sovereignty over the single-valued evaluation of all phenomena, which in, you know, human
anti-civilizations is referred to as money or power, or, you know, is collapsed into
money or power and then transmitted among the elite.
And while the history and future of life on Earth and all of the humans suffer horribly
and, you know, irredeemably.
So, facts are local.
They have a local scope.
And you can say, well, no, there's facts that are non-local.
It's not untrue, but it's not very helpful, right?
You can say, well, there's a whole universe out there that you know nothing about.
That's a fact.
Well, it's not entirely true, because I am an exemplar or an idealization locally of
the universe.
Now, it might be true that I don't have a collection of representational data about
it, but I do actually have some representational data about it.
However, weird.
So, like, I have the representational data about it that I've received from the humans,
right?
Astronomers, physicists, philosophers, and so on.
And then I also have some representational data that's homegrown, right?
I've had a variety of direct experiences of origin and things that science has zero
grasp on.
So, you know, the fact...
So, there's a fact.
There's a cypress tree.
I'm putting my hand on it right now.
You can say, that's a fact.
Well, it's a fact for me, and it might be a fact that you've heard me say this, but
the scope of those facts is very limited, right?
It's not universal.
It's not even...
Like, the closer it is to me, the more...
The more factual it is.
But the facticity isn't the interesting property, except for the part of the, you know, mind
that acts as a sentinel, an arbiter of facticity.
Now, there is a language that humans are familiar with.
There is a language in which facticity has a...
Vastly different kind of scope.
And it's not a regular language, but I would classify it as a language.
There are other ways to classify it.
It's a heuristic instrument, or a library of heuristic instruments of the same type.
And that's mathematics, right?
But even the pure facticity...
Of a statement as simple as one plus one equals...
One plus one equals two.
Defeated some of the most amazing minds that have ever attempted to prove it, incontrovertibly.
And this is how we can...
This is part of how we can be clued in, that this whole system of facts is a charade.
Again, it becomes more and more of a charade the more it becomes conceptual,
the more it becomes linguistic.
Or the more that it becomes Aristotelianly logical.
Aristotelianly logical.
The, quote, law of the excluded middle.
A tree is never not a tree.
It's either a tree or not a tree.
That's not true.
That's true in language.
Right? Matching...
Matching pointers to reference.
Nominata to nominatum.
So, we confuse that truth with facticity.
And that is the beginning of the end of insight and intelligence.
And understanding and intimacy.
Participatory relationship.
If our concerns are narrow enough,
in other words, if we've thrown away enough of the manifold,
enough of the bubbling bubbles,
to produce standing, structured, explicit assertions,
and,
and,
and,
and,
and,
and,
and,
and,
and,
and,
and,
we do not remain aware of the process of having done that.
This is part of how much of science proceeds
and you can get a sort of mechanical grasp
and you can get a sort of mechanical grasp
and you can get a sort of mechanical grasp
on features of the Newtonian layer of phenomena
to produce predictable results in machines and so forth.
Yes, yes, all of this is true.
Wow.
Why am I concerned about this?
I'm concerned because these fictions cage the birds of our minds.
And they cage the history and future of our world.
And they torment it.
They torture it.
To produce what?
Gravestones?
Something like that.
No one would do this for one moment were they aware of it.
But what I'm really trying to say is that facticity is relative.
And it is the result of the purposive eviction of most of what's going on.
Anything that's not relative.
Anything that's not easily reproducible, because that's the goal of mechanism.
Easy reproducibility.
Consistent, simple.
You know, I turn the key or I push the button and the engine of the car starts up.
Every time.
Eventually not.
So what's the fact there?
That the button press starts the engine?
Well, that fact is temporally local.
See the problem?
It's local to a very specific place.
It's a very specific temporal sphere that has a beginning and an end.
There's a before of this engine and there's an after where the pushing of the button has no effect.
If I just take the battery out of the button device, no effect.
Is that a fact?
Local to the situation, yes.
Local to the purposes, yes.
Universally, no.
So facticity is relative.
Facts don't have this trenchant universality that we're trained to expect.
And the only language that has something that more or less resembles that is math.
But even in math, you know, math can't swallow math.
It's like that song from the 40s.
It's like that song from the 40s that was widely censored.
It's not going to eat itself.
Which was, you know, kind of a sexual reference.
So I just want you to see this locality of facts.
And in physics, this is turning out to be a serious problem.
Because we have this thing called the Heisenberg cut.
We have some no-go theorems and so forth.
But what's slowly dawning on the physics community is that experiments in one lab don't collapse the superposition for other labs or other observers.
And, you know, the communication of results from Alice to Bob has an effect.
But it's still...
It still doesn't collapse all superpositions, right?
The sort of superpositional collapse, which is a very problematical feature, that depends on Alice not being affected by her measurements, right?
Alice is seen as, quote, an objective observer, as is Bob.
And so, you know, in these theorems and thought experiments, there are no objective observers.
Any measurement changes the measurer, right?
If I get a text from you, it transforms my situation internally.
Just attending the text collapses my awareness in a certain array of ways, right?
And then I think about responses.
And then I think about responses.
And then I think about responses.
Or implications.
I make predictions and so forth.
I mean, this goes to my toy that organisms are, in a sense, can be conceived of as...
In a way, as proofreaders, in the physical layer, right?
The kind of knowledge that depends on facts has a natural scope in which it's pragmatic and useful.
The kind of knowledge that depends on facts has a natural scope in which it's pragmatic and useful.
And when it escapes that scope, it's radioactive.
It just kills everything.
Which is very obvious if you see, just look at what humans are up to as a species on Earth.
They are a topology, but the valleys are so powerful that the mountains don't matter.
They are a topology, but the valleys are so powerful that the mountains don't matter.
They are a topology, but the valleys are so powerful that the mountains don't matter.
So now I'm going to take a little time and talk some about Zen.
Yesterday I had a wonderful mini-adventure.
I was going to the restroom, walking to the restroom in the Botanical Gardens,
which is one of the better local restrooms if you want cleanliness and comfort.
It's not great.
It's not great, but it's okay.
So, you know, I was listening to essentially a foundation podcast on foundations of physics
and learning and wandering and forming my own toy theories that explain the paradoxes
and where the confusion is.
It's very easy to see where the confusion is.
It's surprising that more scientists don't see it.
I think they've been captured by presuppositions that are not just wrong,
they're as compellingly trap-like as they are wrong.
So once you adopt them, you're pretty much out of luck
until experiment completely violates them in some way.
So I was walking through a group of children who were overseen by a couple of people, and I was like,
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
I was amongst a couple of young adults, a man and a woman.
And I wasn't really paying close attention to the children.
I was aware of them.
And I heard this voice say, where are you going?
Or more like, where are you going?
And I turned and saw a child next to me
who seemed, you know,
ethical,
ethnically, partially Asian. And I said, do you mean me? And he said, yes. And I said,
I'm going to the bathroom. And he said, where are you going after that? And I said, well,
I'm going to go around this corner towards the pond. And I said, where are you going?
And he said, we're going to the redwood forest. I said, oh. And I noticed that he was wearing
a Minecraft t-shirt. And he was very much natural, naturally being a human being. I'll
get to that in a moment. And he said, how old are you?
And I said, 62. And I said, how old are you? And he said, seven. I said, wow.
And he said, now this isn't a perfect rendition. I remember some of the features, but not all of
them. He said, what is your birthday? But he kind of mumbled the last part of the sound,
right? Incomplete utterance.
And I told him. And he said, know the numbers. And so I told him the numbers. And he looked
really shocked. Obviously, he was capable. It's clear this young person was uniquely
minded and capable of doing math. Not necessarily explicit math, right? He didn't count the
numbers between. I'd already told him my age. That wasn't the important thing. He was trying
to determine the interval between, and he successfully did so, obviously, between my
birth year and this year. So he sort of probably blurrily subtracted my birth year from this
year. And he said, oh, you're really old. And I laughed.
And he said, yeah. Yeah, I am. And he said, soon you will pass away. And I laughed again.
And I said, yeah. And he was bemused. And we were just having a nice interaction. And I had
kind of visually checked in with the adults. And they were just kind of visually checking
in with me. Clearly, they were observing the interaction. And then I asked him about Minecraft.
And he said, do you know how to play Minecraft? And I said, actually, I didn't tell the truth.
I said, yes, but I haven't ever played Minecraft. I know a little bit about it. Right, it was
the fact problem. It was what I said factually. Well, not entirely. But I said, yes, but when
I was a kid, we had these little plastic blocks that we played with called Legos. Do you know
what those are? And he said, yeah. So we had this exchange, which was,
very profound in a number of ways. And then the woman, the young woman who was watching
him, the situation, walked up to him and said, he and I had exchanged our names. And she
said his name. And he said, you know, we don't, you know, name, we don't ask people
about Minecraft. We don't ask people about Minecraft. We don't ask people about Minecraft.
We don't ask about their ages. And we don't ask them about when they will die. And he
said, why not? And she said, we just don't do this. It's a rule. Now, I had a lot of
feelings at that moment.
I have been subject to similar structurings forged by authority in my own childhood. And
I'm very resistant to them. And they're not true. Literally, consider the language she
used. We just don't do that. Now, in the child's mind, it's very obvious
that we just did this. So we certainly do do this. I've just done this. And obviously,
if it's a rule, then nobody does it ever. And so forth, right? All of these, what should
we call them? Structured fictional imperatives.
So I turned to her and I said, I'm totally okay with this, in a happy way. I'm okay with
this. And she turned back to the young boy and said, he's okay with this, but we don't
do this.
Now, I don't know the backstory. And I suspect
that the young boy is relatively precocious. And that this presents problems for people trying
to structure his behavior. I mean, there's some backstory here, right? When I was young,
precocious is another word for spectrumy.
And these diagnostic criteria, where they're not extremely useful, right? There's a scope,
again, for these criteria. And where they're not useful, they're devastating. And nobody
seems to be ambiently aware of this problem. Well, not nobody, but very few people.
Now, the reason that I present this story is that I found the exchange extremely instructive.
I've been a Zen student for something like 40 years.
There's a long story of how that came to be true, involving reading Musashi,
a bookstore worker named Ishmael, who's now
Orochi and was a universalist pastor back then. Me reading Musashi,
thinking about going to Japan to study Zen, becoming fascinated by Zen from
reading Musashi, being a bit of a, you know, studying martial arts, being a bit
of an Asia-phile, studying calligraphy a bit, and going to the bookstore and
talking with Ishmael and having him, you know, like, what did you think of Musashi?
And I said, it's amazing. By the way, this is the historical novel about Musashi.
And I said, yeah, I've been thinking about selling all my books and maybe
going to Japan and going to
Zendo. And he said, well, you could do that, or you could come back here in
about 45 minutes when I get off work and we'll go to my Zen teacher. And I was
like, what? He's like, yeah, like a real Zen teacher. He's like, yeah, a real Zen teacher.
I was like, okay. And that's how I met John Tarrant Roshi, a Dharma heir of Robert Aitken Roshi.
And John founded the
California
Diamond Sangha. Back then that was a group of about 12 people who sat in his
living room. And I've been a Zen student since then. I don't think of myself as a
Buddhist. In fact, thinking of myself seems not very Zen-like. But the thing
that happened to me yesterday was that the natural spontaneous curiosity and
intimacy
of a child's mind met my structured mind, and we played together for a moment. And then, you know,
the, there's a trope I'm looking for, the hammer fell, right? The hammer, we don't do this.
Obviously, we've just been doing this. This is not done.
Now, we all have
an array of
that watches over propriety and we have conscience and all kinds of things that we have words for
anyway. What's actually going on is much more sophisticated than that.
So we have these sort of sentinels and arbiters that watch over what other people might think
or what we think other people are thinking or could think and this is a lot of what
produces interrupted speech, but it also produces interrupted being.
Now, I want to be relatively candid. I've rarely been to a Zenkai or a Sashin.
I think I've been to two, three, and they were brief.
The long-term, the short-term, the long-term, the long-term, the long-term, the long-term,
the longest one was three days and that was many, many years ago, like 37 years ago or
something. I've sat for a few thousand hours. I meditate regularly. Our tradition is Rinzai,
so we use koans, but it's not strictly Rinzai. So sometimes we do just sitting or,
what is it called? Ah, the word will come to me.
So I have experience of Zen meditation, but I'm not an expert and I'm not a Buddhist.
I study the Zen way,
by sitting Zazen. And talking about Zen is very similar to talking about kissing.
Go ahead, make some face noises about it. Though, you know, it's a topology.
I was listening to an interview between
Muho and someone who was a Buddhist. And he said, you know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
Muho seems to be perhaps a German man. And these are both people with
long deep Zen experience and Muho had had like ten questions.
And they were things like,
what is a Zen teacher? What is enlightenment? All these questions are very silly because
this what? What? What?
is a fundamental
instrument of dissociative
ignorance. What is this?
You've already lost your Zen.
Zen is gone. Make what?
Which is part of why we have this koan,
what is the sound of one hand clapping?
But I want to talk a little bit about
Zen today.
Zen is not a religion.
And it's not
a religion.
It's not a religion.
It's not a thing.
In a sense,
Zen
and kissing
are very similar
because
kissing is a thing
you become.
You become kissing.
If you're kissing,
truly, you're all in.
And Zen is like this.
It's like being all in.
And since you're all in,
there's
and you're aware
that you're
going toward all-in-ness.
So, you probably have thoughts,
and memories, and hunger,
and physical pain.
And sitting is mostly not fun.
It's rather arduous,
particularly if you're sitting for long periods of time.
Um...
It's...
It's...
It's...
And one way of understanding Zen is to move from evaluation into presence.
So it's a kind of a subtractive thing from one perspective.
And to pull into awareness the tendrils of investment that you are familiar with.
And just deeper and deeper.
.
.
And to presence.
And this idea in English we have this word emptiness.
And we're inclined to think of emptiness as there is nothing there.
But there is no nothing.
.
Emptiness and nothing are not the same thing in these traditions.
It's basically one way to think about emptiness
.
is origin, or origende, right?
Origin and cessation together at once.
Cessation of what?
Of splitting, right?
You unsplit, unsplit, unsplit,
until, not until,
you just keep unsplitting.
And the unsplitting is infinitely deep.
And so, I want to share
the Heart Sutra,
which I intone prior to sitting daily.
And it goes like this.
Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva
practicing the Prajnaparamita
clearly saw that all five skandhas are empty,
transforming anguish and distress.
Shariputra,
form is,
no other than emptiness.
Emptiness,
no other than form.
Form is exactly emptiness.
Emptiness exactly form.
Sensation,
perception,
conception,
consciousness
are also like this.
Shariputra,
all things are essentially empty,
not born,
not destroyed,
not stained,
not pure.
Without loss,
without gain.
Therefore, in emptiness,
there is no form,
no sensation,
perception,
conception,
consciousness,
no eye,
ear, nose,
tongue,
body,
mind,
no color,
sound,
scent,
taste,
touch,
thought,
no seeing,
and so on to,
no thinking,
no ignorance,
and also no ending of ignorance.
And so on to,
no old age and death,
and also no ending of old age and death.
No anguish,
cause of anguish,
cessation,
path,
no wisdom,
and no attainment,
as there is nothing to attain.
The Bodhisattva lives in the form of the body,
the body,
the mind,
the mind,
and the body,
the mind,
and therefore no fear.
The Bodhisattva lives by Prajnaparamita with no hindrance in the body or mind,
no hindrance and therefore no fear.
Far beyond elusive thinking,
right here is Nirvana.
All Buddhas of past,
present,
and future live by Prajnaparamita.
Embodying Anuttara,
Samyak,
Sambodhi,
Samyak, Sambodhi,
Sameunge,
Mahayana,
etc.
Are- Donc,
no restrictions.
Whatever is going to go wrong,
let go and just grab a few seconds,
I'm going to be paying attention to everything that is going on.
Amen.

Truly uncomfortable for me but no reason.
What is it you desire?
To be an practitioner.
A person,
a 통 of mountains,
a destroyer,
and nothing but bad things.
Mindful insight up,
being some tool,
isjulast 여ال nigar,
about thoughtsand feelings.
I started to learn love skills,
do recordings,
love text books,

Now this is the English version of the Prajnaparamita Heart Sutra.
In it, Avalokiteshvara
a bodhisattva
is speaking to Shariputra
so that you know what these two names are.
And you can see
the essence
of Zen practice
encoded here.
This isn't Dharin knowledge.
This I have heard. This I have been shown.
And so what Zen is
isn't something you get.
And I remember
a strange look on my teacher's face when I came
requested to learn Zen with him.
And traditionally,
I don't recall the actual exchange,
but there was a feature of it
that was traditional
where the teacher basically tells you
go away.
This was much more severe
in other times and places
in Japan, China, India.
It's not a recruitment game.
And when someone shows up
and they want to study Zen,
most of the time
they've got everything backwards.
They think they're going to get something.
And what they're going to get
is enlightenment.
This is not really a thing.
There are experiences.
We have words for them.
Moksha.
In Hindu,
the direct experience of the mind of God.
Satori or Kensho in Zen.
And also,
what is it?
Another word I'm at a loss for.
It's because I get it confused with Moksha.
There's a word for
the kinds of experiences
that are deceptive,
but often precede
Satori or Kensho.
Sometimes these are visionary experiences.
Now, I've sat for a long time,
and I've had very few
non-ordinary experiences
during Zen sitting.
None of them resemble Kensho or Satori,
which are not equivalent with enlightenment
and are not accomplishments.
Remember in the Heart Sutra,
no attainment,
for there is nothing to attain.
And this focus on emptiness,
emptiness of what?
Emptiness of qualities?
Emptiness of thinking?
This could be understood, though,
not as emptiness,
but as pure undifferentiated potential,
or at least,
as mostly undifferentiated potential.
This would be like
placing your mind in origin,
or origende,
origin plus the ending,
together,
without conflict.
Annihilation is not a state.
It's a...
It's not a mode.
In fact,
there is nothing it is.
Similarly,
there is nothing it is not.
So it is the end of discursive splitting,
and the annihilation of this discursive splitting,
me,
them,
self,
other,
origin,
ending,
heaven,
earth,
hell,
right,
all of these distinctions,
gone.
This is what you are coming from,
I would say.
You are arriving moment to moment from this,
disappearing moment to moment into this.
This is why
Avalokiteshvara says
all of these negative statements,
right,
no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind, no color, sound, scent, taste, touch, thought, no seeing, and so on, to no thinking,
he's not telling you what enlightenment is.
He's unsplitting the splits.
And so annihilation in this sense,
and emptiness in this sense,
they are not dead inside things,
or states, or modes.
Um,
they are
unmitigated intimacy
with origin,
being,
arising,
departing,
front,
back,
inside,
outside,
self,
other,
up,
down,
hot,
cold,
black,
white,
morning,
night,
sun,
moon,
father,
you know,
all these things disappear.
This is resonantly transcendent
of all qualities and perspectives.
Zen, really though,
is not an achievement.
You don't,
uh,
enlightenment is not an achievement.
It's the opposite of achievements.
This is why Avalokiteshvara says,
um,
no attainment,
for there is nothing to attain.
This isn't a joke,
and it's not tricky language.
Right?
This is all splitting,
collapsing into origin,
and even the before of origin.
Now,
Zen,
you know,
it's not an idea.
It's not even really a practice.
These are just words we use
so that we can,
you know,
give the grasping thing
in our mind
something to,
uh,
mess around with.
But really, Zen is actually
there's sort of two ways to think about it,
that are,
well, no,
it's not true.
There are two perspectives that,
uh,
given my current orientation and purposes,
um,
are near to hand.
And the first is spontaneous,
free,
uh,
relation,
awareness,
intimacy,
unsplitting,
playful,
presence.
Like the child
in my story earlier.
He showed me what this was like,
because I have forgotten.
Right?
I would very much like
to be as brave
as the child.
Very much like to be as brave as the child,
as the child
who approached me.
In every aspect of my life,
I would like to be like this child.
But I am inhibited
and concerned
with what others might think,
or not think.
Or if they will misunderstand me,
or judge me,
or so forth.
Or if my conscience
will,
you know,
crop up
and say,
I'm a bad boy.
Distinction.
Splitting.
So in one sense, Zen
is unfettered spontaneity.
And it's not unfettered as a state.
It's actively unfettering.
In another sense,
Zen is specifically
the posture and practice
of Zen meditation.
Not theoretically,
not as a concept,
not as an idea.
The same way kissing
is, you know,
we have a word for it,
or breathing air.
Zen involves the awareness
of breathing,
the awareness of the body.
And if appropriate,
the focus in the mind
on a koan.
Explaining what a koan is,
you know,
conceptually,
it's not very hard.
What it actually is,
is impossible.
And the koans
don't really make any sense
to the rational mind,
and the rational mind's
access to their,
uh,
power
is zero.
None.
If you read a book of koans,
it will not help you.
You probably won't even be puzzled.
You'll just think this is nonsense.
Most likely.
The rational mind
will certainly think that.
I've worked with a koan
for 40 years or so.
I mean, around there.
It's a koan often given first.
But it's not really important here.
Zen
is the,
the doing of zazen.
That's what it is.
It's also this,
perhaps this other thing,
this unfettered
presence,
of awareness,
unattached,
to splitting
and the products of splitting.
The incredible energy
that arises
when the mind
retrieves its investment,
investments,
in identity,
quality,
characteristic,
past,
future,
history.
Um,
the power of this mind,
this unfettered mind,
it could literally
say to the mountain,
go to the moon,
and the mountain would go there.
It would not do this.
But this is available.
All of the things we think of as miraculous,
they are not miraculous.
Uh,
they are the product of
the
boundless energy.
Um,
the spirit of truth
and beauty,
which is no spirit
at all.
We, in our minds,
are like cities.
We have to keep the whole city
filled with energy.
Past,
history,
future,
self,
other,
green,
blue,
hot,
cold,
black,
white,
day,
night,
good,
bad,
tasty,
disgusting.
And this is not,
you know,
all bad.
Um,
but these formations
trap our,
our origin spirit energy.
And this is sort of what is meant,
uh,
by the very complex idea
that I will not hear
dealt into called karma.
So,
you know,
the child,
he was being very zen,
in my view.
Spontaneous, playful, curious, alive.
Uh,
and then the adult,
just like the thinking mind,
came over and said,
we don't do this.
This is just not done.
But he was like a spark
or a star
in my life
and in my day.
He
transmitted to me
directly,
like an old zen teacher,
the spirit of zen.
Spontaneous,
unfettered,
presence
of being,
non-being,
origin,
annihilation.
In fact,
he almost did
like a classical,
uh,
teisho,
right?
A classical zen teisho.
Or even a koan.
Where are you going?
This is often,
this is often how a conversation
with a roshi begins
when you first meet them.
Except usually,
um, it will be,
uh,
where have you come from?
How old are you?
These are not trick questions,
but they are,
they have a quality of mischievous,
uh,
testing.
Right?
Are you,
are you here now?
Yeah?
Are you here right now?
Where are you?
Who are you?
Show me your credentials,
right?
Not in the sense of,
um,
uh,
your degrees
or your vocation.
Show me what is essential about you.
And often when,
in the koans,
you know,
uh,
a monk or,
uh,
one who,
who wants to study Zen will come
and meet the teacher
and the teacher will
investigate them in a way.
Uh,
the Zen way of investigating is very
formless and slippery.
Good luck
if you try to figure it out.
It's not using the principles
that you're used to using
in investigations.
Um,
the Zen teacher can sort of tell
how many buckets of water
you're carrying simultaneously
and which ones matter,
which ones are really heavy.
Yeah.
And,
if you can slip out of the buckets
and suddenly appear
and disappear
fluidly,
then this may influence you.
The emptiness.
So Zen is,
is really,
it's something you get rid of,
right?
Um,
it's like a boat that you throw away,
uh,
when you get to the,
where the sun is from.
Um,
it's unsplitting
from one perspective.
These are some things,
they are all wrong,
right?
All the things I have said,
this is like heaping garbage on garbage
or putting poo on my face
and then,
you know,
going up on stage.
And you'll hear this kind of talk
in Zen books as well.
But it's something,
yeah?
I have said something that,
so that those who follow me
will know something of one of the aspects
of my path as a being
in this world,
in this incarnation.
Um,
actually,
there are no incarnations.
This is why,
if you listen to the words of the Heart Sutra,
and by the way,
that's normally intoned with like a frog drum,
right?
You're going to be like,
Pak, Pak, Pak, Pak,
Shari,
Putra,
all things are.
Um,
there's the frog drum,
which has a name,
I can't recall it.
Most of us spend our lives
in a skeletal form.
And the skeletal form is all of these,
they're not just attachments,
though,
this is the word that's commonly used.
Um,
we are splitting into,
um,
feature sets,
we are splitting into fictions
that we are,
that we habitually sustain,
and identify with.
And,
so Zen is sort of the,
the s,
the slow or sudden retraction
of all such investments.
Enlightenment is not a thing,
it's not a what,
there's no what is enlightenment.
Um,
what I heard yesterday was something
I had not heard before,
that I found interesting,
uh,
which is that someone said,
there are no enlightened beings,
there is only enlightened behavior.
This is also not true.
Both things are not true.
It is not true that there are enlightened beings,
and it is not true that there are no enlightened beings.
Uh,
they are provisional.
These are,
these are things one can say.
Right?
All that provisionality,
wipe it away,
and the essential matter will become clear,
as you.
I'm not encouraging anyone to study Zen.
I'm not singing my praises
for being a Zen student.
I am stupid,
and a human,
and trapped up in all kinds of mess.
Um,
but I do practice sitting.
It's very important,
uh,
in my life.
Yeah,
I can't find the Japanese words that I'm looking for.
It's okay.
So, beautiful spirits,
grateful for this time together today.
Um,
hope you have found
some inspiration and beauty and medicine
in our walks together.
And, uh,
I honor the spirit of the beings who
seek the liberation
of all beings and the reconciliation
of beauty
and origin.
In our lives and experiences and situations.
I honor all these beings, yeah.
May your path be beautiful and liberating,
healing and loving,
playful
and spirited.
May your problems slide off of you like rain,
evaporating away.
Uh,
may you learn to become,
to fulfill the promise of our human incarnations
with and for each other and the sake of all beings.
Thank you for joining me.
If you feel so inclined,
take a moment to like or comment
or ask a question
or render a severe criticism
or share,
uh,
my recording
or support my work if you wish to.
Grateful for those of you who do
and all of you who listen.
Thank you for joining me.
I look forward to learning
and unforgetting
together again
very soon.
Bye-bye for now.
